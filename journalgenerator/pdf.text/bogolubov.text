\section{Introduction}

The general identifiability problem for dynamical systems is
formulated as follows: given a dynamical system $S(\lambda,t)$
depending on a parameter $\lambda$, is it possible to determine the
value of $\lambda$ from observation of a solution (or a function of a
solution)?

This problem has attracted a lot of attention. Let us mention, for
example, the work [8], in which general conditions of
identifiability were obtained. In a recent work [16], the
identifiability problem was considered for an analytic
finite-dimensional system of differential equations; it was shown
in [16] that if such a system depends on $r$ parameters, then the
parameters are identifiable by any randomly chosen set of $2r+1$
experiments.

We are interested in this paper in the problem of local parametric
identifiability near a given value $\lambda_0$ of the parameter. In our case
local parametric identifiability at $\lambda_0$ means that the observed
values for $\lambda=\lambda_0$ differ from those for $\lambda$ with small
positive values of $|\lambda-\lambda_0|$.

We study evolutionary systems generated by semilinear parabolic equations.
From the practical point  of view, it is impossible to observe exact
solutions of such equations; it is only possible to observe their values
at discrete points or to observe approximate solutions given, for example,
by discretization schemes.

Our goal is to give sufficient conditions under which the problem
is locally identifiable by observations of a solution with initial
values from an open and dense subset of the phase space.

In Sec.~2, we observe discretizations of exact solutions at
growing time moments $Tn$ (where $T$ is fixed and $n$ grows) with
increasing accuracy as $n\to\infty$. We give sufficient conditions
of local parametric identifiability (The\-o\-rem~2.1) and show
that these conditions can be checked for the
Chaffee\,--\,In\-fan\-te problem (Theorem~2.2).

In Sec.~3, we observe approximate solutions given by a
semi-im\-pli\-cit discretization of a parabolic equation.
Sufficient conditions of local parametric identifiability are
given (Theorem~3.1); it is worth noting that in this case we do
not have to increase the accuracy of observations as time grows.

In Sec.~4,we discuss some applications.

\section{Discretization of a solution}

Consider a semilinear parabolic equation
$$
u_t=u_{xx}+f(\lambda,u),
\eqno(2.1)
$$
where $x\in(0,\pi)$, $t>0$, with Dirichlet boundary conditions
$$
u(0,t)=u(\pi,t)=0.
\eqno(2.2)
$$
In equation (2.1), $\lambda\in R$ is a parameter. Let
$u(\lambda,x,t,u_0)$ be a classical solution of equation (2.1),
i.\,e., $u\in C_{x,t}^{2,1}$, with the initial value
$$
u(\lambda,x,0,u_0)=u_0(x).
\eqno(2.3)
$$
We study the problem of local parametric identifiability for
problem (2.1)--(2.3) in the following form.

Fix a number $T>0$. For any natural number $n$, we fix a natural
number $m(n)$ so that
$$
m(n)\to\infty, \quad n\to\infty.
\eqno(2.4)
$$

Consider the finite arrays
$$
V(\lambda,n,u_0)=\{u(\lambda,kh_n,Tn,u_0) : \quad 0<k\le m(n)-1\}
$$
defined for $n>0$, where
$$
h_n=\frac{\pi}{m(n)}.
$$
The array $V(\lambda,n,u_0)$ is the set of values of a solution
$u(\lambda,x,t,u_0)$ on a finite subset
$$
\{(kh_n,Tn) : \quad 0<k\le m(n)-1\}
$$
of the set $(0,\pi)\times\{Tn\}$.

Condition (2.4) means that we observe the solution at time moments
$Tn$ with increasing accuracy as $n\to\infty$.

First we fix the spaces we work with.


We consider the standard Sobolev space $H_{[0,\pi]}^1$ with the
norm defined by
$$
 \|u\|^2=\int\limits_0^\pi |u|^2dx +\int\limits_0^\pi
\left|\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right|^2 dx.
$$
Let $H_0^1$ be the following subspace of $H_{[0,\pi]}^1$:
$$
 H_0^1=\left\{ u\in H_{[0,\pi]}^1:\ u(0)=u(\pi)=0\right\}.
$$
We use below the norm
 $$
 \|u\|=\left(\int\limits_0^\pi
 \left|\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right|^2 dx\right)^{1/2},
 $$
which is equivalent to the above-mentioned norm.
 We also consider the Sobolev space $H_0^2\subset H_0^1$ with the
 norm
 $$
 \|u\|_2=\left(\int\limits_0^\pi
 \left|\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\right|^2 dx\right)^{1/2}
 $$
 We assume that $f(\lambda,\cdot)\in C^2(R).$

Our basic structural assumption on the nonlinearity $f$ is as follows:
there exists a function $C(\lambda)$, $\lambda\in R$, such that
$$
uf(\lambda,u)\le C(\lambda).
\eqno(2.5)
$$
It is well known [9] that under condition (2.5) problem
(2.1)--(2.3) generates an evolutionary system $S(\lambda,t)$,
$t>0$, in the space $H_0^1$, so that for any $u_0\in H_0^1$, the
solution
$$
u(\lambda,x,t,u_0)=S(\lambda,t)u_0(x)
$$
is defined for all $t>0$. In addition, condition (2.5) implies
that $S(\lambda,t)$ has a global attractor $A(\lambda)$ in $H_0^1$
[9, 15].

Let us give the main definition.

We say that problem (2.1)--(2.3) is locally identifiable at
$\lambda=\lambda_0$ via refining observations of a solution
$u(\lambda_0,x,t,u_0)$ if there exists a number $\varepsilon>0$
such that for any $\lambda$, $0<|\lambda-\lambda_0|<\varepsilon$,
and for any $v_0\in H_0^1$ there exists $n_0>0$ such that
$$
V(\lambda_0,n,u_0)\ne V(\lambda,n,v_0)
$$
for $n\ge n_0$.

This definition corresponds to the general definition of local
identifiability of nonlinear systems of ordinary differential
equations via observations of their solutions at discrete time
moments [4].


Denote by $F(\lambda)$, $\lambda\in R$, the set of fixed points of the
system $S(\lambda,t)$. Obviously, a function $u(x)$ is a fixed point of
$S(\lambda,t)$ if and only if $u(x)$ is a solution of the following
boundary-va\-lue problem:
$$
\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}+f(\lambda,u)=0, \quad u(0)=u(\pi)=0.
\eqno(2.6)
$$

It is known that any system $S(\lambda,t)$ has a global Lyapunov
function
 $$
 V(u)=\int\limits_0^\pi\left(\frac12|\nabla u|^2-F(u)\right)dx,
 $$
 where $F$ is the antiderivative of $f$ with respect to $u$; this
 function decreases along nonconstant solutions [9,15]. Thus, for
 any
 $u_0\in H_0^1$, the solution $S(\lambda,t)u_0$ tends to
the set $F(\lambda)$. If we denote by $\omega(\lambda,u_0)$ the
$\omega$-li\-mit set of the solution $S(\lambda,t)u_0$ [15], then
the following inclusions obviously hold:
$$
\omega(\lambda,u_0)\subset F(\lambda)\subset A(\lambda), \quad
u_0\in H_0^1, \quad \lambda\in R.
\eqno(2.7)
$$

Now let us impose the following condition on $f(\lambda,u)$ at
$\lambda_0$.

{\it Condition I at $\lambda_0$.} For any $\delta>0$, there exist
numbers $v^+\in(0,\delta)$, $v^-\in(-\delta,0)$, and $\mu>0$ such
that
$$
f(\lambda,v^+)\ne f(\lambda_0,v^+)
\quad {\rm and} \quad f(\lambda,v^-)\ne f(\lambda_0,v^-)
$$
for $0<|\lambda-\lambda_0|<\mu$.

Obviously, {\it Condition I at $\lambda_0$} is a corollary of the
following condition.

{\it Condition II at $\lambda_0$.} The function $f(\lambda,u)$ is
continuously differentiable in $\lambda$ on the set $R\times\{0\}$
and
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial\lambda}(\lambda,0)
\bigg|_{\lambda=\lambda_0} \ne0.
$$

The main result of Sec.~2 is the following statement.

{\bf Theorem 2.1.} {\it Assume that

{\rm (a)} all fixed points of the system $S(\lambda_0,t)$ are hyperbolic;

{\rm (b)} if $f(\lambda_0,0)=0$, then the fixed point $u\equiv0$ of
$S(\lambda_0,t)$ is unstable;

{\rm (c)} Condition I at $\lambda_0$ is satisfied.

Then there exists an open and dense subset $\cal H$ of the space
$H_0^1$ such that, for $u_0\in{\cal H}$, problem (2.1)--(2.2) is
locally identifiable at $\lambda_0$ via refining observations of
the solution $u(\lambda_0,x,t,u_0)$.

If $f(\lambda_0,0)\ne0$, then one may take ${\cal H}=H_0^1$. }

We begin the proof of Theorem 2.1 with an auxiliary statement.

{\bf Lemma 2.1.} {\it Let condition I at $\lambda_0$ be satisfied.
If $u(\lambda_0,x)$ is a nonzero solution of the boundary-va\-lue
problem $(2.6)$, then there exists $\Delta>0$ such that, for any
solution $u(\lambda,x)$ of $(2.6)$ with
$0<|\lambda-\lambda_0|<\Delta$,
$$
u(\lambda,x)\not\equiv u(\lambda_0,x).
\eqno(2.8)
$$
}

{\it Proof.} Since $u(\lambda_0,x)\not\equiv0$,
$$
u^*=\max\limits_{x\in[0,\pi]} |u(\lambda_0,x)|>0.
$$

Apply {\it Condition I at $\lambda_0$} to find numbers
$v^+\in(0,u^*)$, $v^-\in(-u^*,0)$, and the corresponding $\mu>0$.
We claim that we may take $\Delta=\mu$.

Fix $x_0\in(0,\pi)$ such that
$$
u^*=|u(\lambda_0,x_0)|.
$$

Assume that $u(\lambda_0,x_0)>0$ (the case $u(\lambda_0,x_0)<0$ is
considered similarly). Then there exists $x_1\in(0,\pi)$ such that
$$
u(\lambda_0,x_1)=v^+
$$
(since $u(\lambda_0,0)=0$).

Take $\lambda\in R$ with $0<|\lambda-\lambda_0|<\Delta$ and any
solution $u(\lambda,x)$ of the corresponding problem (2.6). If
$u(\lambda,x_1)\ne u(\lambda_0,x_1)$, then (2.8) holds. Otherwise,
$u(\lambda,x_1)=u(\lambda_0,x_1)=v^+$, and it follows from {\it
Condition I at $\lambda_0$} that
$$
\left.\frac{\partial ^2u(\lambda_0,x)}{\partial x^2}\right|_{x=x_1}
=-f(\lambda_0,v^+)
\ne-f(\lambda,v^+)
=\left.\frac{\partial ^2u(\lambda,x)}{\partial x^2}\right|_{x=x_1}.
$$
This proves (2.8).

 {\bf Corollary.} {\it The sets of nonzero fixed paints of the
 systems $S(\lambda_0,t)$ and $S(\lambda,t)$ are disjoint if 
 $0<|\lambda-\lambda_0|<\Delta$.}

Let us proceed with the proof of Theorem 2.1.

Take an array $V(\lambda,n,u_0)$ and construct a continuous
piecewise-li\-ne\-ar function $v^*(\lambda,x,n,u_0)$ on $[0,\pi]$ as
follows:
$$
v^*(\lambda,kh_n,n,u_0)=u(\lambda,kh_n,Tn,u_0),
\quad k=0,...,m(n),
$$
and $v^*(\lambda,\cdot,n,u_0)$ is linear on any segment
$$
\left[kh_n,(k+1)h_n\right], \quad k=0,...,m(n)-1.
$$

It is known (see [1, Chapter 1]) that, for any $\lambda\in R$, the
operator $S(\lambda,t)$ is a bounded operator from $H_0^1$ into
$H_0^2$, i.\,e., for any $v_0\in H_0^1$ there exists a constant
$K=K(\lambda,v_0)$ such that
$$
\|S(\lambda,t)v_0\|_2\le K, \quad t>0.
$$
Elementary estimates (see [2] for details) show that, for any
$v_0\in H_0^1$ and any $\lambda\in R$,
$$
\|v^*(\lambda,x,n,v_0)-u(\lambda,x,Tn,v_0)\|\to0 \quad {\rm as}
\quad n\to\infty.
\eqno(2.9)
$$

Assume that $f(\lambda_0,0)=0$ (the case $f(\lambda_0,0)\ne0$ is
more simple since in this case $u\equiv0$ is not a fixed point of
the system $S(\lambda_0,t)$).

Assumptions (a) and (b) of our theorem imply that $u\equiv0$ is a
hyperbolic unstable fixed point of the system $S(\lambda_0,t)$, hence its
stable manifold, $W^S(0)$, has positive codimension in the space $H_0^1$.

Obviously, in this case the set
$$
{\cal H}=H_0^1\setminus W^S(0)
\eqno(2.10)
$$
is an open and dense subset of $H_0^1$.

Take $u_0\in{\cal H}$ and the corresponding solution
$u(\lambda_0,x,t,u_0)$. It was mentioned above that
$$
u(\lambda_0,x,t,u_0)\to F(\lambda_0)
\quad {\rm as} \quad t\to\infty.
$$

Since all fixed points of $S(\lambda_0,t)$ are hyperbolic, they
are isolated. The global attractor $A(\lambda_0)$ is compact and
contains all fixed points of $S(\lambda_0,t)$, hence the set
$F(\lambda_0)$ is finite. Since the set $\omega(\lambda_0,u_0)$ is
connected [15], it coincides with a single fixed point; denote
this point by $w(x)$. It follows from (2.10) that
$w(x)\not\equiv0$.

Apply Lemma 2.1 to find, for the solution $w(x)$, a number
$\varepsilon>0$ such that if $0<|\lambda-\lambda_0|<\varepsilon$,
then any solution $u(\lambda,x)$ of (2.6) satisfies
$$
u(\lambda,x)\not\equiv w(x).
\eqno(2.11)
$$

We claim that this number $\varepsilon>0$ has the property described in
the definition of local identifiability via refining observations.

Indeed, take $\lambda$ such that $0<|\lambda-\lambda_0|<\varepsilon$ and
an arbitrary initial function $v_0\in H_0^1$.

The set $\omega(\lambda,v_0)$ is a closed subset of the compact
set $A(\lambda)$ (see inclusion (2.7)). This set consists of
solutions $u(\lambda,x)$ of the boundary-va\-lue problem (2.6).
Hence, inequality (2.11) implies that there exists a positive
number $a>0$ such that
$$
{\rm dist}(w(x),\omega(\lambda,v_0))=a,
\eqno(2.12)
$$
where dist is the distance generated by the norm of the space $H_0^1$.

To obtain a contradiction, assume that there exists a sequence
$n_m$ of natural numbers such that $n_m\to\infty$ as $m\to\infty$
and
$$
V(\lambda_0,n_m,u_0)=V(\lambda,n_m,v_0)
\eqno(2.13)
$$
for all $m$.

Construct the corresponding continuous piecewise-linear
functions\break $v^*(\lambda_0,x,n_m,u_0)$ and
$v^*(\lambda,x,n_m,v_0)$; for brevity, we denote these functions
by $v_{0,m}^*(x)$ and $v^*_m(x)$, respectively. By (2.13),
$$
v^*_{0,m}(x)\equiv v^*_m(x)
\eqno(2.14)
$$
for all $m$.

Since
$$
\|u(\lambda_0,x,n_m,u_0)-w(x)\|\to0,
$$
it follows from (2.9) that
$$
\|v^*_{0,m}(x)-w(x)\|\to0
\eqno(2.15)
$$
as $m\to\infty$.

Similarly, since
$$
{\rm dist}\left(u(\lambda,x,n_m,v_0),\omega(\lambda,v_0)\right)\to0,
$$
it follows from (2.9) that
$$
{\rm dist}\left(v^*_m(x),\omega(\lambda,v_0)\right)\to0
\eqno(2.16)
$$
as $m\to\infty$.

Combining relations (2.12), (2.14), (2.15) and (2.16), we get the
desired contradiction. Theorem~2.1 is proved.

 {\bf Remark 2.1.} I.\,Kukavica and J.\,C.\,Robinson in [12]
 studied the problem of distinguishability of global attractors
 for PDEs (in particular, for reaction-diffusion equations of the
 type of Eq.\,(2.1)). They show that it is possible to
 distinguish between different elements of the attractor by
 measurement of the solutions at almost every set of $k$ points of
 the domain (where $k$ is estimated by the dimension of the
 attractor).

 Our approach is based on a quite different idea. Though we refer
 to the existence of the global attractor (and to some of its
 properties), we do not have to find its elements; we just start
 with an almost arbitrary initial point $u_0$ of the phase space
 and compare the solution $S(\lambda_0,t)u_0$ with {\bf any}
 solution $S(\lambda,t)v$.

 The proof of the main result in [12] in the nonanalytic case is
 based on a theorem by C.\,C.\.Poon [14] stating that differences
 of solutions on the global attractor have ``finite order of
 vanishing''. Since no such result is available for differences of
 arbitrary solutions $S(\lambda_0,t)u$ and $S(\lambda,t)v$ with
 $\lambda\ne\lambda_0$, we cannot replace our condition of
 refining the space resolution by measurements at a finite set of points whose cardinality does not depend on the unknown value of $\lambda$ (but our results in Sec.\,3 show that the latter is possible if we work with a discretization of Eq.\,(2.1)).
 
 It follows from Lemma~2.1 that if {\it Condition I at} $\lambda_0$ is satisfied, then, for any $\lambda$ with $0<|\lambda-\lambda_0|<\Delta$, there exists $\delta(\lambda)>0$ such that
 $$
 \|u-v\|\geq\delta(\lambda)
 $$
 for any nonzero fixed points $u$ of $S(\lambda_0,t)$ and $v$ of $S(\lambda,t)$, respectively. Let us note that $\delta(\lambda)\to0$ as $\lambda\to\lambda_0$ in our case, since for hyperbolic fixed points $u$ of $S(\lambda_0,t)$ there exist families of fixed points $v(\lambda)$ of $S(\lambda,t)$ such that $\|u-v(\lambda)\|\to0$ as $\lambda\to\lambda_0$ (see [9]).
 
 If we fix $\lambda$ with $0<|\lambda-\lambda_0|<\Delta$, $u_0\not\in W^S(0)$, and an arbitrary $v_0$, then there exist $w(x)\in F(\lambda_0)$, $w(x)\not\equiv0$, $u(\lambda,x)\in F(\lambda)$, and $T(\lambda)>0$ such that
 $$
 \|u(\lambda_0,x,t,u_0)-w(x)\|<\delta(\lambda)/4
 $$
 and
 $$
 \|u(\lambda,x,t,v_0)-u(\lambda,x)\|<\delta(\lambda)/4
 $$
 for $t\geq T(\lambda)$.
 
 At the same time, the proof of estimate (2.9) in [2] shows that there exists $N_0=N_0(\lambda)$ such that if the discretization space step is
 $$
 h=\frac{\pi}{N_0},
 $$
 then the corresponding piecewise-linear functions $v^*(\lambda_0,x,n,u_0)$ and
  $v^*(\lambda,x,n,v_0)$ (constructed by the mesh with fixed step $h$) satisfy the inequalities
 $$
 \|v^*(\lambda_0,x,n,u_0)-u(\lambda_0,x,Tn,u_0)\|<\delta(\lambda)/4
 $$
 and
 $$
 \|v^*(\lambda,x,n,v_0)-u(\lambda,x,Tn,v_0)\|<\delta(\lambda)/4,
 $$
 respectively, for $n\geq1$.
 
 It follows that the solutions $u(\lambda_0,x,t,u_0)$ and $u(\lambda,x,t,v_0)$ are distinguishable by observations at a fixed (not refined) mesh.
 
 But our reasoning shows that the step $h$ of this mesh will depend on $\lambda$, and we have no hope to get reasonable estimates of this dependence (since our {\it Condition I at} $\lambda_0$ does not exclude cases of very degenerate behavior of $f(\lambda,u)$ near $\lambda_0$).
 
 For this reason, we prefer to formulate Theorem~2.1 for measurements with refining space resolution.
 
 


{\bf Remark 2.2.} Let us discuss the assumptions of Theorem~2.1.
While it is relatively easy to check conditions (b) and (c),
condition (a) does not seem very natural.

Nevertheless, let us recall that, by the main result of [5], if we
consider, instead of equation (2.1), an equation without a
parameter,
$$
u_t=u_{xx}+f(u),
$$
then any fixed point of the corresponding evolutionary system is
hyperbolic for nonlinearities $f(u)$ belonging to a residual subset of the
function space $C^k(R,R)$, $k\ge2$ (i.\,e., for a countable intersection
of dense and open subsets of this function space).

Conditions of Theorem~2.1 are easily checked for a
Chaffee\,--\,In\-fan\-te problem [9, 6] with linear dependence on
the parameter.

Assume that $f(\lambda,u)=\lambda g(u)$ in $(2.1)$, where the
function $g\in C^2(R,R)$ satisfies the following conditions:
$$
\begin{array}{l}
({\rm CI1}) \quad g(0)=0, \quad g'(0)=1;\\[5pt]\\
({\rm CI2}) \quad\mathop{\lim\sup}\limits_{|u|\to\infty}\displaystyle\frac{g(u)}{u}\le0;\\[5pt]\\
({\rm CI3}) \quad ug''(u)<0\ {\rm for}\ u\ne0.
\end{array}
$$

A typical example of a function $g(u)$ satisfying conditions (CI1)--(CI3)
is $g(u)=u-u^3$.

It is known [9] that, under these conditions, the corresponding
semigroup $S(\lambda,t)$ has a global attractor for any
$\lambda>0$, and its trajectories tend to the union of fixed
points as $t\to\infty$.

In addition, it is known that if
$$
\lambda>1,\ \lambda\ne m^2,\ m\in Z,
\eqno(2.17)
$$
then any fixed point of $S(\lambda,t)$ is hyperbolic, while the zero fixed
point is unstable.

Finally, it is easy to see that if a function $g(u)$ satisfies
condition (CI3), then it has not more than 2 nonzero roots. Hence,
{\it Condition I} is obviously satisfied by $f(\lambda,u)=\lambda
g(u)$ at any $\lambda_0\ne0$.

Thus, the following statement is a corollary of Theorem~2.1.

{\bf Theorem 2.2.} {\it Assume that $f(\lambda,u)=\lambda g(u)$ in
equation $(2.1)$, where the function $g(u)$ satisfies conditions
{\rm (CI1)--(CI3)}. Then, for any $\lambda_0$ satisfying
inequalities $(2.17)$, there exists an open and dense subset $\cal
H$ of the space $H_0^1$ such that, for $u_0\in{\cal H}$, problem
$(2.1)-(2.3)$ is locally identifiable at $\lambda_0$ via refining
observations of the solution $u(\lambda_0,x,t,u_0)$. }

This theorem generalizes the main result of [2].

\section{Discretization of the equation}

Let us consider the following usual semi-implicit discretization
of equation (2.1). We fix a natural number $N$, set
$d=\displaystyle\frac{\pi}{N+1}$, and let $h>0$ to be the time
step of the discretization. We approximate the values
$u(\lambda,md,nh,u_0)$ by values $v_m^n$, $n\ge0$, $m=0,...,N+1$,
given by the following discretization scheme:
$$
\Delta v^{n+1}=Av^{n+1}+\underline{f}(\lambda,v^n),\ n\ge0,
\eqno(3.1)
$$
where
$$
v^n=\left(v_1^n,...,v_N^n\right)\in R^N, \
\underline{f}(\lambda,v)=\left(f(\lambda,v_1),...,f(\lambda,v_N)\right),
$$
$$
\Delta v^{n+1}=\frac{1}{h}\left(v^{n+1}-v^n\right),
\ (Av)_m=\frac{1}{d^2}\left(v_{m+1}-2v_m+v_{m-1}\right),
$$
and $v_0=v_{N+1}=0$. Scheme (3.1) generates a mapping
$$
\varphi(\lambda,\cdot):\ R^N\to R^N
\eqno(3.2)
$$
such that $v^{n+1}=\varphi(\lambda,v^n)$.

We assume everywhere that
$$
h\|A\|<1,
\eqno(3.3)
$$
where $\|A\|$ is the operator norm of the matrix $A$. Under
condition (3.3), the mapping (3.2) is given by
$$
\varphi(\lambda,v)=J^{-1}\left(v+h\underline{f}(\lambda,v)\right),
\eqno(3.4)
$$
where $J=E_N-hA$.

It is shown in [13] that if, for a fixed $\lambda$,
$$
f(\lambda,\cdot)\in C^1, \quad \left|\frac{\partial }{\partial
u}\,f(\lambda,u)\right|\le M, \quad {\rm and} \quad hM<1,
\eqno(3.5)
$$
then $\varphi(\lambda,v)$ is a diffeomorphism of the space $R^N$.
We also assume that inequalities (2.5) hold for $\lambda\in R$.

In this section, we pay the main attention to the case
$f(\lambda,u)=\lambda g(u)$, since in this case the sufficient
conditions of local identifiability are quite simple (we discuss
the general case later, in Remark 3.2).

Thus, let $f(\lambda,u)=\lambda g(u)$.

We fix $\lambda_0\in R$ and assume that conditions (3.5) are
satisfied for $(\lambda,u)\in\Lambda\times R$, where $\Lambda$ is
a neighborhood of $\lambda_0$.

{\bf Theorem 3.1.} {\it Assume that $f(\lambda,u)=\lambda g(u)$
and

{\rm (a)} all fixed points of the diffeomorphism
$\varphi(\lambda_0,\cdot)$ are hyperbolic;

{\rm (b)} if $g(0)=0$, then the fixed point $u=0$ of
$\varphi(\lambda_0,\cdot)$ is unstable.

Then there exists an open and dense subset ${\cal H}\subset R^N$
such that, for any $u_0\in{\cal H}$, scheme (3.1) is locally
identifiable at $\lambda_0$ via observations of the trajectory
$\{\varphi^n(\lambda_0,u_0):\ n\ge0\}$ in the following sense:
there exists a number $\varepsilon>0$ such that for any $\lambda$,
$0<|\lambda-\lambda_0|<\varepsilon$, and any $v_0\in R^N$, there
exists $n_0>0$ such that
$$
\varphi^n(\lambda_0,u_0)\ne\varphi^n(\lambda,v_0)
$$
for $n\ge n_0$.

If $g(0)\ne0$ and $\lambda_0\ne0$, then one may take ${\cal
H}=R^N$.}

{\it Proof.} It is shown in [13] that, for any $\lambda$, the
diffeomorphism $\varphi(\lambda,\cdot)$ has a global Lyapunov
function. Hence, any its trajectory tends to the set $F(\lambda)$
of fixed points of $\varphi(\lambda,\cdot)$.

Since fixed points of $\varphi(\lambda_0,\cdot)$ are hyperbolic, each of
them is isolated in $F(\lambda_0)$. It follows that, for any $u_0\in R^N$,
its trajectory $\varphi^n(\lambda_0,u_0)$ tends to a single fixed point.

Assume that $g(0)=0$ (the case $g(0)\ne0$ is more simple since in
this case $u=0$ is not a fixed point of
$\varphi(\lambda_0,\cdot)$).

Similarly to Theorem 2.1 (formula (2.10)), we define $\cal H$ by
the formula ${\cal H}=R^N\setminus W^S(0)$, where $W^S(0)$ is the
stable manifold of the hyperbolic unstable fixed point $u=0$ of
$\varphi(\lambda_0,\cdot)$. The set $\cal H$ is an open and dense
subset of $R^N$.

Fix $u_0\in{\cal H}$, and let
$$
\varphi^n(\lambda_0,u_0)
\mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits_{n\to\infty} w_0.
$$

It follows from formula (3.4) that $w\in R^N$ is a fixed point of
$\varphi(\lambda,\cdot)$ if and only if
$$
Aw+\lambda\underline{g}(w)=0.
\eqno(3.6)
$$

Consider the function
$$
\Phi(\lambda,w)=\varphi(\lambda,w)-w.
$$
This function is continuously differentiable in $\lambda$ and $w$. In
addition,
$$
\Phi(\lambda_0,w_0)=0
$$
since $w_0$ is a fixed point of $\varphi(\lambda_0,\cdot)$.

The point $w_0$ is a hyperbolic fixed point of
$\varphi(\lambda_0,\cdot)$, hence the eigenvalues $\lambda_j$ of
the Jacobi matrix
$$
\left.\frac{\partial \varphi(\lambda_0,w)}{\partial w}\right|_{w=w_0}
$$
satisfy the inequalities $|\lambda_j|\ne1$. It follows that
$\lambda_j\ne1$, and
$$
{\rm det}\left(\left. \frac{\partial \Phi(\lambda_0,w)}{\partial w}
\right|_{w=w_0}\right)
={\rm det}\left(\left.\frac{\partial \varphi(\lambda_0,w)}{\partial w}
\right|_{w=w_0}-E_N\right)\ne0.
$$

By the implicit function theorem, the equation
$$
\Phi(\lambda,w)=0
$$
has a unique (and continuously differentiable) solution $w(\lambda)$ in a
neighborhood of $\lambda_0$, and $w(\lambda_0)=w_0$.

Thus, we may differentiate equation (3.6) at $\lambda_0$; we
obtain the following equality:
$$
\left.A\frac{\partial w}{\partial
\lambda}\right|_{\lambda=\lambda_0}
+\underline{g}\left(w(\lambda_0)\right) +\lambda_0
D\left.\frac{\partial w}{\partial \lambda}
\right|_{\lambda=\lambda_0}=0,
\eqno(3.7)
$$
where
$$
D={\rm diag}\left(g'\left(w_{0,1}(\lambda_0)\right),...,
g'\left(w_{0,N}(\lambda_0)\right)\right)
$$
and
$$
w_0=\left(w_{0,1},...,w_{0,N}\right).
$$

Since $w_0\ne0$ and the matrix $A$ is nondegenerate, $Aw_0\ne0$.
It follows from equality (3.6) (with $\lambda=\lambda_0$) that
$\underline{g}(w_0)\ne0$.

Now equality (3.7) implies that
$$
\left.\frac{\partial w}{\partial
\lambda}\right|_{\lambda=\lambda_0}\ne0.
\eqno(3.8)
$$

It follows that there exists $\varepsilon>0$ such that, for
$0<|\lambda-\lambda_0|<\varepsilon$, the diffeomorphism
$\varphi(\lambda,\cdot)$ does not have fixed points coinciding with $w_0$.

Fix $\lambda$ such that $0<|\lambda-\lambda_0|<\varepsilon$ and
let $A(\lambda)$ be the global attractor of
$\varphi(\lambda,\cdot)$ (such an attractor exists under condition
(2.5), see [7]). Take arbitrary $v_0\in R^N$. For the
$\omega$-limit set $\omega(\lambda,v_0)$ of the trajectory
$\varphi^n(\lambda,v_0)$, the following inclusions hold:
$$
\omega(\lambda,v_0)\subset F(\lambda)\subset A(\lambda).
$$
$F(\lambda)$ is a closed subset of the compact set $A(\lambda)$, hence
$F(\lambda)$ is compact. It was shown above that
$$
w_0\not\in F(\lambda),
$$
hence
$$
{\rm dist}\left(w_0,\omega(\lambda,v_0)\right)>0.
\eqno(3.9)
$$

Relation (3.9) and the relations
$$
{\rm dist}\left(\varphi^n(\lambda,v_0),\omega(\lambda,v_0)\right)\to0,
\quad n\to\infty,
$$
and
$$
\varphi^n(\lambda_0,u_0)\to w_0, \quad n\to\infty,
$$
imply the statement of Theorem 3.1.

{\bf Remark 3.1.} Note that, in contrast to Sec.~2, in the case of
scheme (3.1) we do not have to refine the observations of
trajectories $\varphi^n(\lambda_0,u_0)$ and
$\varphi^n(\lambda,v_0)$.

{\bf Remark 3.2.} It is possible to apply a similar reasoning in
the general case where the nonlinearity in (2.1) has the form
$f(\lambda,u)$. Obviously, in this case the condition
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \lambda}\in C, \quad
\left.\frac{\partial }{\partial
\lambda}f(\lambda,u)\right|_{\lambda=\lambda_0}\ne0 \quad {\rm
for\ all} \quad u
\eqno(3.10)
$$
is sufficient.

Indeed, in this case equality (3.7) is replaced by the equality
$$
A\left.\frac{\partial w}{\partial \lambda}\right|_{\lambda=\lambda_0}
+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial \lambda}\, (\lambda_0,w_{0,1}),...,
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \lambda}\,(\lambda_0,w_{0,N})\right)+
$$
$$
+{\rm diag}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\,(\lambda_0,w_{0,1}),...,
\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}\,(\lambda_0,w_{0,N})\right)
\left.\frac{\partial w}{\partial \lambda}\right|_{\lambda=\lambda_0} =0.
$$

This equality and condition (3.10) imply that inequality (3.8)
holds. The rest of the proof is the same as in Theorem~3.1.

{\bf Remark 3.3.} For a fixed $\lambda_0$, the genericity of
condition (a) in Theorem~3.1 is established in [7].

{\bf Remark 3.4.} Theorem 3.1 generalizes the main result of [3],
established for the Chaffee\,--\,In\-fan\-te problem.


\section{Applications}

\hspace{10mm}Equations of the type (2.1) are widely used in
applications (it is enough to mention the famous
Kolmogorov\,--\,Pet\-rov\-ski\,--\,Pis\-ku\-nov equation [10]).

For new applications, let us mention the work [11] in which the
Landau\,--\,Kha\-lat\-ni\-kov equation is reduced to the
Chaffee\,--\,In\-fan\-te problem
$$
\eta_t=\eta_{xx}+\lambda\eta-\eta^3, \quad \eta(0)=\eta(\pi)=0.
\eqno(4.1)
$$

Equation (4.1) models the evolution of a binary alloy; the
parameter $\lambda$ is directly related to the temperature of the
alloy.

Of course, the results of this paper are of theoretical character;
they only give us conditions of parametric identifiability
(i.\,e., the possibility of parameter identification) and not an
algorithm of identification itself.

Nevertheless, it is interesting to apply the method of Sec.\,3 to
check the ``rate of divergence'' of solutions of scheme (3.1) for
different values of $\lambda$.

Below, we represent results of numerical simulation of Eq.\,(4.1)
for some values of $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda$.

We fix time step $h=0.01$, space step $d=\frac{\pi}{21}$ (so that
$N=20$), and the initial value $v^0=(v_1^0,...,v^0_{20})$ with
$v^0_{2i+1}=0$, $i=0,...,9$; $v^0_{2i}=1$, $i=1,...,10$.

The tables below show the number of steps at which the norm of the
difference between the solutions $\varphi^n(\lambda_0,v^0)$ and
$\varphi^n(\lambda,v^0)$ reaches the prescribed value $\Delta$.
The calculations are stopped if
$$
|\varphi^n(\lambda_0,v^0)-\varphi^n(\lambda,v^0)|<\Delta \quad
\textrm{for} \quad n\le 100\,000.
$$

In Table 1, $\lambda_0=1.4$, $\lambda=1.5$; in Table~2,
$\lambda_0=1.4$, $\lambda=1.6$.
