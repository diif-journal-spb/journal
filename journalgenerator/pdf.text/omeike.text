New results on the stability and boundedness
of solutions of certain third order nonlinear
vector differential equations

Abstract
We investigate in this paper, the asymptotic stability of the zero solution
and boundedness of all solutions of a certain third order nonlinear ordinary vec-
tor differential equation. Our results revise and improve those results obtained
by Tunc and Ates [Tunc C., Ates, M., Stability and boundedness results for so-
lutions of certain third order nonlinear vector differential equations,Nonlinear
Dynamics 45 (2006); 273-281].
Keywords: boundedness, differential equation of third order, Lyapunov func-
tion, stability

Recently, Tunc and Ates [11] considered the differential equation

that the Jacobian matrix J

and continuous. Hence the following theorems were proved.
In the case P  0, the following result was established.
Theorem A (Tunc and Ates[11]). In addition to the fundamental assump-
tions on F;B and H suppose that:
(i) there exists ann n-real continuous operatorA(X;Y ) for any vectorsX;Y

H(X) =H(Y ) +A(X;Y )(X Y ); (H(0) = 0);

ces A;B(t);

Then, the zero solution of system (1.2) is asymptotically stable.
In the case P6= 0, the following result was established.
Theorem B (Tunc and Ates[11]). Let all the conditions of Theorem A be
satis ed, and in addition we assume that there exist a  nite constant K > 0
and a non-negative and continuous function   =  (t) such that the vector P
satis es
kP (t;X;Y;Z)k  (t) + (t)(kXk +kYk +kZk);
where
Z
t
0
 (s)ds  K <1 for all t  0. Then the exists a constant D > 0
such that any solution (X(t);Y (t);Z(t)) of (1.2) determined by
X(0) =X
0
; Y (0) =Y
0
; Z(0) =Z
0
satis es
kXk D; kYk D; kZk D
for all t  0.
These are very interesting results obtained by the authors [11]. However,
these results contain certain conditions which are not necessary for the stability
and boundedness of (1.2). Our aim in this paper is to further study the stability
(when P  0) and boundedness (when P6= 0) of solutions of Eq. (1.1). In the
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal/ 28Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2008
next section, we establish criteria for the stability of the zero solution of Eq.
(1.1) when P  0, and the boundedness of solutions of Eq. (1.1) when P6= 0,
which extend and improve TheoremsA andB,respectively. An effective method
for studying the stability and boundedness of nonlinear differential equations is
the second method of Lyapunov (See [1-11]).

from the vectorH(X) in (1.1). Our  rst theorem is given for the case in which

(i) The matrices F (X;Y;Z);B(t);

mute pairwise. The eigenvalues

Then, the zero solution of system (1.2) is asymptotically stable.
In the case P6= 0 we have the following result.
Theorem 2. Let all the conditions of Theorem 1 be satis ed, and in addition
we assume that there exists a  nite constant K > 0 and a non-negative and
continuous function   = (t) such that the vector P satis es
kP (t;X;Y;Z)k  (t) + (t)(kXk +kYk +kZk); (2:5)

where
Z

 (s)ds  K <1 for all t  0. Then there exists a constant D > 0
such that any solution (X(t);Y (t);Z(t)) of (1.2) determined by
X(0) =X
0
; Y (0) =Y
0
; Z(0) =Z
0
satis es
kX(t)k D; kY (t)k D; kZ(t)k D
for all t  0.
3. Some Preliminaries
The following results will be basic to the proofs of Theorems 1 and 2. We
do not give the proofs since they are found in [1-7,9,10,11].
Lemma 1. Let D be a real symmetric n n matrix, then for any X in IR
n

we have

where  
d
;  
d
are the least and greatest eigenvalues of D, respectively.
Lemma 2. Let Q;D be any two real n n commuting symmetric matrices.
Then
(i) The eigenvalues 
i
(QD)(i = 1; 2;    ;n) of the product matrixQD are real
and satisfy

where

4. The Function V

Our main tool in the proof of our result is the Lyapunov function V =

The following result is immediate from (4.3).
Lemma 3. Assume that all the hypotheses on matrices F (X;Y;Z); B(t) and
vector H(X) in Theorems 1 and 2 are satis ed. Then there exists a positive
constant

such that

Proof of Lemma 3. We shall make use of the result:

H(

with respect to

and then using the fact that H(0) = 0.
By (4.5), we can rewrite (4.3) thus,

By (2.5) and (4.2), we have that there is a constant

Hence we can  nd a positive number

small enough such that (4.4) holds.
This completes the proof of Lemma 3.
The following lemma is instrumental in the proof of the next result.

Proof of Theorem 2. Consider the functionV de ned by (4.1). Then, under
the assumptions of Theorem 2 the conclusion of Lemma 3 can be obtained, that
is,
V

(kXk

and since P (t;X;Y;Z)6= 0, then the conclusion of Lemma 5 can be revised as

Next, by noting the assumption of Theorem 2 on P (t;X;Y;Z) and using
Schwarz's inequality, we obtain
_ v   (ff kXk +

kYk +kZk) kP (t;X;Y;Z)k
  (ff kXk +

kYk +kZk)  ( (t) + (t)(kXk +jjYk +kZk))

(kXk +kYk +kZk)  ( (t) + (t)(kXk +jjYk +kZk))
where

Hence, by using the inequalities
kXk  1 +kXk
2
; kYk  1 +kYk

; kZk  1 +kZk
2
and (4.8), we obtain
_ v

 (t)v; (4:9)
where

and

Integrating both sides of (4.9) from 0 to t(t  0), leads to the inequality

The proof of the theorem is now complete.
5. Remarks
(i). Clearly, Theorems 1 and 2 are improvement and extension of Theorems
A and B respectively. Particularly, from Theorems 1 and 2, we see that
hypothesis (i) of Theorems A and B is not necessary sinceH(X) is assumed
differentiable.
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal/ 35Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2008
(ii). Also, from Theorems 1 and 2, it is clear that we do not need any symmetric
matrix A (as assumed in Theorems A and B), thus the condition 0  
 
i
(F (X;Y;Z) A) 
p
 
2
; (i = 1; 2;:::;n); is not necessary.
