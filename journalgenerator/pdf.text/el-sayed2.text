Abstract
In this paper we are concerned with a stochastic differential equation with non-
local condition. We study the existence of a unique mean square continuous
solution. The continuous dependencies of the solution with respect to the ran-
dom initial value and deterministic coe cients of the nonlocal condition are
shown. A stochastic differential equation with an integral condition is consid-
ered as well.
Keywords: Nonlocal condition, unique mean square solution, continuous depen-
dence, random data, nonlocal coe cients, integral condition.
1 Introduction
Problems with nonlocal conditions have been extensively studied by several
authors in the last decades for ordinary differential equations. The reader is re-
ferred to ([3]-[4]) and ([6]-[8]), and references therein. Also problems of stochas-
tic differential equations have been extensively studied by several authors in the
last decades, especially those contain the noisy term of Brownian motionW (t).Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2017
The reader is referred to ([1]-[2]) and ([10]-[17]) and references therein.
Here we are concerned with the stochastic differential equation

with the nonlocal random initial condition

where X

is a second order random variable independent of the Brownian mo-
tion (or Wiener process) W (t) and a
k
are positive real numbers.
The existence of a unique mean square continuous solution will be studied. The
continuous dependencies with respect to random initial valueX
0
and determin-
istic coe cients of the nonlocal condition a

will be established. The problem
(1) with the mean square Riemann-Stieltjes integral condition

will be considered.
2 Integral representation
Let I = [0;T ], (
;F;P ) be a  xed probability space, where 
 is a sample
space, F is a   algebra and P is a probability measure. We denote by L

the Banach space of random variables X : 
!R such that

Let X(t;!) =fX(t);t2I;!2 
g be a second order stochastic process, i.e.,
E(X

(t))<1;t2I:
Now let C = C(I;L

(

order stochastic processes with the norm

Throughout the paper we assume that the following assumptions hold

(i) The function f : [0;T ] L

(ii) There exists an integrable deterministic function k : [0;T ]!R

3 Existence and uniqueness
For the existence of a unique solution X2 C of the problem (1)-(2), we have
the following theorem.
Theorem 1 Let the assumptions (i)-(iii) be satis ed. If 2m < 1, then the
problem (1)-(2) has a unique solution X2C.

Now if 2m< 1, then the operator F :C!C is contraction.
Then by Banach's  xed point theorem [2], there exists a unique solutionX2C

Let v : [0;T ]! [0;T ] be nondecreasing function such that
a

);  
k
2 (t
k 1
;t
k

where (0< t

< t

<::::<T ):
Then, the nonlocal condition (2) will be in the form
X(0) +
n
X
k=1
X( 
k
)(v(t
k
) v(t
k 1
)) =X
0
:
From the mean square continuity of the solution of the nonlocal problem (1)-(2),
we obtain from [15]

X(

That is, the nonlocal conditions (2) is transformed to the mean square Riemann-
Stieltjes integral condition
X(0) +

Z

X(s)dg(s) =X

;
Now, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 1 Let the assumptions (i)-(iii) be satis ed, then the random differ-
ential equation (1) with the nonlocal integral condition (3) has a unique solution
given by the solution of
