Abstract. In this paper, we consider boundary control problem for a fourth order pseudo-parabolic 
equation with Dirichlet conditions in the quadratic domain. A control function is given at the 
boundary of the considered domain. To achieve the average temperature in the domain, it is 
required to find a control function. Using the Fourier method, the control problem is reduced to the 
Volterra integral equation of the second type. The existence of the control function is proved using 
the method of successive approximation. 
 
Keywords: initial-boundary problem; fourth order pseudo-parabolic equation; Volterra integral 
equation; admissible control. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
It is known that in recent years, due to the increasing interest in physics and mathematics, the boundary 
problems related to pseudo-parabolic equations were widely studied. For this purpose, various boundary 
problems for parabolic and pseudo-parabolic equations have been widely studied by many researchers. 
It is well known that fourth-order pseudo-parabolic equations describe a variety of important physical 
processes, such as heat conduction in materials, electric signals in a nonlinear telegraph line with nonlinear 
damping, viscous flow in materials with memory [1], vibration of a nonlinear elastic rod with viscosity [2], 
nonlinear bidirectional shallow water waves [3], the velocity evolution of ionacoustic waves in a 
collisionless plasma when an ion viscosity is invoked [4], and so on. 
The boundary control of a linear pseudo-parabolic equation and compare the results to those of 
parabolic equations was studied in [5]. The stability, uniqueness, and existence of solutions of some Differential equations and control processes, N. 2, 2025

classical problems for the considered equation are studied in [6]. In [7], the point control problems for 
linear pseudo-parabolic and parabolic type equations are considered. 
The optimal control problem for the parabolic type equations was studied by Fattorini and Friedman 
[8, 9]. Control problems for the infinite-dimensional case were studied by Egorov [10], who generalized 
Pontryagin’s maximum principle to a class of equations in Banach space, and the proof of a bang-bang 
principle was shown in the particular conditions. 
The boundary control problem for a parabolic equation with a piecewise smooth boundary in an 
n  dimensional domain was studied in [11] and an estimate for the minimum time required to reach a 
given average temperature was found. In [12], the considered the heat conduction equation with the Robin 
boundary condition and developed a mathematical model of the process of heating a cylindrical domain. 
Boundary control problems for fourth-order parabolic equations were studied in [13,14]. 
The works [15] examine control problems for parabolic equations in bounded two-dimensional 
domain. In these articles, an estimate was found for the minimum time required to heat a bounded domain 
to an estimate average temperature. The existence of control function is proved by Laplace transform 
method. Similar control problems were examined in the one-dimensional domain in [16-18]. 
Basic information on optimal control problems is given in detail in monographs by Lions and Fursikov 
[19, 20]. Boundary control problems for linear pseudo-parabolic type equations were studied in works [21-
23], and it was proved that there is a control function for heating the domain to the average temperature. 
For the fourth order nonlinear pseudo-parabolic equation, there are also some results about initial 
boundary value problem and Cauchy problem, especially on the global existence, nonexistence and 
asymptotic behavior of the solutions [24-26]. 
In 1978, Bakiyevich and Shadrin [24] considered the following problem  
 
= ( , ), , >0,
( ,0)= ( ), ,

where ,0   , 0   are constants. They showed that the solutions of this problem are expressed 
through the sum of convolutions of functions () x  and ( , ) f x t with corresponding fundamental 
solutions of the problem. In 2009, Khudaverdiyev and Farhadova [25] discussed the following 
fourth order semilinear pseudo-parabolic equation  
 
= ( , , , , , ), 0 1, 0 < ,
t xxt xxxx x xx xxx
u u u f x t u u u u x t T          
 
 
where >0  is a fixed number. They proved the existence in large theorem for generalized solution 
by means of Schauder stronger fixed point principle. Zhao and Xuan [26] studied the following 
 
( ) =0, , >0.
t xx xxt xxxx x
u u u u f u x R t        
 
 
  
They obtained the existence and convergence behavior of the global smooth solutions. 
In this work, we considered the problem of boundary control for the fourth-order pseudo-parabolic 
equation with Dirichlet conditions in the quadratic domain. For this, the control problem was first reduced 
to the Volterra integral equation of the second kind, and the continuity of the integral in the given domain 
was shown. As a result, the existence of the control function was proved using the method of successive 
approximation.

In this section, we consider the reduction of the control problem to a Volterra integral equation of the 
second kind.
