Abstract 
 
Using a new permeability - defined for anisotropic permanent magnets - we will  demonstrate the refraction theorems of the three–
dimensional (3D) magnetic field lines at the separation surface of two anisotropic materials with permanent magnetization (two permanent 
magnets), which have random magnetization main directions. Also, the general forms of demonstrated theorems are particularized for 
diverse concrete cases and an example is given to illustrate the new defined quantities. 
Keywords: nonlinear and anisotropic permanent magnets, another permeability, random magnetization, refraction theorems 
1. INTRODUCTION 
For materials with permanent magnetization, the relation law between flux density B, magnetic field intensity H and 
magnetization M [1,2] it‟s 
 
 B = µ
0
 
 
H + µ
0
 
 
M
τ
 + µ
0
 
 
M
p
 , (1) 
 
where µ
0  
is the vacuum permeability. The separation in temporary ( M
τ 
) and permanent (M
p
) components of magnetization 
M is unique only if M
p
 is independent of H and M
τ
 – depending on H – is null at the same time with H. The value of B for 
H = 0 represents the remanent flux density ( B
r
 ), that is 
 
 B
r
 = B|
H=0
 = µ
0
 M
p
 . (2) 
 
From relation (1) it follows that for materials with M
p
 ≠ 0 ( permanent magnets ), the “classical” tensor of magnetic 
permeability [µ] (B = [µ]H ) is not univocally determined by material, because M
p
 could have more values at the same Differential Equations and Control Processes, №1, 2010

material (for diverse minor cycles of hysteresis which are possible, B
r
 = µ
0
 M
p
 can have more values). In this context it is 
useful to define another permeability for permanent magnets, which helps overcome the above-mentioned difficulty. 
2. ANOTHER PERMEABILITY FOR ANISOTROPIC PERMANENT MAGNETS 
The temporary magnetization value of anisotropic materials is depending on the direction of magnetic field, and the 
temporary magnetization low is  
 
 M
τ
 = [χ]
m
 H , (3) 
 
were, for the nonlinear materials, the components of magnetic susceptivity tensor [χ]
m
 are depending on the magnetic field 
intensity components. Consequently, in case on the nonlinear anisotropic permanent magnets, rel. (1) becomes 
 
 B = µ
0
 ( [1] + [χ]
m
 ) H + B
r
 , (4) 
 
were, the tensor‟s components are nonlinear functions depending on the components of H. 
If we introduce the calculation quantity 
 
 B
p
 = B – B
r
 = B - µ
0
 M
p
 , (5) 
 
rel.(4) becomes 
 
 B
p
 = µ
0
 ( [1] + [χ]
m
 ) H. (6) 
 
From rel. (4, 5, 6), the relative [µ
rp
] and absolute [µ
p
] calculation tensors permeability of permanent magnets are 
defined with these relations : 
 
 [µ
rp
] = ( [1]+[χ]
m
 );  [µ
p
] = µ
0
 [µ
rp
]. (7) 
 
Introducing B
p
 vector (rel.5) and the new permeability [µ
p
] (rel.7), for permanent magnets we obtain relation 
 
 B
p
 = [µ
p
] H , (8) 
 
which, formally, is similarly with the “classical” relation B = [µ] H , written for the materials without permanent 
magnetization. For isotropic materials, even they are with permanent magnetization (isotropic permanent magnets), rel. (8) 
becomes B
p
 = µ
p
 H , which is showing that the lines spectra of B
p
 and H are the same in this case. We known that for 
permanent magnets (even isotropic one) the spectra lines of B and H are different [1, 4]. 
Since the definition relation of [µ
p
] contain also permanent magnetization M
p
, using B
p
 and [µ
p
], we have 
advantageously taken into account the non-linearity of the demagnetization curves of permanent magnets, for any minor 
hysteresis cycle could be. 
It‟s known that following the magnetization main directions [2], tensor [χ]
m
 has only three components. If we note 
these three directions (generally, non-rectangular) with x , y , z index, from rel. (4) results 
 
 B
ν
 = µ
0
 ( 1+χ
mν 
) H
ν
 + B
rν
 ; ν = x , y , or  z , (9) 
 
and all three components of tensor [µ
rp
] are 
 
 µ
rpν
=( B
ν
 - B
rν
 )/µ
0
 H
ν
 = B
pν
 /µ
0
 H
ν
; ν = x, y, z. (10) 
 
If we take into account that for the point of function of a permanent magnet B < B
r
 ( respectively B
ν
 < B
rν
 ) and H < 
0 ( the demagnetization curve is in the second quadrant of the hysterezis cycle ), results that the components of tensor [μ
rp
] 
are positive and scalar quantities. It‟s interesting to specify if we known all the three hysteresis cycles following the 
magnetization main axes, we should determine the nonlinear functions μ
rpν
(H
ν
). For these three main directions x, y, z, the 
nonlinear function plots will have similar forms, but they will be quantitative different, as like as the demagnetization 
curves following the main three directions of the anisotropic magnet are different between them. 
The defining relative permeability of permanent magnets it‟s an useful operation. For example, since the system is 
generally nonlinear, the numerical solution for magnetic field problem in permanent magnets it‟s obtained with an iterative 
process ( see [5] for isotropic materials ). The parameter after which the convergence of the problem is followed could be 
the relative permeability, defined with rel. (7), respectively rel. (10). It‟s evident that for anisotropic materials the 
convergence of the calculation is made with components of tensors [μ
p
], respectively [μ
rp
]. Through this defined Differential Equations and Control Processes, №1, 2010

calculation quantity we take univocally and advantageously into account the nonlinearity of the demagnetization curves, 
indifferently if we talk about the major or minor demagnetization curves (for any permanent magnetization M
p
).  
3. THE REFRACTION THEOREMS 
We consider two different permanent magnets 1 and 2, at rest, separate by smooth surface S
12
 (Fig. 1). The general 
demonstration is referring to the refraction of the magnetic field lines of H and of calculation flux density B
p
 (defined by 
rel. 5), for 3D field in anisotropic permanent magnets, having random magnetization main directions. For magnet 1 these 
directions are noted with (x
1
, y
1
, z
1
) and unit vectors i
1
, j
1
, k
1
, and for magnet 2 are noted with (x
2
, y
2
, z
2
,) and unit vectors i
2
, 
j
2
, k
2
. These axes system (after magnetization main directions of the two permanent magnets) are, generally, non-
rectangular. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In order to utterance of normal and tangent components of the magnetic field state quantities at the separation surface 
S
12
, for both media we attach a rectangular axes system (n, t, h) with unit vectors n, t, and h. Unit vector n is perpendicular 
on S
12
 in point O, unit vector t is tangent on S
12
 in point O and situated in the plane of H vectors, and unit vector k is 
orthogonal on the plane determined by n and t. 
It‟s known that in permanent magnets the spectra lines of flux density B, of magnetic field intensity H and of 
magnetization M
p
 are different, both for anisotropic media and for isotropic media.  
In order to write the projections on axes of quantities B
p
, H and M
p
, we introduce the angles: 
- the angles between B
p1

p2
 and the axes of system (n, t, h) :

Because the 3D systems (n, t, h) and (x
λ
, y
λ
, z
λ
), with λ = 1 or 2, generally have a random position, the angles “φ” 
must be defined. For example: α
1n
=

 (B
p1

1x
 =

 (B
p1

); because B
p1
, n and i
1
 are not in the same plane, the angle 
φ
1nx
 = 
)
 (n , i
1
) can‟t obtain from a combination between the angles α
1n
 and α
1x
. Also, it is remark that between the angles 
of B
p
, H and M
p
 vectors with the normal, respectively with the tangent directions, the sum is not 90
0
, because it‟s 3D 
system. Namely, α
λn
 + α
λt
 ≠ 90
0
, because B
p1
, n and t generally are not in the same plane. Similarly, β
λn
 + β
λt
 ≠ 90
0
 and γ
λn
 + 
γ
λt
 ≠ 90
0
 (λ = 1, 2). 
The normal components of magnetic flux density B of the separation surface S
12
 it‟s preserved (the local form of 
magnetic flux law), i.e.  
 
 B
1n
 = B
2n
 = B
n
 . (19) 
 
Considering that the separation surface (at rest) is not containing a current skin-deep repartition, result the 
conservation of the tangent components of H (the local form of magnetic circuit law):  
 
 H
1t
 = H
2t
 = H
t
 . (20) 
 
For 3D field in anisotropic media with permanent magnetization, from rel. (6, 7) considering for both media, results  
 B
pλ
 = [μ
pλ
] H
λ
 ;    λ = 1, 2 , (21) 
 
where [ μ
pλ
 ] = [ μ
pλx
   μ
pλy
   μ
pλz
 ] are the tensors for calculation absolute permeability. 
If we emphasize the components following the magnetization main directions (see also rel. (10), where μ
0 
μ
rpν
 = μ
pν
 ), 
rel. (21) becomes 
 
 B
pλν
 = μ
pλν
H
λν
  ; λ = 1, 2  ; ν = x, y, z . (22) 
 
We can see that between B
p
 and H components could be written relations like (22) only following the magnetization 
main directions (x
λ
, y
λ
, z
λ
), but not following rectangular directions (n, t, h) [1, 2, 5].  
With the projections following the magnetization main directions, in both media, we can write these relations:  
 
     B
pλ
 = B

 ,                    (23) 
 
where λ = 1, 2. Because it is the general case (anisotropic permanent magnets having random magnetization main 
directions), we remark that [3] : B

If we write the vectors B

could write the relations :

 are positive or negative 
depending on the concrete laying of vectors B

 in comparison with the axes system.  
Consequently, the normal components of magnetic field intensity H (components which are not conserved) are 
respecting rel.(40); this relation will be named the theorem of the 3D magnetic field intensity lines refraction, in anisotropic 
permanent magnets with random magnetization main directions. 
3.2. The refraction theorem of calculation flux density lines B

The tangent component of H in medium 1 could be written as a sum of projections on tangent direction of the three 
components (H
1x
, H
1y,
 H
1z 
) following the magnetization main directions: 
 
 H
1t
 = H
1xt
 + H
1yt
 + H
1zt
 . (41) 
 
Regarding the meaning of H
1xt 
, H
1yt
 and H
1zt 
, as well as rel.(22), expression (41) becomes 
 
 H
1t
 = H

Alike, for the tangent component of H from medium 2 we can write 
 
 H
2t
 = H

 + H

 = H

 . (43) 
 
By replacing (42) and (43) in (20) we can write 
 
 [(B

 /μ
p1x 
) cos φ
1tx
 - (B
p2x
 /μ

 - (B

 ]=0. (44) 
 
If we put into evidence the projections on the tangent of the components following magnetization main axes for B
pλ
  
(λ = 1, 2), from rel.(44) results 
 
 (B

)=0,  (45) 
 
where B
pλνt
 = B
pλν
 cos φ
λtν
 , with λ = 1, 2 and ν = x, y, z. Components B
pλνt
 and H
λνt
 are positive or negative depending on the 
concrete laying of vectors B
pλ
 and H
λ
 in comparison with the axes systems. 
Consequently, the tangent components of calculation flux density B
p
 are respecting relation (45); this relation will be 
named the theorem of 3D refraction of calculation magnetic flux density B
p
 lines, in anisotropic permanent magnets with 
random magnetization main directions. We should remark that the theorem (45) has a simple form than the refraction 
theorem of magnetic flux density lines, which we had been considered the “classical” quantities B and [μ] (see [4], rel. 27).  
4. PARTICULAR CASES OF THE REFRACTION THEOREMS 
4.1.  3D fields in isotropic permanent magnets 
For isotropic media, the calculation permeability in two materials is: 
 
 μ
p1x = 
μ
p1y = 
μ
p1z= 
μ
p1
 ;  μ
p2x = 
μ
p2y = 
μ
p2z = 
μ
p2
 . (46) 
 
If we take into account rel.(46), theorem (40) for refraction of magnetic field intensity lines becomes 
 
 μ
p1
(H
1xn
 + H
1yn
 + H
1zn
) - μ
p2
( H
2xn
 + H
2yn
 + H
2zn
 ) +   
 +μ
0
 [( M
p1xn
 + M
p1yn
 + M
p1zn
 ) – ( M
p2xn
 + M
p2yn
 + M
p2zn
 )] = 0 . (47) 
 
Considering the significations from theorem (40), expression (47) may be written shortly in this way : 
 
 μ
p1
 H
1n
 = μ
p2
 H
2n
 – μ
0
 ( M
p1n
 – M
p2n
 ) . (48) 
 Differential Equations and Control Processes, №1, 2010

In case of isotropic permanent magnets, rel. (5) and (7), become B
pλ
 = B
λ
 – μ
0
 M
pλ
 = μ
pλ
 H
λ
  (λ = 1, 2) . In this case, 
we can write the relations B
pλn
 = μ
pλ
 H
λn
 = B
λn
 – μ
0
 M
pλn
 or B
λn
 = μ
pλ
 H
λn
 + μ
0
 M
pλn
  (λ = 1, 2). Consequently, after a 
regrouping of the terms in rel. (48), we track down rel. (19), as we expect.  
Alike, taking into account rel. (46), theorem (45) for refraction of calculation flux density lines becomes 
 
 ( B
p1xt
 + B
p1yt
 + B
p1zt
 )/μ
p1
 – ( B
p2xt
 + B
p2yt
 + B
p2zt
 )/μ
p2
 = 0 . (49) 
 
Considering the significations from theorem (45), expression (49) may be written shortly: 
 
 B
p1t
 / μ
p1
 = B
p2t
 / μ
p2
 . (50) 
 
Rel. (48) and (50) are the theorem of refraction for H, respectively B
p
, in 3D field for isotropic permanent magnets. 
We can remark that, for the tangent components of B
p
, theorem (50) for permanent magnets has a similarly form (but 
another content) with “classical” theorem of refraction in materials without permanent magnetization. 
For isotropic permanent magnets, we can write rel. B
pλ
 = μ
pλ
 H
λ
  (λ = 1, 2). That means, for this case, vectorial 
quantity B
p
, defined in rel.(5), is refracting in the same way as magnetic field intensity H, or B
p
 and H have the same 
direction. In permanent magnets, field lines of “classical” B and field line of H, generally are different [1, 2, 3]. Also, 
theorem (50) has more simple form than “classical” treatment, with B and H ( s. [4], rel. 32). So, the introduction of new 
quantities B
p
 and [μ
p
] are helping us to express the refraction theorem in a more simple form. 
4.2.  3D fields in isotropic permanent media without permanent magnetization 
In this case, from rel.(5) we obtain B
p
 = B (for M
p
 = 0 ). Also, from rel.(7), for isotropic media we can write μ
p
 = B
p
 
/ H = B / H . So μ
p
 = μ, which means that the calculation permeability is identical with the “classical” permeability, if the 
media is without permanent magnetization.  
Particularizing rel.(48) and (59) for this case and taking into account of the previous observations, results 
 
 μ
p1
 / μ
p2
 = B
p1t
 / B
p2t
 = H
2n
 / H
1n
 = μ
1
/μ
2
 = B
1t
 / B
2t
 ,  (51) 
 
that is the “classical” form of the refraction theorem for the magnetic field lines. B
p
 and H have the same field lines 
because is an isotropic material. But B
p
 and B are identical (because M
p
 = 0), that means B and H have the same field lines. 
4.3.  2D fields in isotropic media with permanent magnetization 
For 2D field, vectors B
p
 , H and M
p
 have not the components after z axe. Rel.(48) and (50) are valid in this case, but 
z components absent from rel.(47) and (49). In this case α
λn
 + α
λt
 = 90
0
 and β
λn
 + β
λt
 = 90
0
 . If we represent B
pλ
 and H
λ
 
vectors, we obtain “classical” representation, but B replace with B
p
 (Fig. 2). Because are isotropic media, B
p
 and H have 
the same lines spectra, therefore α
λn
 = β
λn
 and α
λt
= β
λt
 (λ = 1, 2). We remark that vectors B and H have not the same lines 
spectra, because M
p
≠0.

Because are isotropic media, B
p
 and H have the same lines spectra, therefore α
λn
 = β
λn
 and α
λt
= β
λt
 (λ = 1, 2). We 
remark that vectors B and H have not the same lines spectra, because M

 (λ = 1, 2). With this, taking into account the 
“classical” representation for 2D fields refraction in isotropic media without permanent magnetization [1, 2], we can 
complete rel.(51), finding again the “classical” relations: 
 
 μ

.  (52) 
 
That is the “classical” form of the refraction theorem for the magnetic field lines in isotropic media, without permanent 
magnetization, when B and H have the same lines spectra.  
It‟s easy to remark that, from general expression of refraction theorems of B
p
 and H  or from the particular forms 
already mentioned, we can obtain also other particular forms. Such cases are possible when one of the media has permanent 
magnetization and the other one does not (for example: permanent magnet – air gap, permanent magnet – common 
ferromagnetic material), when the permanent magnetization vectors have particular orientation, when the main directions of 
magnetization have particular orientation and so on.  
5. EXAMPLES FOR THE FUNCTIONS B
p
(H) AND µ
rp
(H) 
If the hysteresis cycle for the material of permanent magnets is known, we can determine the diagram of nonlinear 
function B
p
(H). After that, we have deduced nonlinear function µ
rp
(H) (or µ
p
(H)) . For an anisotropic permanent magnet, 
it„s necessary to known the hysteresis cycles after main directions of magnetization. In this case we can determine the 
diagrams of nonlinear function B
pν 
(H) and µ
rpν 
(H), with ν = x, y, z. 
For example, in Fig.3 nonlinear functions B
p
(H) and µ
rp
(H) are presented, for ALNICO 13/5, considering the major 
curve of demagnetization and isotropic material. 
 
 
 
 
6. CONCLUSIONS 
The introduction of permeability [µ
p
] for permanent magnets and calculation flux density B
p 
 - as we specify at par.2 
– it‟s useful operation because the theorems of refraction have more simple form. Also, the solution of field problem in 
nonlinear and anisotropic systems with permanent magnets it could be done in an advantageous way.

For anisotropic media with random magnetization main directions and also with permanent magnetization, the 
refraction theorems for 3D field are given by rel.(40) (for magnetic field intensity H ), respectively rel. (45) (for calculation 
flux density B
p
). Starting from these general forms of the theorems, some particular forms have been deduced, which could 
be necessary for solve magnetic field problem in system with permanent magnets. 
We can also remark that the similar theorems could be demonstrated for the electrical field lines refraction in media 
having permanent polarization.
