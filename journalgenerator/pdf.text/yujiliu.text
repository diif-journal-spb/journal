Abstract. By applying Leggett-Williams  xed-point theorem in cones in
Banach spaces, we obtain existence results of at least three bounded positive
solutions for a functional differential equation with p-Laplacian.
Keywords and phrases. Second order functional differential equation on
half line; bounded positive solution.

1 Introduction
Recently an increasing interest has been observed in investigating the oscilla-
tions of solutions of second order differential equations on half line.
For example, Kamenev [2], Philos [3] and Yang [4] dealt with the oscilla-
tory behavior of second order differential equations. Indeed, they extensively
investigated the oscillation of the following second order differential equations
without or with damping
(r(t)x
0
(t))
0
+p(t)x(t) = 0:
Several authors including Li and Yeh [5], Hsu and Yeh [6], Wong and Agar-
wal [7] have investigated the oscillation criteria of second order half-linear dif-
ferential equations of the form
(r(t)jx
0
(t)j
p 2
x
0
(t))
0
+p(t)jx(t)j
p 2
x(t) = 0:
Takasi and Yoshida [8] considered the oscillation of the following second order
quasilinear differential equation
(r(t)jx
0
(t)j
p 2
x
0
(t))
0
+p(t)jx(t)j
q 2
x(t) = 0:
In recent papers [10-12], by comparing with the oscillatory behavior of a
certain associated linear second-order differential equation, the authors stud-
ied the oscillatory properties of solutions of the following nonlinear differential
equation
(r(t) (x
0
(t)))
0
+c(t) (x(t)) = 0;
where  (x) =jxj
p 2
x with p> 1.
However, the existence of multiple positive solutions of above mentioned
equations have received much less attention.
In this paper, we consider the following functional differential equation with
p-Laplacian on half line
(
[p(t) (x
0
(t))]

The purpose of this paper is to establish existence results for at least three
bounded positive solutions of equation (1) by applying  xed point theorem in
cones in Banach spaces. Based on the results in this paper, the existence of
three bounded positive solutions of the equation
[p(t) (x
0
(t))]
0
+f(t;x(t)) = 0
subjected to the initial condition
x(t) = (t); t2 [ r; 0]
is established.
We call a function x : [ r; +1)!R is a positive solution of equation (1)
if x satis es equation
[p(t) (x
0
(t))]
0
+q(t)f(t;x(t);x( (t)) = 0; t2 (0; +1)
and the initial conditions
x(t) = (t); t2 [ r; 0]
and x(t)> 0 for all t> 0.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the main result and an
example to illustrate the main result are presented in Section 2. The proof of
the main result is given in Section 3.

3 Proofs of Theorem 2.1
In this section, we  rst present some background de nitions in Banach spaces
and then theorem 2.1 is proved.
As usual, letX be a semi-ordered real Banach space. The nonempty convex
closed subsetP ofX is called a cone inX ifax2P andx+y2P for allx;y2P
and a  0, and x2 X and x2 X imply x = 0. A map : P! [0; +1) is
a nonnegative continuous concave ( or convex ) functional map provided is
nonnegative, continuous and satis es
 (tx + (1 t)y)  ( or   ) t (x) + (1 t) (y) for all x;y2P;t2 [0; 1]:
An operator T ;X! X is completely continuous if it is continuous and maps
bounded sets into pre-compact sets.

Let X be a Banach space, P be a cone of X, :P!P be a nonnegative
convex continuous functional. Denote the sets by
P

c
=fx2P :jjxjj cg
and
P ( ;b;d) =fx2P : (x) b;jjxjj dg:
Theorem 3.1[1]. Suppose that X is a Banach space and P is a cone of
X. Let T : P

be a completely continuous operator and let be a
nonnegative continuous concave functional on P such that (y) jjyjj for all
y2P

(C1) fy2P ( ;b;d)j (y)>bg6=; and (Ty)>b for y2P ( ;b;d);
(C2) jjTyjj<a forjjyjj a;
(C3) (Ty)>b for y2P ( ;b;c) withjjTyjj>d.
Then T has at least three  xed points y

We call x  y for x;y2 X if x(t)  y(t) for all t2 [0; +1). Since x2 X
implies that there exists the limit lim

x(t). Then lim

Proof. Since x2 X, we get that lim

x

(t) = 0 and x is bounded.
Sincef : [0; +1)  [0; +1) R! [0; +1) is an S-Carath  eodory function, we
have
R

f(u;x(u);x( (u)))du< +1. Integrating (1) from t to +1, We get

The proof is completed.
Lemma 3.2. Suppose that x2 X is a solution of equation (1). Then
x
0
(t)  0 for all t2 [0; +1) and x(t) is positive and concave on (0; +1).
Proof. First, we prove that x
0
is positive on [0; +1). Since x2 X is a
solution of (1), we get from Lemma 3.1 thatx
0
(+1) = 0. Sincef is nonnegative,
we gat that [p(t) (x
0
(t))]
0
  0 for all t2 [0; +1). Then
p(+1) (x
0
(+1)) p(t) (x
0
(t))  0; t2 [0; +1):
It follows that p(t) (x
0
(t))  0. Then x
0
(t)  0 for all t2 [0; +1).
Second, we prove that x
0
(t) is decreasing on [0; +1). For t2 [0; +1), let
 (t) =

Hence x

Finally, we prove that x is positive on [0; +1). From above discussion, we
get that x
0
(t)  0 and x
0
(t) is decreasing on [0; +1). Then x(0) = 0 implies
that x(t)> 0 on (0; +1). We get that x(t) is positive on (0; +1). The proof
is completed.

Proof. The proofs of (i) and (iii) are simple and are omitted.
For x2P , by the de nition of T , we know that Tx is de ned on [0; +1).
It follows from Lemma 3.1 and 3.2 that Tx is increasing, concave and positive
on [0; +1). It is easy to see that the function (Tx)(t)=(1 +t) achieves its
maximum at [0; +1), then

So T is equiconvergent at in nity. By using Lemma 3.4, we obtain that T is
pre-compact, that is, T is a compact operator. Above all T : P! P is com-
pletely continuous. The proof is completed.

a nonnegative convex continuous functional on the cone P . (y) jjyjj for all
y2P . For x2P , it follows from Lemma 3.3 that TP P . From Lemma 3.5,
T :P!P is completely continuous.
