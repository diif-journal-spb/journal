Abstract
In this article,we will show how we can apply complex inversion formula for the inversion of
theL
2
-transform and also express some applications of the L
2
-transform for solving of singu-
lar integral equation (SIEs) with trigonometric kernel and system of partial fractional differential
equations(PFDEs).

1 Introduction
The Laplace-type integral transform called theL
2
-transform was introduced by Yurekli and
Sadek [9] and denoted as follows

f(t)dt: (1-1)
Many problems of mathematical interest lead to theL
2
-transform whose inverses are not
readily expressed in terms of tabulated functions. In the absence of methods for inversion of
theL
2
-transform, recently the authors [1-4], established a simple formula to invert theL
2
-
transform for a given function. In this article,we present some new inversion techniques for the
L
2
-transform and an application of generalized product theorem (Efros Theorem) for solving
some singular integral equation with trigonometric kernel is given. At the end, we express how
we may choose theL
2
-transform in the scope of integral transform methods as a powerful tool
for solving of a system of partial fractional differential equation in the Riemann-Liouville sense.Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2010
2 Elementary Properties of theL
2
-Transform
In this section, we recall some properties of theL
2
-transform that will be used to solve partial
differential equations.First,we state a lemma about theL
2
-transform of the  -derivatives.
Lemma 2.1 If f;f

(n 1)
are all continuous functions with a piecewise continuous
derivative f
(n)
on the interval t  0 and if all functions are of exponential order exp(c

t!1 for some constant c then for n = 1; 2;

path   of integration consists of, two segments [ R;  ], [ ;R],of the x-axis together with the
upper semi-circles C
 
:z = e

and C

:z =re

with 0< < .Also, we consider the branch
of logz which is analytic on   and its interior, hence, so is f(z). By residue theorem one has,
