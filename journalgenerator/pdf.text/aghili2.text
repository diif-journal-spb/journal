Abstract 
In this article, the authors solved certain non-homogeneous time fractional heat equations which is a 
generalization to the problem of spin- up effects on the geo strophic and quasi – geostrophic drags on  
a slowly rising products or drops in a rotating fluid. In the last three decades, transform methods have 
been used for solving fractional differential equations, singular integral equations.  
The result reveals that the transform method is very convenient and effective.

1.             Introduction 
Engineering and other areas of sciences can be successfully modeled by the use of  fractional 
derivatives. That is because of the fact that, a realistic modeling of physical phenomenon having 
dependence not only at the time instant, but also the previous time history can be successfully  
achieved by using fractional calculus. 
In this work, the authors implement transform method for solving the partial fractional diffusion 
equation which arise in applications. Several methods have been introduced to solve fractional 
differential equations, the popular Laplace transform method, [1] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ], [11] , the Fourier 
transform method [10], the iteration method [17] and operational method [ 10]. However most of  
these methods are suitable for special types of fractional differential equations, mainly the linear  
with constant coefficients. More detailed information about some of these results can be found in  
a survey paper by Kilbas and Trujillo [ 9]. Atanackovic and Stankovic [4],[5]and Stankovic [19]  
used the Laplace transform in a certain space of distributions to solve a system of partial differential 
equations with fractional derivatives, and indicated that such a system may serve as a certain model for 
a visco elastic rod. Oldham and Spanier I , [12] and [ 13] , respectively, by reducing a boundary value 
problem involving Fick’s second low in electro analytic chemistry to a formulation based on the                                                                             Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4,2011

partial  Riemann – Liouville  fractional with half  derivative. Oldham and Spanier [ 13] gave other  
application of such equations for diffusion problems. Uchaikin [20 ],[21 ] in which the connection 
between solution of linear equation of fractional order and solution of the first order has been 
established.Wyss [ 23] and Schneider [18] considered the time fractional diffusion and wave equations 
and obtained the solution in terms of  Fox functions.

2.       Main results 
In this section, the authors considered certain non-homogeneous time fractional heat equations which 
is a generalization to the problem of spin- up effects on the geostrophic and quasi – geostrophic drags 
on a slowly rising products or  drops in a rotating fluid studied by M. Ungarish [22].  
In [20] the fundamental solution for the fractional homogenous diffusion – wave equation using joint 
transform method was obtained. 
In this work, only the Laplace transformation is considered as it is easily understood and being popular 
among engineers and scientists.The basic goal of this work has been to employ the Laplace transform 
method for studying the above mentioned problem. The goal has been achieved by formally deriving 
exact analytical solution.The transform - method introduces a significant improvement in this field 
over existing techniques.

3.      CONCLUSION 
 
The paper is devoted to study and application of Laplace transform. The integral transform provides 
powerful method for analyzing linear systems. The main purpose of this work is to develop a method 
for finding formal solution of certain singular integral equation and analytic solution of the time 
fractional heat equation which is a generalization to the problem of spin up effects on the geo strophic 
and quasi -geostropic drags on a slowly rising products or drops in a rotating fluid.  
We hope that it will also benefit many researchers in the disciplines of applied mathematics,  
mathematical physics and engineering.
