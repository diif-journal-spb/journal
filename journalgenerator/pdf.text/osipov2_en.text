1 Introduction. Main deﬁnitions. Statement of results.
Theory of shadowing studies the problem of closeness of approximate and ex-
act trajectories of dynamical systems on unbounded time intervals. Since the
notions of an approximate trajectory and closeness can be formalized in sev-
eral ways, various shadowing properties are considered (cf. [1, 2]). A problem
about classical shadowing properties can be informally formulated in the fol-
lowing way: is it true that any suﬃciently precise approximate trajectory of a
dynamical system is close to some exact trajectory? In the paper [3] an inverse
problem was considered for the ﬁrst time. This problem can be informally for-
mulated as follows: suppose we have a method (pseudomethod) that generates
approximate trajectories (pseudotrajectories) of a dynamical system; is it true
that any exact trajectory is close to some pseudotrajectory generated by the
pseudomethod?
In the present paper we consider discrete dynamical systems generated by
C
1
-diffeomorphisms of closed smooth manifolds. One of the main tasks of the-
ory of shadowing is to characterise sets of all diffeomorphisms having some
shadowing property or the C
1
-interiors of such sets. One has to consider the
C
1
-interiors of the sets because for most cases it is diﬃcult or maybe impossi-
bletocharacterisethissetsin termsofhyperbolictheoryofdynamicalsystems.
FormanyshadowingpropertiestheirC

-interiorscoincidewiththesetofstruc-
turally stable or Ω-stable diffeomorphisms. K. Sakai (cf. [4]) proved that the
C
1
-interior of the set of all diffeomorphisms having the standard shadowing
property (also known as pseudo-orbit tracing property) coincides with the set
of structurally stable diffeomorphisms.
However, recently S.Yu.Pilyugin and S.B.Tikhomirovshowed [5] that Lips-
chitz shadowing property is equivalent to structural stability; and S.Yu. Pilyu-
gin,S.B.Tikhomirov,andtheauthorproved[6]thatso-calledLipschitzperiodic
shadowing property is equivalent to Ω-stability, and the C
1
-interior of the set
of all diffeomorphisms having periodic shadowing property coincides with the
set of Ω-stable diffeomorphisms. Besides, recently S.Yu.Pilyugin,D.I. Todorov,
and G.I.Wolfson (cf. [7]) developed and improved technique from the paper [5]
to prove the equivalence of Lipschitz inverse shadowing property (for certain
classes of pseudomethods) and structural stability.
While studying how well exact trajectories are approximated by pseudo-
trajectories generated by pseudomethods, it is not obligatory to consider all
points of the phase space. It is possible to restrict research to some important

invariant subset of the phase space, e.g., to the set of all periodic points. The
corresponding shadowing properties can be called inverse periodic shadowing
properties (rigorous deﬁnitions are given below). The present paper is devoted
to study of such properties. First we give main deﬁnitions, and then formulate
our results.
Let M be a closed smooth manifold with Riemannian metric dist, f be a
diffeomorphism of the manifoldM.
We say that a sequence of continuous mappings {Ψ
k
}
k∈Z
is a d-
pseudomethod if
dist(Ψ
k
(x),f(x))≤d for all x∈M. (1)
We say that a sequence θ ={x
k
}⊂M is a pseudotrajectory generated by
a d-pseudomethod Ψ ={Ψ
k
} if
x
k+1
= Ψ
k
(x
k
) ∀k∈Z. (2)
We say that a diffeomorphism f has inverse periodic shadowing property

there exists a pseudotrajectoryθ ={x

As usual, we denote by ΩS the set of all Ω-stable diffeomorphisms. We
denote by Int
1
(A) the C
1
-interior of a set A of diffeomorphisms. Finally we
denote by Per(f) the set of all periodic points of a diffeomorphismf.
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 32Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2011
Our main result is the following theorem:
Theorem.
1) Int
1
(InvPerSh) = ΩS;
2) LipInvPerSh is equivalent to hyperbolicity of the set Cl(Per(f));
3) if we denote by LIPS the set of alldiffeomorphismsthathave LipInvPerSh
and whose periodic points are dense in the nonwandering set, then LIPS
coincides with the set of Axiom A diffeomorphisms.
Remark 1. There are several ways of inroducing pseudomethods. One of
them was described above. Such pseudomethods are called pseudomethods of
class Θ
s
. The mappings Ψ
k
from the deﬁnition of pseudomethods of class Θ
s
are close to the diffeomorphism f. It is possible to consider pseudomethods
deﬁned in the following way:
We say that a sequence{Ψ
k
} of continuous mappings is ad-pseudomethod
(of class Θ
t
) if (instead of inequalities (1)) the following inequalities hold:
dist(Ψ
k+1
(x),f(Ψ
k
(x)))≤d for all x∈M, k∈Z,
and we say that a sequence {x
k
} is a pseudotrajectory generated by the pseu-
domethod{Ψ
k
} if
x
k
= Ψ
k
(x
0
) for all k∈Z.
Such pseudomethods are called pseudomethods of class Θ
t
. There are ex-
amples of pseudomethods of class Θ
s
that do not belong to class Θ
t
and vice
versa. Itispossibletointroduceinverseperiodicshadowingpropertiesforpseu-
domethods of class Θ
t
and to prove for them an analog of Theorem. The proof
will be similar; however, the pseudomethods should be constructed in a differ-
entway. In particular,foranyﬁxedk the mappingsΨ
k
shouldbe constant. We
do not describe here the process of construction of such constant mappings, as
they can be easily constructed basing on the pseudomethods of class Θ
s
whose
construction will be described in details.

follows from his results that if the set of all periodic points is non-uniformly
hyperbolic, it has a dominated splitting, and ergodic closing property holds,
then the closure of all periodic points is a hyperbolic set.
Scheme of the Theorem proof. In essence, weuse thestrategyfromthe
paper [6].
1) Denote by HP the set of all diffeomorphisms that do not have nonhy-
perbolic periodic points. Actually, it is proved in the paper [8] that HP is a
subset of LipInvPerSh. We use the result of Aoki and Hayashi (cf. [9, 10]) that
statestheequalityInt
1
(HP)= ΩS. Thus,inordertoproveitem1)ofTheorem,
it is enough to establish the inclusion Int
1
(InvPerSh) ⊂ HP. In order to get
this inclusion, we C
1
-slightly perturb a diffeomorphism with a nonhyperbolic
periodic point so that it does not have InvPerSh.
2) Let us describe the scheme of the proof of item 2). First we prove that
LipInvPerShimplieshyperbolicityofanyperiodicpoint,thenweproveuniform
hyperbolicity of the set of all periodic points, and ﬁnally we establish the fact
that the closure of all periodic points is a hyperbolic set.
3) In essence, item 2) implies item 3) because, by deﬁnition, Axiom A is
equivalent to hyperbolicity of the nonwandering set and density of periodic
points in the nonwandering set.
2 Technical remarks and the exponential map
The proof of Theorem consists of several lemmas. The proof of most of them
uses a known technique based on the exponentialmap, which allowsto transfer
results from points in the manifold to tangent vectors and vice versa. We shall
describe this technique in this section. Besides, it is convenient to introduce in
this section main notations, which will be used in the sequel.
Let M be a closed smooth manifold with Riemannian metric dist. Denote
by exp : TM 7→ M the standard exponential map and by exp
x
its restriction
to T
x
M, the tangent space at point x.
Denote by N(r,x) the r-neighborhood of the point x in the manifold M,
by B
T
(r,y) the ball of radius r with center at the point y in the space T
x
M.
Besides, we denote byB(r,A) ther-neighborhood of the setA that is a subset
of an Euclidean space.
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 34Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2011
There exists a positive number r < 1 such that for any point x ∈ M the
mapping exp
x
is a diffeomorphism of the set B
T
(r,0) onto its image, and the
mapping exp
−1
x
is a diffeomorphism of the set N(r,x) onto its image. Besides,
we assume that the number r is chosen so small that the following holds:
dist(exp
x
(v),exp
x
(w))
|v−w|
≤ 2 for v,w∈B
T
(r,x),v6=w; (4)
|exp
−1
x
(y)−exp
−1
x
(z)|
dist(y,z)
≤ 2 for y,z ∈N(r,x),y6=z. (5)
We can always get this conditions, because
Dexp

Let p be a point of a diffeomorphismf of the manifold M, let p
k
=f
k
(p)
and A
k
= Df(p
k
) for all k ∈ Z (this notations will be used in the sequel).

By the standard property (6) of the exponential map, DF

We denote byO(p,f)the trajectoryof the pointp of the diffeomorphismf,
i.e.,O(p,f)={p
k
=f
k
(p)|k∈Z}.
Besides, we need the following auxiliary statement, which will be used for
construction of pseudomethods:
Proposition. Let f : B(b,O(p,f)) 7→ R
n
be a C

-smooth map, p
be a periodic point of the map f of the fundamental period m, let sets

Then there exists a map Ψ : B(b,O(p,f)) 7→ R
n
such that |Ψ(x)−f(x)| ≤
≤ d for all x ∈ B(b,p
k
), 1 ≤ k ≤ m, the mappings ψ and Ψ coin-
cide on the set B(ǫ/2,O(p,f)), and the maps Ψ and f coincide on the set
B(b,O(p,f))\B(ǫ,O(p,f)).

number such that Cd<b/2. Let

),1≤k≤m,
where|φ
k
(x)|−→0 as |x|→ 0. Assume that d is so small that
|φ
k
(x)|≤d/2 for |x|≤Cd.
Finally assume that we have constructed a continuous map ψ :
B(b,O(p,f))7→R
n
such that condition (8) holds with d/2 instead of d. Then
there exists a map Ψ : B(b,O(p,f))7→R
n
such that |Ψ(x)−f(x)|≤ d for all
x∈B(b,O(p,f)),the mapsψ and Ψ coincide on the setB(Cd/2,O(p,f)),and
the maps Ψ and f coincide on the set B(b,O(p,f))\B(Cd,O(p,f)).
Proof. Let us start from item 1). Choose a smooth monotonous function
β : [0,+∞)7→ [0,1] such thatβ(x)= 0 for x≤ǫ/2, β(x)= 1 forx≥ǫ.
Deﬁne the map Ψ by the following formula:
Ψ(x)= (1−β(|x−p
k
|))ψ(x)+β(|x−p
k
|)(p
k+1
+A
k
(x−p
k
))
for x∈B(b,p
k
), 1≤k≤m. For x∈B(b,p
k
) we have the formula
|Ψ(x)−f(x)|=|Ψ(x)−(β(|x−p
k
|)+1−β(|x−p
k
|))f(x)|≤ (1−β(x))d+0≤d.
Clearly, the map Ψ is the desired.
Item 2) can be proved in the similar way.

Thus, the following lemma holds:
Lemma 1. If the set Cl(Per(f)) is hyperbolic, then f has LipInvPerSh.
Corollary. ΩS ⊂ Int

(InvPerSh).
Lemma 2. Int
1
(InvPerSh)⊂ ΩS.
Proof. By the lemma of Hayashi and Aoki ([9, 10]), Int
1
(HP) = ΩS. That
is why it is enough to prove that Int
1
(InvPerSh) ⊂ HP. Assume that the
diffeomorphism f ∈ Int
1
(InvPerSh) and does not belong to HP. Thus, there
exists a neighborhoodW of the diffeomorphismf in theC
1
-topologysuch that
W ⊂ InvPerSh and W ∩HP = ∅. The diffeomorphism f has a nonhyperbolic
periodic point p of the fundamental period m, i.e., the operator Df
m
(p) has
an eigenvalue|λ| = 1. Without loss of generality, we assume thatλ is a purely
complex number. The case of a real λ can be treated in the similar way.
At ﬁrst we C

There exists a number a ∈ (0,r) (recall that the number r was deﬁned in

Thus, the diffeomorphism h is C

The maps ψ

can be considered as mappings from the disjoint union of

to the the disjoint union of larger n-dimensional
balls in R

. Choose an arbitrary number k ∈ Z. We observe that the
maps ψ
k
satisfy condition (8). Thus, in essence, all conditions of Proposi-
tion from section 2 are satisﬁed. Since we can decrease d, we can assume
that d is a number from item 1) of Proposition that is applied to the num-
ber ǫ

(not number ǫ) as ǫ and the map ψ
k
(we put b = ¯ a). By Re-
mark 2, the choice of d does not depend on the map ψ

if condition (8)
holds. Consequently, the map ψ

can be extended to the map Φ

However, no pseudotrajectory generated by this 2d-pseudomethod can ǫ-
shadow the pointp. In fact, suppose the contrary, consider a pseudotrajectory

this pseudotrajectory ǫ-shadows the point p. Put q = exp

are wrong, the diffeomorphism f does not have any nonhyperbolic periodic
points, and the C

Lemma 3. Ifadiffeomorphismf hasLipInvPerSh,thenanyperiodicpoint
is hyperbolic.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that the number L from the
deﬁnition of LipInvPerSh is natural.
Let p be a nonhyperbolic point of the diffeomorphism f. We assume that
p is a ﬁxed point, in order to simplify the notations. The general case can
be treated in the similar way. In the case of a ﬁxed point, the map (7) is
represented in the following way:

and the matrix A has an eigenvalue |λ| = 1. We assume that λ is a purely

The last inequality contradicts to inequality (11). Hence, the diffeomorphism
f does not have any nonhyperbolic periodic points.
Lemma 4. Ifadiffeomorphismf hasLipInvPerSh,thenallperiodicpoints
of the diffeomorphismf are uniformlyhyperbolic(i.e. they arehyperbolicwith
the same constants C and λ). In other words, there exist constants C > 0
and 0 < λ < 1 depending only on L such that for any periodic point p of the
diffeomorphismf there existDf-invariant complementary subspaces S(p) and
U(p) of the tangent space T

|v| for v∈S(p), j ≥ 0;
|Df

Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that the number L from the
property LipInvPerSh is natural.
Let p be a periodic point of a period m. Denote by m

the fundamental
period of the point p. Put p

Lemma 3, the point p is a hyperbolic periodic point. Hence, there exist com-

It follows from relations (12) that there exists a number n> 0 such that

Thus, we can consider the sequence{w

PutN > max

assume thatN > 20L. It is clear that if all vectors from the sequence{w

multiplied by d, then the maximum will increase in d times too.

Thus, we proved equalities (14) and (15). Note that the maps ψ
k
were con-
structed in such way that this equalities would hold.
Observe that, by inequality (13), the maps ψ
k
satisfy the analog of con-
dition (8) with 2d instead of d/2. Fix an arbitrary k ∈ Z. We see that
all conditions of item 2) of Proposition are satisﬁed. We apply Proposition
to C = 100N, b = ǫ
2
. Since we can decrease the number d, we can as-
sume that it is less than d/4, where d is from item 2) of Proposition. Let
us emphasize that, by Remark 2, the number d does not depend on the in-
dex k. Denote by Φ
k
the analog of the map Ψ
k
constructed in Proposition.
By the statement of Proposition, |Φ

Clearly, if we deﬁne the maps Ψ
k
to be equal to the diffeomorphism f for
all other points of the manifold M, then the maps Ψ
k
will remain being con-
tinuous maps. Note that, by inequalities (4), the maps Ψ
k
generate an 8d-
pseudomethod.
By our assumptions, the point p is 8Ld-shadowed by one of pseudotrajec-
tories generated by the pseudomethod Ψ = {Ψ
k
}. It follows that there exists
a pseudotrajectory {y
k
} of the point y deﬁned by the analog of equalities (2)
such thatthe pointp is8Ld-shadowedby thispseudotrajectory. It followsfrom
our assumptions that
|q
k
|≤ 16Ld. (16)
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 43Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2011
Note that 16Ld < 50Ld, and the maps Φ
k
and ψ
k
coincide on the 50Ld-
neighborhood of zero (in the space T
p
k
M).

In (17) and (18) the norm of the second term is estimated from above by
Nd> 20Ld,whereas,byhyperbolicityofthepointp,theﬁrstterminoneofthis
formulae has a large norm (larger than 2Nd) for k with large absolute values
(i.e. thenormoftheﬁrsttermismuchlargerthanthenormofthesecondterm)
if q 6= w

d. Thus, the point p can be shadowed only by the pseudotrajectory
corresponding to the vectorw
0
d, i.e. q =w
0
d. But then inequalities(16) imply
the estimates
|a
k
|=|w
k
|≤ 16L for 0≤k≤m−1.
This estimates imply the desired hyperbolicity estimates for any preliminary
ﬁxed vectorv (cf. [6] for detailed explanation).
Note that, actually, Lemma 4 implies item 2) of Theorem (and, conse-
quently, item 3) too); since it is proved in the paper [6] that if the statement
of Lemma 4 holds, i.e., the set Per(f) has a hyperbolic structure, then the set
Cl(Per(f))has a hyperbolicstructuretoo, i.e., the set Cl(Per(f))ishyperbolic.
