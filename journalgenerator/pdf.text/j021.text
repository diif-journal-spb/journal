Abstract.
Using the method of Lie group of transformations and the direct method,
solitarywaveandexplodedecaymodesolutionsofacombinedKdV-Boussinesq
equation governing weakly nonlinear shallow water waves have been derived.
1 Introduction
Nonlinearity and dispersion are two of the most fundamental concepts in wave
motions in nature. The nonlinear shallow water equations governed by the
hyperbolic type lead to the wave breaking phenomena. These equations which
neglect dispersion develop a vertical slope and a multiple-valued wave proﬁle.
Breaking is prevented by including dispersive effects into the shallow waterDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 1998
theory. In 1895, Korteweg and de Vries showed that long waves, in water of
relatively shallow depth, could be described by a nonlinear equation which is
now known as Korteweg de Vries equation
1)
. Periodic solutions of this equation
were found in terms of Jacobian elliptic functions cn, known as cnoidal waves.
The inﬁnite period counterpart of this solution is the single hump solitary wave
solution moving with no change in shape, size and speed. Another example
of an equation governing long waves on the surface of shallow water is the
Boussinesq equation which include waves moving to both left and right
2)
.
In this paper, we consider a combined KdV and Boussinesq equation gov-
erning long waves in shallow water. Considering travelling wave solutions, we
reduce the basic equations to a second order ordinary differential equation. In
section 3, using the method of Lie group of transformations
3,4)
, we reduce it
to a ﬁrst order ordinary differential equation. In section 4, we derive using
the direct method
5,6)
, periodic solutions in terms of elliptic functions and the
corresponding solitary wave and the explode decay mode solutions. In section
5, we plot the solitary wave and the explode decay mode solutions.
2 Weakly nonlinear shallow water equations
We consider an inviscid and incompressible ﬂuid of constant depth h. We take
the (x,y)− plane as the undisturbed free surface with the z− axis positive
upward. The free surface elevation above the undisturbed depth h is z =
η(x,y,t), so that the free surface is at z = h+η and z = 0 is the horizontal
rigid bottom.
If φ(x,y,z,t) is the velocity potential of an unbounded ﬂuid lying between
the rigid bottomz = 0 and the free surfacez = η(x,y,t) as shown in the ﬁgure
below,

We shall consider two cases when the shallow water wave speed is the same as
the travelling wave speed and when they are unequal.
Case1 (U

We assume a solution in the form
w = A℘(z), (4.2)

The condition (4.4) puts the restriction on μ as

Therefore, the solution is

The solitary wave limits are obtained when the period is inﬁnite which
occurs when the modulus of the Jacobian elliptic function is equal to unity.

5 Numerical Results
In case 1, β = 0. Taking h = 1 and B = 1, we have α = 1.5, γ ≈ −0.3061
and g

where, μ satisﬁes (4.11). For solitary wave
solution, e
1
≈ 0.113, e
2
≈ 0.113 and e

≈ −0.226. Thus the solitary wave
solution is given by,
u(x,t) = −1.415+4.245sech

(0.582x−1.823t). (5.1)
This is plotted in Fig.1.
The corresponding explode decay mode solution is plotted in Fig.2 given by

(0.582x−1.823t). (5.2)
In case 2, where U

wave solution (See Fig.3) and the corresponding explode decay mode solution
(See Fig.4) are given respectively by
u(x,t) = −0.4tanh
