Abstract 
 
The Boubaker polynomials were established and discussed in several previous studies, as 
a polynomial sequence related to a solution to the heat transfer equation in a special model 
of a vertical spray device. In the last years, many attempts to find a characteristic differential 
equation or a quasi-polynomial expression to these polynomials were yielded. 
 In this paper, we propose a Sturm-Liouville shaped characteristic differential equation to 
the Boubaker Polynomials as a supply to further efforts for proposing different analytic 
expression. The actual attempt is compared to the lastly proposed incomplete differential 
equation of the m-Boubaker polynomials.

1   Introduction 
 
 The Boubaker polynomials were established in a physics study that 
yielded a thermal model of the pyrolysis spray (fig. 1.a and 1.b)  
disposal[1]. It was stated in this study that an attempt to solve the heat 
transfer equation between the bulk and the substrate, led to the definition 
of recursive formula. This formula itself led to a  serial of polynomial 
functions[1] that had particular proprieties . These functions, that allowed 
the proposition of a concrete solution to the heat equation, were presented 
to the local mathematics community as a new polynomial class[2] . An 
original study about them has been accepted for publication in an applied 
mathematics journal[3]. Recently, the m-Boubaker polynomials (modified 
Boubaker polynomials) have been defined as an ameliorated form that was 
more appropriated for defining a characteristic differential equation[4] .The 
Boubaker polynomials are already registered under their final form[5].

In the ordinary spray deposition process at ambient temperature, the 
precursor solution arrives at the substrate in the form of very small 
droplets. Droplet constituents react and form a chemical compound onto 
the substrate. The chemical reactants are selected such that substances 
other than desired compound are volatile at the temperature of deposition 
and before final solidification. 
Uniform deposition is better ensured by moving adequately nozzle or 
substrate support (fig. 1.b) . In the modeled disposal, substrate support is 
fixed due to heating source size. Nozzle relative position versus targeted 
sample is constant in actual studied models. Solution anion to cation ratio, 
spray rate, substrate temperature, ambient atmosphere and carrier gas 
properties are invariable and thus considered first as exogenous 
parameters. 
In the last decades, several models were proposed for the pyrolysis spray 
setup. Chaouachi et al. [1] proposed  a thermal transfer model based on 
resolving the heat transfer equation, that takes into account the boundary 
conditions, especially at the level of the substrate-precursor interface. 
 
 
 
2    The Boubaker polynomials  
 
The Boubaker polynomials merged from an attempt to yield a solution to 
heat equation. In fact, in a calculation step during resolution process[1], an Differential Equations and Control Processes, № 2, 2007  
 
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal  120 
intermediate calculus sequence raised an interesting recursive formula 
leading to a class of polynomial functions that performs difference with 
common classes.

(eq. 4). Demonstrations of equations (3-4) are available in appendixes of 
previous studies[2-4].

The Sturm-Liouville equation is named after Jacques Charles François 
Sturm[8],  and Joseph Liouville[9], it is a real second-order linear 
differential equation of the form (eq. 11.a) :

where  p(x), q(x), and ω(x) are specified at the outset, and in the simplest of 
cases are continuous on the finite closed interval [a,b]. The function ω (x) is 
called the "weight" or "density" functions. The value of λ is not specified in 
the equation; finding the values of λ for which there exist a non-trivial 
solution of (eq.11.a) satisfying the boundary conditions is part of the 
problem called the Sturm-Liouville problem . 
 
Such values of λ when they exist are called the eigenvalues of the boundary 
value problem defined by (eq.11.a) and the prescribed set of boundary 
conditions. The corresponding solutions are the eigenfunctions of this 
problem. The resulting theory of the existence and asymptotic behavior of 
the eigenvalues, the corresponding qualitative theory of the eigenfunctions 
and their completeness in a suitable function space is known as Sturm-
Liouville theory. This theory is important in applied mathematics, where 
Sturm-Liouville problems occur very commonly, particularly when dealing 
with linear partial differential equations which are separable.  
Many well-known equations are Sturm-Liouville shaped or can be 
transformed to be so. We can mention Bessel's equation (eq. 11.b)

4.2   The case of Boubaker polynomials 
 
 
Since their establishment, the Boubaker polynomials were deeply studied 
and discussed. For a long time, the authors attempted to express these 
polynomials as solutions to a second order Sturm-Liouville shaped 
characteristic differential equation. For this purpose, they had to modify 
the earlier defined polynomials [5], just for giving a Chebyshev shaped 
expression. While working on the eventual formulations of the Boubaker 
polynomials, we were led to an expression based on complex functions 
analysis and formulated the following way:  
 
Let’s define a complex function that verifies the condition expressed by (eq. 
12): 
 
 
function kind first   Bessel :      and  ) ( Re ) ( with

This expression (eq.17.f) is the early unfound Sturm-Liouville shaped 
characteristic differential equation which is proposed in order to 
investigate the Boubaker polynomials. The previous given ones were either 
monomial or recursive. It is well known that those forms are not 
appropriated for setting characteristic quasi-polynomial expressions. 
This expression is a valuable guide for further investigations. For example, 
the calculation of the real roots of the Boubaker polynomials, which is the 
object of an in-course study,  is more suitable with expression (eq. 17.f)  
than the expression (eq. 1.e.). 
Furthermore, in an earlier stage of investigation, the Boubaker polynomials 
B
m
(X) explicit monomial form evoked, while prospected, some singularities 
for m=4, 8, 12, etc. In fact for the general case: m=4q the 2q rank monomial 
term is removed from the explicit form so that the whole expression 
contains only 2q effective terms. Correspondent 4q-order Boubaker 
polynomials  (eq. 18) were easily calculated using both (eq. 17.f)  and the 
well-known Newton binomial development of (a+b)
n
 term. 
 
 
                                         
                                                                                                                                                          .             (18)   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thanks to these expressions (eq. 18 and  eq. 17.e), it has been conjectured 
and demonstrated that the number of real positive roots, for high values of 
q is 2q-1, and are contained exclusively in the domain ]0;2[. 
 
The investigation of the real positive roots of these polynomials could also 
be achieved using dichotomy method (D.M.). It yielded for example the 
table 1.

5   Perspectives   
 
 
We proposed a Sturm-Liouville shaped characteristic differential equation 
to the recently defined Boubaker polynomials[1-5,6-9]. The main 
advantages of this differential equation polynomials are illustrated by 
some examples concerning real roots and 4q-order polynomials. We are 
working now on an eventual quasi-polynomial expression to these 
polynomials, expression that would be an important support for 
investigating Boubaker polynomials real positive roots and eventual sub-
families particularities.
