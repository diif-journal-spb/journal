Dynamical systems on manifolds
On absolute nonshadowability of transitive maps
Sergey Tikhomirov

Abstract
We study shadowing property for random in nite pseudotrajectories of a continuous
mapf of a compact metric space. For the cases of transitive maps and transitive attractors
we prove a dichotomy: either f satis es shadowing property or random pseudotrajectory
is shadowable with probability 0.
Keywords: shadowing, transitivity, attractor, Markov chain
1 Introduction
The theory of shadowing of approximate trajectories (pseudotrajectories) of dy-
namical systems is now a well-developed part of the global theory of dynamical
systems (see the monographs [10, 11] and [13] for a survey of modern results).
The shadowing problem is related to the following question: under which con-
ditions, for any pseudotrajectory of f does there exist a close trajectory?
It is known that a diffeomorphismf has the shadowing property in a neigh-
borhood of a hyperbolic set [3, 4]. Moreover if f is structurally stable (see
de nition for example in [7, 12]) then it has the shadowing property on the
whole manifold. At the same time, it is easy to give an example of a diffeomor-
phism that is not structurally stable but has the shadowing property (see [17],
for instance). Thus, structural stability is not equivalent to shadowing.

At the same time it was proved that in several contexts shadowing and
structural stability are equivalent. Sakai prove that the C
1
-interior of the set
of diffeomorphisms having the shadowing property coincides with the set of
structurally stable diffeomorphisms [16] (see [14] for a similar result for the
orbital shadowing property). Abdenur and Diaz conjectured that a C
1
-generic
diffeomorphism with the shadowing property is structurally stable; they have
proved this conjecture for the so-called tame diffeomorphisms [2]. Jointly with
S. Pilyugin the author proved that so-called Lipschitz shadowing is equivalents
to structural stability [15]. Thus, set of not structurally stable diffeomorphisms
satisfying shadowing property is not very reach.
It is a natural problem to  nd a shadowing property which is satis ed for
a broader class of diffeomorphisms. One of the possible approaches is to con-
sider random pseudotrajectories: endow the space of pseudotrajectories with a
probability measure and  nd su cient conditions for probability of a pseudo-
trajectory to be shadowable to be close to 1 or at least positive.
Such studies were initiated in [19]. In this work Yuan, Yorke constructed an
open set of diffeomorphisms for which probability of a pseudotrajectory to be
shadowable is 0. In a recent work [18] the author considered a special example
of linear skew product and found probability of a  nite pseudotrajectory to be
shadowable.
Despite the naturalness of randomness approach currently consideration of
 nite pseudotrajectories is more developed [5, 6, 17, 18]. One of the reasons is
lack of positive results about shadowing of random pseudotrajectories.
In the present paper we prove that such a positive result is not possible:
under transitivity assumption either all pseudotrajectories are shadowable or
probability of a pseudotrajectory to be shadowable is 0. Precise statements
of the results for transitive maps and transitive attractors are formulated in
Theorems 1, 2 respectively.
2 Transitive maps
Let (M; dist) be a compact metric space endowed with a  nite Borel measure ,
such that for any open set U the inequality  (U)> 0 holds. For a> 0, x2M
denote by B(a;x) the open ball of radius a centered at x. Let f :M!M be
a homeomorphism.
Let I = [0;N] or I = [0; +1). For d> 0 we say that sequencefy

We say that a d-psedotrajectoryfy
n

can be "-shadowed for " > 0 if there
exists x

2M such that
dist(y

)) "; n2I: (2)
We say that f has shadowing property if for any "> 0 there exists d> 0 such
that any d-pseudotrajectoryfy
n
g
n 0
can be "-shadowed.
Remark 1. In the de nitions of pseudotrajectories and shadowing in equations
(1), (2) usually are used strict inequalities. The de nition of the shadowing
property with not strict inequalities is equivalent to the classical one and allows
us to simplify the notation in the proofs of main results.
For y

2 M, d > 0, N 2 N[f+1g denote by 

N
(y

d-pseudotrajectoriesfy

starting at y

. Let us consider point y

being
chosen at random in B(d;f(y

)) uniformly with respect to the measure  : for
a measurable set A M the equality
P (y

2Ajy
n
) =
 (A\B(d;f(y

 (B(d;f(y

holds. Then 

N
(y

;d) forms a Markov chain. This naturally endows 

N
(y

with a probability measure P
y

N
. For simplicity for N = +1 we will omit it:

(y

Remark 2. This concept was introduced in [19] for in nite pseudotrajectories,
see also [18] for a similar concept for  nite pseudotrajectories.

any trajectory of f cannot be "-shadowed. In [19] Yuan and Yorke provided a
class of examples of absolutely not shadowable diffeomorphism. Based on the
same technique Abdenur and Diaz proved that absolute nonshadowability isC
1
generic among not structurally stable maps.
We say that f is transitive if there exists r2M such that
O
+
(r;f) =M: (3)
In [2] Abdenur and Diaz proved thatC
1
-robustly transitive and not hyper-
bolic diffeomorphisms are absolutely not shadowable. Their proof is based on
construction of periodic orbits with different indices.
In the present paper we remove the differentiability assumption, and what
is more important, do not assume any properties of the perturbation of f.
Theorem 1. If f is a transitive map then one of the following holds
(i) f has the shadowing property;
(ii) f is absolutely not shadowable.
In the proof we will use the following folklore result.
Lemma 1. If for any " > 0 there exists d > 0 such that any  nite d-
pseudotrajectoryfy
n
g
N
n=0
, N > 0 can be "-shadowed then f satis es the shad-
owing property.
Proof of Theorem 1. Assume that f does not satisfy shadowing property.
Lemma 1 implies that there exists"> 0 such that for anyd> 0 there exists
N and a d=2-pseudotrajectoryfp
n
g
N
n=0
which cannot be "-shadowed.
Take this"> 0 and  x arbitrarily d> 0 and corresponding N andfp
n
g
N
n=0
a not "-shadowable d=2-pseudotrajectory. Below we will show that
p(y

Let us note that any sequencefz

is not "=2-shadowable.
Since f is continuous there exists   > 0 such that for any x2 M, y2

3 Transitive attractors
We say that an invariant compact set   is an attractor if there exists an open
neighborhoodU of   such thatf(U) U and\
n 0
f
n
(U) =A, see for instance
[8]. See book [9] for systematic studies of properties of attractors.
We will use the following two properties of an attractor:
1. dist(f
n
(x);  )! 0 as n!1 for any x2U;
2. for any neighborhood V   U of   there exists a neighborhood W   V
such that
f(W ) W: (9)
Denote by D( ) the domain of attraction of  :
D( ) :=fx2M : dist(f
n
(x);  )! 0g:
Note that D( ) =[
n 0
f
 n
(U).
We say thatf has the shadowing property on   if for any"> 0 there exists
d > 0 such that for any d-pseudotrajectoryfy
n
g
n 0
    there exists x
0
2 M
(not necessarily belonging to  ) such that inequalities (2) hold.
We say that set   is transitive if there exists r2   such that
  =O
+
(r;f):
The assumption for a map to be transitive is quite restrictive. At the same
time it is quite common for attractors. In some works transitivity is included
in the de nition of attractor [1]. In this work it was proved that transitive
attractors persists under C
1
-generic perturbations.

Theorem 2. Let   be a transitive attractor not satisfying shadowing property
then there exists "

Remark 3. Note that in Theorem 1 the choice of d was uniform with respect
to y
