Abstract. A diffeomorphism f is hyperbolic on a chain-recurrent set if the
Morse spectrum does not contain zero. The symbolic image is a directed graph
approximating a dynamical system. The chain-recurrent set is localized using
this graph. The symbolic image of the differential allows us to estimate the
Morse spectrum. A diffeomorphism f is structurally stable if the dual differ-
ential has only trivial bounded trajectories. The symbolic image of the dual
differential makes it possible to check the absence of bounded trajectories of
the dual differential.
Keywords: Lyapunov exponent, chain-recurrent set, projective bundle, pseu-
dotrajectory, invariant decomposition, directed graph, adjacency matrix, strong
component, extreme cycle.

that x

for all n. Then the points x

are called "-periodic. The exact
trajectory of the system is rarely known in practice, as a rule, we work with
"-trajectories for su ciently small positive ".
De nition 2 A pointx is called chain-recurrent ifx is"-periodic for any"> 0,
that is, there exists a periodic "-trajectory passing through the point x.
The chain-recurrent set consists of all chain-recurrent points and is denoted by
CR. The chain-recurrent set CR is invariant, closed and contains all types of

return trajectories: periodic, almost-periodic, nonwandering, homoclinic, etc.
Note that if the chain-recurrent point is not periodic and dimM > 1, then
there is an arbitrarily small perturbation f in the C
0
-topology for which this
point is periodic [30]. We can say that chain-recurrent points generate peri-
odic trajectories under C
0
-perturbations. Therefore, in computer calculations,
chain-recurrent points look like periodic points of su ciently large period.
De nition 3 Two chain-recurrent points are called equivalent if they can be
connected by a periodic "-trajectory for any " > 0. The chain-recurrent set is
divided into equivalence classesf

i
g, which we will call the components of the
chain-recurrent set.
1.1 Lyapunov Exponent
Every nondegenerate linear mapping A : R
d
! R
d
can be represented in the
form
Av =jAvj 
Av
jAvj
=rjAej 
Ae
jAej
=rjAej A
s
(e);
where r =jvj; jvj6= 0; e = v=jvj2 S
d 1
, and S
d 1
is the unit sphere. Thus,
the linear mapping A :v!Av is the product of two mappings
e!A
s
(e) =
Ae
jAej
and r!rjAej;
where the  rst of them acts on the sphere S
d 1
, and the other acts on the
positive half-line R
+
. A projective space P
d 1
is a set of the one-dimensional
subspaces in R
d
. The projective space P
d 1
can be obtained by identifying
antipodal points of the sphere S
d 1
. Symmetry of the mapping A
s
(e) with
respect to the sign change A
s
( e) = A
s
(e) enables us to de ne a mapping
PA(e) = Ae=jAej onto the projective space P
d 1
by identifying the antipodal
points on the sphere. We preserve the notation e for the points of the space
P
d 1
; that is, e stands for the one-dimensional subspace and (or) a unit vector
on the subspace, which does not lead to confusion. Thus, for the diffeomorphism
f we obtain the mapping

the angle between the subspaces.

of the mapping Pf(x;e) = (f(x);

2 Symbolic image of dynamical system
Let C = fM(1);:::;M(n)g be a  nite covering of a manifold M by closed
subsets. The set M(i) will be referred to the cell of the index i.
De nition 4 [17] Symbolic image of the dynamical system (1) for a covering
C is a directed graph G with vertices V =fig corresponding to cellsfM(i)g.
Two verticesi andj are connected by a directed edge (an arc)i!j if and only
if
f(M(i))
\
M(j)6=;:
The symbolic image is a powerful tool for investigation of integral properties
of dynamical system. The symbolic image generates the symbolic dynamics,
which reects the dynamics of system (1). We do not impose special restric-
tions on the coverage of C, but basing on the theorem about triangulation of
compact manifold we may without loss of generality assume that cellsM(i) are
polyhedrons that intersect in boundary disks. In numerical calculations (see
[3]), M is a compact domain in R
d
, and M(i) are cubes or parallelepipeds.
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.302 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 26Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
Construction of a symbolic image based on numerical calculations is always
only an estimation of the \real" symbolic image. The algorithms used for an
e cient calculation of symbolic image are discussed in the papers [3, 9, 22].
There is a number of issues that need to be considered when building a cell
image. Cells of covering, as a rule, are selected as rectangular parallelepipeds.
To construct edge i!j, we need to check that f(M(i))\M(j)6=;.
For our implementation we use the following simple way to construct an
approximation of cell image f(M(i)). Each cell M(i) is approximated by a
 nite set of so-called scan points. The number N of scan points for the cells as
well as positions of these points are parameters of the described method which
must be set by user. There is no general strategy how the scan points should be
placed within the cell. Our practice shows that the good strategy is when the
scan points uniformly distributed within the cell. Number N is determined by
two factors: counting time and accuracy of calculating the cell image. Usually
for smooth systems 10 N  100 is quite su cient. It is further assumed that
arrow i!j exists if there is a scan point x
 
2M(i) such that f(x
 
)2M(j).
A doubly in nite sequencefz
k
; k2Zg of vertices of a graph G is called a
path (or an admissible path) if, for each k, the graph G contains the directed
edge z
k
! z
k+1
. If the symbolic image is calculated as above, then a path
! = fi
n
; n 2 Zg generates a point sequence  (!) = fx
n
; n 2 Zg, where
x
n
2 M(i
n
) is a scan point such that f(x
n
) 2 M(i
n+1
). In this case, the
distance
 (f(x
n
);x
n+1
) d;
where d is the maximal cell diameter. Thus, the sequencefx
n
; n2 Zg is an
"-trajectory for any ">d.
Five methods of constructing a cell image are considered in the disserta-
tion [22]. There is a natural correspondence between admissible paths on the
symbolic image G and "-trajectories of the homeomorphism f.
Theorem 3 (Weak shadowing property) [20]
1. If a sequencefz
k
; k2Zg is a path on the symbolic imageG and a sequence
fx
k
; k2 Zg is such that x
k
2 M(z
k
), then the sequencefx
k
g is an "-
trajectory of f for any ">q +d.
2. If a sequencefz
k
; k2 Zg is a path on the symbolic image G then there
exists a sequencefx
k
; k2Zg; x
k
2M(z
k
) that is an "-trajectory of f for
any ">d.

3. There existsr> 0 such that if a sequencefx
k
; k2Zg is an"-trajectory of
f, "<r, and x
k
2M(z
k
), then the sequencefz
k

path on the symbolic image G.
An admissible path in symbolic image can be thought of as a pseudotrajectory
encoding. Each trajectory Tr =fx
n

!(Tr) =fi
n
g such thatx

2M(i

2.1 Transition Matrix
The directed graphG is uniquely determined by its (adjacency) matrix of tran-
sitions   = ( 
ij
), where  
ij
= 1 if and only if there is the directed edge i!j,
otherwise  
ij
= 0. Let
 
2
=
 
 
2
ij
 
be the square of the transition matrix, where  
2
ij
=
P
n
k=1
 
ik
 
kj
; and upper
script 2 stands for an index (not for power). The sum
P
n
k=1
 
ik
 
kj
= 
2
ij
is the
number of all admissible paths of length 2 from i to j. In the similar way one
can verify that the entry  
p
ij
is the number of all admissible paths of length p
from i to j.
De nition 5 A vertex of the symbolic image is called recurrent if there is a
periodic path passing through it. The set of recurrent vertices is denoted byRV:
Two recurrent vertices i and j are called equivalent if there is a periodic path
containing i and j.
The set of recurrent verticesRV is decomposed into classesfH
k
g of equivalent
recurrent vertices. In the graph theory, the classes H
k
are called strongly con-
nected components. There are algorithms for constructing strongly connected
components based on depth- rst bypass of the graph [8, 31]. The most popular
is algorithm of Robert Tarjan [32].
Let us introduce a quasi-order relation between the vertices of a symbolic
image. We assume that i  j if and only if there exists an admissible path of
the form
i =i
0
;i

;i

;:::;i
m
=j:
Hence, a vertexi is recurrent if and only ifi i, and recurrent verticesi; j are
equivalent if and only if i j i.
Proposition 1 [1] The vertices of a symbolic image G can be renumbered so
that
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.302 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 28Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
  the equivalent recurrent vertices are numbered with consecutive integers;
  the new numbersi; j of other vertices are chosen so thati<j ifi j6 i:
In other words, the transition matrix has the form

where the elements under the diagonal blocks are zeros, each diagonal block
 
k
corresponds to either a class of equivalent recurrent vertices H
k
or a non-
recurrent vertex. In the last case  
k
coincides with a single zero. A numbering
fig of matrix rows of the  
k
diagonal block coincides with the vertices num-
bering of the H
k
class. This kind of transition matrix can be called an upper
triangular. In graph theory, the described renumbering of vertices is called
topological graph sorting.
2.2 Localization of Chain-Recurrent Set
Let G be a symbolic image with respect to a covering C and d be diameter of
the coveringC. The multivalued mappingh :M!V associates with the point
x all the vertices of i such that x2M(i).
Proposition 2 [21] The map h has the following properties.
1. If x is a chain-recurrent point and i2h(x), then i is a recurrent vertex.
2. If x

and x
2
lie in the same component of the chain-recurrent set 
,
i

), then i
1
and i
2
are equivalent recurrent vertices.
3. If 
 is a component of a chain-recurrent set, then there exists a unique
class H(
) of equivalent recurrent vertices such that h(
) H(
).
Let 
 be a component of a chain-recurrent set. From the Proposition 2 it
follows that the image h(
) lies in some class of equivalent recurrent vertices,
which we denote H(
), the component 
 lies inf

that the class H(

A component of the chain-recurrent set

jectory Q( 1:5584; 1:9046), (3:0088; 1:2438), which generates a homoclinic

max

be the minimum and maximum of the averages over simple periodic paths of the
class H. Cycles on which  
min
(H) or  
max
(H) are reached are called extreme
cycles. The algorithm for calculating extremal cycles is presented in [19].

the intervals [ 
min
(H

); 
max
(H

)]; wherefH
k
g is a complete family of classes
of equivalent recurrent vertices of the graph G.
2.4 Estimation of the Averaging Spectrum
To calculate the spectrum of the averaging of a function over pseudotrajectories
of a dynamical system, we construct the function on the symbolic image by
setting a value a[ij] for each edge i! j, as follows. Let i! j be an edge
on G. Fixing a point x in each cell M(i), we set a[ij] = '(x). Note that the
value a[ij] = b[i] is independent of j. If x
 
is another point from M(i) and
a
 
[ji] ='(x
 
), then we have the estimate
ja
 
[ij] a[ij]j =j'(x) '(x
 
)j< (d);
where (d) is the modulus of continuity of the function' andd is the diameter
of the covering.
Consider the constructed function on the symbolic image G. According to
the previous theorem, we can  nd the averaging spectrum of the symbolic image
in a  nite number of steps. The task is to estimate the averaging spectrum  
of the function ' through the spectrum of the symbolic image  (G).
Theorem 6 [21]
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.302 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 32Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
1. The spectrum   of averaging of the function' lies in the extended spectrum
 
 
of the symbolic image, which consists of the intervals
[ 
min
(H
k
)  (d); 
max
(H
k
) + (d)];
wherefH
k
g is the full family of equivalence classes of recurrent vertices,
d is the diameter of the covering, and  ( ) is the modulus of continuity of
the function '.
2. If the diameterd of the covering converges to 0, then the extended spectrum
 
 
and the spectrum of the symbolic image  (G) converge to   in the
Hausdorff metric.
The Hausdorff metric. Let X and Y be subsets of a compact set K and let
 (x;y) be a distance on K. The distance between X and Y is de ned as
dist(X;Y ) = supf (x;Y );  (y;X) : x2X; y2Yg;
where  (x;Y ) = inff (x;y) : y2Yg, If X Y , then  (x;Y ) = 0 and
dist(X;Y ) = supf (y;X) : y2Yg:
Thus, in order to estimate the averaging spectrum of the system, we need to
 nd the spectrum of the equipped symbolic image. This task comes down to
 nding cycles with minimum and maximum averages. It's clear that the search
for such cycles using continuous enumeration is impossible in our conditions,
since during iterative constructions of a symbolic image, the number of cycles
increases sharply. The Theorem 6 allows us to estimate the Morse spectrum
using the technique of the symbolic image of the mappingPf on the projective
bundle.
Let G be a symbolic image of the mapping Pf with respect to a covering
C =fM(i)g of the projective spaceP , letfH
k
g be a complete family of classes
of equivalent recurrent vertices of the graph G: To calculate the spectrum,
we need to transform the function '(x;e) = lnjDf(x)ej on P to a function
a[ij] on the symbolic image G. If i ! j is an edge on G,  xing a point
(x;e) in the cell M(i), we set a[ij] = lnjDf(x)ej. Recall that a periodic path
! =fz
1
;:::;z
p
=z
0
g is a cycle (a simple path) if its verticesz
1
;:::;z
p
are distinct.
The number of simple paths is  nite. Let H be a class of equivalent recurrent
vertices and let
 
min
(H) = minf ( 
j
); j = 1;:::;qg;
 
max
(H) = maxf ( 
j
); j = 1;:::;qg

be the minimum and maximum values of averaging on cycles of the class H:
Since the number of cycles is  nite, the described values are calculated in a
 nite number of steps. To achieve the goal, we can use the linear programming
method of the paper [19] or the least characteristic cycle calculation method,
see [10].
According to the Theorem 5, spectrum of the symbolic image  (G) con-
sists of the intervals [ 
min

); 
max
(H

)]; wherefH
k
g is the complete family of
classes of equivalent recurrent vertices of the symbolic image ofG: The following
theorem is a corollary of Theorems 6.
Theorem 7 The Morse spectrum lies in the extended spectrum of the symbolic
image

min

wherefH
k
g is the complete family of classes of equivalent recurrent vertices of
the symbolic image, d is the diameter of the covering, and  ( ) is the modulus
of continuity of the function ' = lnjDf(x)ej.
From the theorems 1 and 7 it follows
Hyperbolicity Test
Theorem 8 The following statements are equivalent:
1. the diffeomorphism f is hyperbolic on the chain-recurrent set CR;
2. there exists d
0
> 0 such that the extended Morse spectrum of the symbolic
image for a covering (of projective bundle) with maximal diameter d<d
0
does not contain zero.
Thus, the symbolic image of a dynamical system allows us to localize the
chain-recurrent set and check its hyperbolicity. The article [19] contains an
application of the hyperbolicity test.
3 Structural Stability
3.1 De nitions
A qualitative theory of the dynamical systems consists in the geometric de-
scription of a set of trajectories. This leads to the fact that it is necessary to
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.302 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 34Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
determine when the spaces of trajectories of two systems has the same quality
characteristics. It is natural to assume that the change of coordinates trans-
forms the system into its equivalent. In other words, the dynamical system
x
n+1
=f(x
n
) is equivalent to the system y
n+1
=g(y
n
), if there exists a change
of coordinates y = h(x), which maps the trajectories of the  rst system to
the trajectories another system. The most natural change of coordinates is a
homeomorphism. In this case, the equality f(x) = h
 1
(g(h(x))) holds. Thus,
we come to the following de nition.
De nition 7 The diffeomorphisms f : M ! M and g : M ! M are called
topologically equivalent if there exists a homeomorphism h :M!M such that
g h =h f.
This means that the mapping f is converted to g when the coordinates are
changed. In this case, the dynamics of the system x
n+1
=f(x
n
) is transformed
into the dynamics of the system y
n+1
= g(y
n
). If a dynamic system arises in
an application, then its coe cients (parameters) are usually known only ap-
proximately. Therefore, the problem arises of studying the change in dynamics
under small perturbations of the system. It is extremely important to know the
conditions under which the dynamics of the system is conserved under small
perturbations of the model system.
De nition 8 A diffeomorphism f is called structurally stable if there exists a
neighbourhood U of f in the space of diffeomorphisms such that any diffeomor-
phism g from U is topologically equivalent to the diffeomorphism f.
Structural stability is a fundamental property of a dynamical system which
means that the qualitative behaviour of the trajectories is unaffected by small
perturbations.
Alexander Andronov, a specialist in the  eld of electrical engineering, radio-
physics and applied mechanics, was the  rst to initiate the task of studying the
conservation of the dynamics of the system under perturbations. In 1932, he
turned to Lev Pontryagin with a proposal to begin joint scienti c work in this
direction. Their article "Rough Systems" was published in Reports of the USSR
Academy of Sciences in 1937 [2]. An extensive theory of dynamical systems has
grown out of this four-page article. They considered an autonomous system
of differential equations on a two-dimensional disk. It was assumed that the
vector  eld at the boundary is directed strictly inside the disk. It was necessary
to  nd the conditions under which the trajectories of the perturbed system are
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.302 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 35Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
translated by small homeomorphic transformation into the trajectories of the
original system. The described property was called <<system roughness>>. In
order for the system to be rough, it is necessary and su cient that the following
Andronov-Pontryagin conditions are met:
  there are a  nite number of singular points (equilibrium states),
  these singular points have non-zero Lyapunov exponents; that is, they can
be stable and unstable equilibrium states or hyperbolic equilibrium states,
  there are  nitely many periodic trajectories,
  these periodic trajectories have non-zero Lyapunov exponents,
  there are no trajectories (separatrices) connecting hyperbolic equilibrium
states or trajectories beginning and ending in the same hyperbolic state of
equilibrium.
The modern term "structural stability" for the rough systems comes from S.
Lefschetz, see [13]. Until the beginning of the sixties, there was a hope that the
conditions of Andronov-Pontryagin are necessary and su cient for the struc-
tural stability. However, in 1961 S. Smale constructed an example of a struc-
turally stable diffeomorphism on the plane (Smale horseshoe) with an in nite
set of periodic trajectories, see [114]
In the 80-s of the last century, the necessary and su cient conditions for struc-
tural stability were discovered by the efforts of Robin, Robinson and Mane (see
formulation below). This wonderful classic result is abstract in nature, but it
is not very suitable for practical use. It should be noted that modern computer
technology allows us to check the Andronov-Pontryagin conditions. Our goal is
to transform Robin-Robinson-Mane conditions into equivalent conditions that
can be veri ed with a computer.
3.2 Transversality Condition
Letf be a diffeomorphism of a compact manifoldM. To describe the conditions
of structural stability we de ne a stable S(x) and an unstable U(x) subspaces
at each point x:
S(x) = fv2TM(x) : jDf
n
(x)vj! 0, n! +1g;
U(x) = fv2TM(x) : jDf
n
(x)vj! 0, n! 1g;
where TM(x) is the tangent space to M at x.
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.302 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 36Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
De nition 9 We say that the transversality condition is satis ed on the man-
ifold M if
TM(x) =S(x) +U(x)
at any point x2M:
Summarizing the results of J. Robbin [23], C. Robinson [24] and R. Mane [15]
we can state the following theorem.
Theorem 9 The diffeomorphism f is structurally stable if and only if the
transversality condition is satis ed on the manifold M.
Theorem 9 describes the necessary and su cient conditions. The practical ap-
plication of this result is limited by the di culties of veri cation of the transver-
sality condition.
Relationship between the transversality condition and hyperbolicity.
Suppose that the transversality condition is satis ed and the diffeomorphism f
is hyperbolic on the invariant set  . Then the invariant subspaces E
s
(x) and
E
u
(x) continuously depend on x2   and dimE
s
+ dimE
u
=dimM: There-
fore, the dimension of these subspaces is constant on each connected component
of the set  . The differential contracts exponentially on E
s
and extends expo-
nentially on E
u
. It is clear that E
s
(x) S(x) and E
u
(x) U(x).
Theorem 10 [4, 14] If the transversality condition is satis ed, then
  the set   =fx2M : TM(x) =S(x) U(x)g is closed and invariant;
  the diffeomorphism f is hyperbolic on   and S(x) = E
s
(x), U(x) =
E

  the chain-recurrent set CR lies in  .
3.3 Dual Differential
Lethv;ui be the scalar product (inner product) in the tangent spaceTM andA
be a linear mapping, then the conjugate mapping A
 
is de ned by the equality
hAv;ui =hv;A
 
ui:
If A is a matrix, then A
 
is the transposed matrix. The matrix (A
 
)
 1
is the
inverse to the transposed matrix. The dual differential is determined according
to the formula
b
Df(x) = ((Df(x))
 
)

The dual differential acts from TM(x) to TM(f(x)). In local coordinates,
the elements of the Jacobi matrix Df(x) = A(x) are partial derivatives a

The next theorem asserts the equivalence of the hyperbolicity of the differential
and of the dual differential.
Theorem 11 [4, 26]. A diffeomorphism f is hyperbolic on a chain-recurrent
set CR if and only if the dual differential
b
Df is hyperbolic on CR. Moreover,
the stable subspace

of

Df perpendicular to the stable subspaceE

is perpendicular to the unstable subspace E

The spectrum of the dual differential  (
b
Df) is de ned as the averaging spec-
trum of the function
 (x;e) = lnj
b
Df(x)ej
over the periodic pseudotrajectories of the system (12).
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.302 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 38Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
Consider the covering C(P ) of the projective bundle and construct a sym-
bolic image G of the mapping P (
b
Df). Choosing a point (x
i
;e
i
) in each cell
M(i), we construct a function a[ij] = (x
i
;e
i
) on the edges of the symbolic
imageG. We can  nd the spectrum  (G) of the symbolic image. By using the
modulus of continuity of the function (x;e) we can  nd the the extension of
the spectrum  (G). From the theorems 1, 7, 8, and 11 it follows
Theorem 12 The next statements are equivalent:
  the dual differential
b
Df is hyperbolic on the chain-recurrent set CR(f),
  the spectrum of  (
b
Df) of the dual differential does not contain zero,
  there exists d
0
> 0 such that the extended spectrum of the symbolic image
of the dual differential with respect to a covering C(P ) with a maximum
diameter d<d
0
does not contain zero.
De nition 11 [4, 28] The dual differential is said to have only trivial bounded
trajectories if any bounded trajectory
f(x
n+1
;v
n+1
) = (f(x
n
);
b
Df(x
n
)v
n
); n2Zg
is a zero trajectory, i.e. v
n
= 0:
The following theorem describes the transversality condition in terms of the
dual differential, see Proposition 8.46 in [4].
Theorem 13 [4, 15] The transversality condition holds if and only if the dual
differential has only trivial bounded trajectories.
At  rst glance, it seems that to verify the described property of the dual differ-
ential is just as di cult as to verify the transversality condition. However, we
will show that the absence of nontrivial bounded trajectories can be construc-
tively veri ed by using the symbolic image of the dual differential P
b
Df.
3.4 Equivalent Conditions
Suppose that the spectrum of the dual differential does not contain zero, then
 (
b
Df) consists of two parts: the positive part  
+
and the negative part  
 
.
The spectrum consists of the segments [a;b], each of which is generated by a
component of the chain-recurrent set 
 of the mapping P
b
Df. Hence, each
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.302 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 39Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
component 
 of the chain-recurrent set CR(P
b
Df) receives the sign <<plus>>
or <<minus>>, depending on which segment it generates | positive or negative.
In this case, the chain-recurrent set is divided into two parts CR
+
and CR
 
so that CR
+
includes all the positive components and CR
 
includes all the
negative components.
Let e be the point of the projective bundle, let E(e) be the one-dimensional
subspace of the tangent bundle spanned bye. Ifv2TM is the tangent vector,
then the projection Pv =e is the point of the projective bundle. By construc-
tion, the spectrum  (
b
Dfj
E(CR
+
)
) is positive, and the spectrum  (
b
Dfj
E(CR
 
)
)
is negative. The sets CR
+
and CR
 
are called positive and negative (respec-
tively) chain-recurrent sets of the dual differential on the projective bundle. We
denote
b

x
: lim

(x)v = 0g;
and P
b
S, P
b
U are the projections of these subspaces into the projective bundle.
Theorem 14 [4, 7, 27] The dual differential has only trivial bounded trajecto-
ries if and only if the projectionsP
b
U is an attractor, andP
b
S is its dual repeller
on the projective bundle.
The theorem was proved by I.U. Bronstein (see [4, p. 132]) and, independently,
D. Salamon, E. Zehnder (see [27, Theorem 2.7]). If a diffeomorphism is struc-
turally stable, then from the Theorems 9, 10, 11, 12 it follows that the spectrum
of the dual differential does not contain zero.
Consider a diffeomorphism f whose dual differential spectrum does not
contain zero. Suppose a trajectory   =f(x
n
;e
n
) = P
b
Df
n
(x;e); n2 Zg is
not chain-recurrent. Recall that the ff-limit set of a trajectory is a limit set
of the trajectory points for n !  1, The !-limit set of a trajectory is a
limit set of the trajectory points for n! +1. Since the trajectory   is not
chain-recurrent, then its ff-limit set lies in some component 

1
of the chain
recurrence set and its !-limit set lies in another component of 

2
. We can say
that the trajectory   starts at 

1
and ends at 

2
. Let C =fM(i)g be a closed
covering of the projective bundleP andG is the symbolic image of the mapping
P
b
Df. We construct a function a[ij] on the edges of the graph G by setting
fa[ij] = lnj
b
Df(x
i
)e
i
jg, where (x
i
;e
i
)2 M(i). The extended spectrum of the
symbolic image ofG contains the spectrum of the dual differential. According to
Theorem 6, if the diameter of the covering converges to zero, then the extended

spectrum converges to the spectrum of the dual differential in the Hausdorff
metric. Let the diameter of the covering be so small such that the extended
spectrum does not contain zero. The next proposition follows from the t heorem
142 in [20].
Proposition 3 LetH be a class of equivalent recurrent vertices onG and [a;b]
is an extended spectrum of the class H. Then there are positive constants K
 
and K

De nition 12 Suppose that the spectrum of the dual differential does not con-
tain zero. We say that there exists a connection CR

trajectory   of the map P

Proof. Su ciency. Suppose that the spectrum of the dual differential does
not contain zero and there is no link CR
+
! CR
 
. According to Theorems
9 and 13, we have to show that the dual differential has only trivial bounded
trajectories. If the spectrum of the dual differential does not contain zero, then
the chain-recurrent setCR(P
b
Df) decomposes into the sum of the positive and
negative parts,
CR(P

Since the spectrum of  (
b
Df) is closed, there exists a segment [  ; ];   > 0,
which does not contain points of the spectrum.

k
g is the projection of the trajectory   into the projec-
tive bundle P:
If P  is a chain-recurrent trajectory, then P  lies in CR
+
+ CR
 
and,
hence,  is hyperbolic and unbounded. Suppose thatP  is not a chain-recurrent
trajectory. Then its ff- and !-limit sets lie in CR
+
+CR
 
. We say that P 
starts atCR
+
, if itsff-limit set lies inCR

, and we say thatP  starts atCR

if its ff-limit set lies in CR
 
. Similarly, P  ends at CR
+
, if the !-limit set lies
in CR

, and P  ends at CR
 
, if the !-limit set lies in CR

Let P  end in CR

for the positive semitrajectory, where b    < 0 and p > 0. In this case,
the positive semitrajectory

is bounded. In the same way, we can show that
if P  starts at CR
+
, then the negative semitrajectory  
 
is bounded, and if
P  starts at CR
 
, then the negative semitrajectory  
 
is unbounded. Thus, a
nonzero trajectory   is bounded if and only if P  starts at CR
+
and ends at
CR
 
: In this case, we have the connection CR

!CR
 
. This contradicts the
assumptions of the theorem. Hence, the trajectory   is unbounded. Thus, any
nonzero trajectory of the dual differential is unbounded. Then it follows from
the Theorems 9 and 13 that the diffeomorphism f is structurally stable.
Necessity. Assume thatf is structurally stable. According to the Theorems
9 and 10, f is hyperbolic on the chain-recurrent set CR(f). By the Theorem
11, the spectrum of the dual differential does not contain zero and, due to its
closure, the spectrum does not contain some segment [  ; ];   > 0. The
spectrum is divided into two parts

and  
 
: Similarly, the chain-recurrent
setCR(P

Df) of the dual differential also splits into two parts CR

as described above. According to Theorem 13, a dual differential should have
only trivial bounded trajectories.

3.5 Veri cation of Structural Stability
We will show that the conditions of Theorems 15 can be constructively veri ed
by means of the symbolic image of the dual differential. Consider the symbolic
image G of the dual differential P
b
Df : P ! P on the projective bundle.
Suppose that the spectrum of the dual differential does not contain zero. Then
there exists d
0
> 0 such that for any covering of the projective bundle with a
diameterd<d

the extended spectrum of the symbolic image does not contain
zero. In this case, each class of equivalent recurrent vertices H
k
receives an
extended spectral interval
[a

min
(H

max
(H

which is positive for a

known that the set

[
M(i) : i2H

De nition 13 We say that on the symbolic image of G there exists a connec-
tion H
+
!H
 
if there exists an admissible path from H
+
to H
 
.
Theorem 16 A diffeomorphism f is structurally stable if and only if there
exists d
0
> 0 such that for any covering C of the projective bundle P with
diameterd<d
0
the extended spectrum of symbolic image of the dual differential
does not contain zero and there is no link H
+
!H
 
.
Proof. Su ciency. Suppose that there existsd
0
> 0 such that for the covering
C(P ) of the projective bundle of diameter d < d
0
, the extended spectrum of
the symbolic image G(P
b
Df) of the dual differential does not contain zero and
there is no link H
+
! H
 
. Let us  x the described covering and construct
a symbolic image. Then according to Theorems 12, the spectrum of the dual
differential does not contain zero and the dual differential is hyperbolic on the
chain-recurrent set CR(f). The chain-recurrent set CR(P
b
Df) is divided into
two parts CR
+
+CR
 
, the set
P

[
M(i) : i2H

g
is a neighbourhood of CR

and the set
P
 
=f
[
M(j) : j2H
 
g
is a neighbourhood of CR
 
:
Let us show by contradiction that there is no link CR
+
!CR
 
. In fact, if
there exists a trajectory   =f(x
k

k
)g of the mappings P
b
Df, which starts at
CR

and ends atCR
 
, then  generates an admissible path! =fz

M(z

)g fromH

toH
 
onG. This gives the linkH
+
!H
 
, which contradicts
the assumption of the theorem. So there is no link CR
+
! CR
 
. From the
Theorems 15 it follows that the diffeomorphism f is structurally stable.
Necessity. Let the diffeomorphism f be structurally stable. Then from
the Theorems 15 it follows that the spectrum of the dual differential does not
contain zero and there is no connection CR
+
! CR
 
. From the Theorem
12 it follows that there exists d
1
> 0 such that the extended spectrum of the
symbolic image of the dual differential for a covering with a diameter d < d
1
does not contain zero. The classes of equivalent recurrent vertices are divided
into positive and negative parts H

and H
 
, so that the set

and let P

projection of the trajectory (x

where e

=v=jvj. The !-limit set of this trajectory lies in some component of
the chain-recurrent set CR(P
b
Df) =CR

. The equality
lim
n!+1
b
Df
n
(x)v = 0
holds if only the !-limit set of the trajectory (x

) lies in CR
 
. The stable
manifold of the set CR
 
is of the form
W
s
(CR
 
) =f(x;e) : P

Hence, the stable manifold W
s
(CR
 
) coincides with the projection P
b
S. Sim-
ilarly P
b
U = W
u
(CR

). From the Theorems 9, 13, 14 it follows that P
b
E

an attractor, and P
b

is its dual repellor for the dual differential. Thus, the
unstable manifoldW
u
(CR

) is an attractor, and the stable manifoldW
s
(CR
 
)
is its dual repellor. It follows that there exists d

> 0 such that every symbolic
imageG; for a covering with a diameterd<d

where there are zeros under the diagonal, the diagonal zeros correspond to
nonrecurrent (transient) vertices, the diagonal blocks (L

Such transition matrix only admits paths from L

Structural Stability Test.
Structural stability can be veri ed by the following method:
1) the dual differential
b
Df :TM!TM is constructed;
2) a coveringC of the projective bundleP is chosen and the symbolic image
G is constructed for the dual differential;
3) the strong componentsfH
k
g of the symbolic image G are determined;
4) a functiona[ij] on the edges of the graphG is constructed for the function
' = lnj
b
Df(x)ej on the projective bundle;
5) the extended spectrum of the symbolic image of G is found;
6) if the extended spectrum does not contain zero, then the positive and
negative classes of recurrent vertices H
+
and H
 
is determined;
7) the absence of a linkH
+
!H
 
is checked. If such a link is absent, then
the diffeomorphism f structurally stable.
Theorem 16 guarantees that if the diffeomorphism f is structurally stable,
then there exists a su ciently small diameter of the covering for which the
described method checks the structural stability.
Computer implementation.
At present, all algorithms for computer implementation of the presented
method are known. Let us consider these graph theory algorithms and their
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.302 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 46Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
applications to dynamical systems. The book [20] and the article [3] describe
the computer technique for constructing symbolic images. Please note that
these calculations were performed on personal computers and do not require
the use of supercomputers. The main technical di culty is the huge number of
coverage cells.
We start from the localization of chain-recurrent set. This process is de-
scribed in the book [20]. Localization is reduced to calculating classes of equiv-
alent recurrent vertices H
k
(strong connected components) of symbolic image.
There are many algorithms (see the book [31]) for solving this problem and
the Tarjan algorithm (see the paper [32]) is the most popular of them. The
article [3] presents the results of localization of chain-recurrent sets for 2- and
3-dimensional dynamical systems with chaotic dynamics.
The next task is to determine the extended spectrum of the symbolic im-
age. The solution is reduced to calculating the largest (smallest) average over
periodic simple paths of the classes H
k
. These paths are named the extreme
cycles. There are many algorithms for  nding extreme cycles on a graph (see
[5, 10, 6]), and Romanovsky (see [25]) were the  rst to solve this problem. The
article [19] describes the results of a computer test for the hyperbolicity of a
nontrivial chain-recurrent set which is homeomorphic to a Cantor set. The
article calculates the extended Morse spectrum that does not contain zero.
The last task is to check the absence of the path H
+
!H
 
. The solution
is based on topological sorting of the symbolic image (see the book [31]). The
topological sorting determines the renumbering of vertices so that the transition
matrix of the symbolic image G takes the form

where each diagonal block

either corresponds to the equivalence class of re-
current verticesH

, or corresponds to some nonrecurrent vertex (block consists
of one zero), under the diagonal blocks are only zeros. With this numbering of
vertices, only paths from the upper blocks (classes) to the lower blocks (classes)
are possible, which allows us to check the absence of path H
+
!H
 
.
According to the Theorem 16, for a structurally stable diffeomorphism f
there existsd

ity for any covering with cell diameterd<d
0
. IfC is a covering with arbitrary
diameter, then a  nite number of subdivisions gives the covering with cell diam-
eterd<d
0
. Thus, the described method implements a constructive veri cation
of the structural stability in a  nite number of steps.
