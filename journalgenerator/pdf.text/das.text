Abstract 
This article deals with anti-synchronization between different hyperchaotic systems such as Lu system 
and Newton-Leipnik system; and Newton-Leipnik system and Rossler system using adaptive control 
method. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, the anti synchronization between a pair of hyperchaotic 
systems with fully unknown parameters are derived. An adaptive control law and a parameter update 
rule for unknown parameters are designed such that the hyperchaotic Newton-Leipnik system is 
controlled to be the hyperchaotic Lu system and hyperchaotic Rossler system is controlled to be the 
hyperchaotic Newton-Leipnik system. Numerical simulation results which are carried out using 
MATLAB, show that the adaptive control method is effective, easy to implement and reliable for anti-
synchronizing of the considered hyperchaotic systems.  
 
Keywords: Hyperchaos, Lu system, Newton-Leipnik system, Rossler system, Anti-synchronization,

1. Introduction 
In the past, modeling was restricted mainly to linear systems which would have been tackled using 
various analytical methods. But with the advent of powerful computers and related softwares, it is Differential Equations and Control Processes, № 4, 2012

made possible to tackle nonlinear systems. Nonlinearity is the heart of dynamical systems is 
deterministic and changes with time. The applications of dynamical systems have nowadays spread to 
a wide spectrum of disciplines including science, engineering, biology, sociology etc. Study and 
analysis of nonlinear dynamics have gained immense popularity during the last few decades due to its 
important feature of any real-time dynamical system. In nonlinear systems, a small change in a 
parameter can lead to sudden and dramatic changes in both the qualitative and quantitative behavior of 
the system. Sometimes these may give rise to the complex behavior called chaos. In dynamical 
systems, the term chaos is applied to deterministic systems that are aperiodic and that exhibit sensitive 
dependence on initial conditions and parameter variations. Sensitivity means that a small change in the 
initial state will lead to progressively larger changes in later system states. The presence of chaos in 
physical systems has been extensively demonstrated and is very common. The main property of 
chaotic dynamics is its critical sensitivity to initial conditions, which is responsible for initially 
neighboring trajectories separating from each other exponentially in the course of time. The concept of 
chaos has been used to explain how systems that should be subject to known laws of physics may be 
predictable in the short term but are apparently random on a longer time scale. 
A Hyperchaotic system is usually classified as a chaotic system with more than one positive Lyapunov 
exponent. Though the positive largest Lyapunov exponent does not indicate chaos as the negative 
largest Lyapunov exponent does not indicate stability [1], it is a fact that with the advent of computers 
and the increasing facility to perform a number of experiments for calculating characteristic exponents 
for the sake construction of various numerical characteristics attractors, the researchers working in 
dynamical systems consider that the instability of the solutions of the system occurs at this largest 
positive characteristic exponent [2]. Combine with one null exponent along the flow and one negative 
exponent to ensure the boundness of the solution. It means that hyperchaotic systems have more 
complex dynamical behaviours which can be used to improve the security of a chaotic communication 
system. Firstly, Hyperchaotic system introduced by Rossler [3] in 1979. Controlling synchronization 
of hyperchaotic system have attracted a great deal of attention from various ﬁelds and become a 
challenging work. 
Since the idea of synchronizing chaotic systems was introduced by Pecora and Carroll [4] in 1990, 
they showed that it is possible to synchronize chaotic systems through a simple coupling. 
Synchronization of chaotic dynamical systems has been intensively studied by many researchers [5-8] 
and has attracted a great deal of interest in various field due to its important applications in ecological 
system [9], physical system [10], chemical system [11], modeling brain activity, system identification, 
pattern recognition phenomena and secure communications [12-14] etc. 
In the recent years several different types of synchronization schemes have been proposed, such as 
time delay feedback approach [15], adaptive control [16-23], active control [24], back-stepping design Differential Equations and Control Processes, № 4, 2012  
 
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal  94 
method [25] and sliding mode control [26] etc, have been successfully applied to chaos 
synchronization. The concept of synchronization can be extended to generalized synchronization [27], 
complete synchronization [28], lag synchronization [29], phase synchronization [30], anti-
synchronization [31], projective synchronization [32], modified projective synchronization [33] and 
hybrid synchronization [34] etc. 
The control of chaotic systems is to design state feedback control laws that stabilizes the chaotic 
systems around the unstable equilibrium points. Adaptive control technique is used when the system 
parameters are unknown.  In an adaptive method control law and a parameter update rule for unknown 
parameters are designed in such a way that the hyperchaotic response system is controlled to be the 
hyperchaotic master system. The idea of anti-synchronization is observed in periodic hyperchaotic 
systems, which is a phenomenon in which the state variables of synchronized systems with different 
initial values have the same absolute values but opposite signs. The sums of two signals are expected 
to converge to zero when anti-synchronization occurs. 
Most of the studies in synchronization involve two identical /non-identical systems under the 
hypotheses that all the parameters of the master and slave systems are known a prior, a controller is 
constructed with the known parameters and systems are free from external perturbations. But in 
practical situations the uncertainties like parameter mismatch and external disturbances may destroy 
the synchronization and even break it. So it is necessary to design an adaptive controller and parameter 
update law for control and synchronization of chaotic systems consisting of unknown parameters to get 
rid of internal and external noises. From the literature survey, it is seen that with the development of 
nonlinear control theory, nowadays adaptive anti-synchronization method has become very much 
effective to control and synchronize of chaotic and hyperchaotic systems both with unknown 
parameters and external disturbances. This has motivated the authors to do significant study of the 
adaptive anti-synchronization between two pair of two hyperchaotic systems all having unknown 
parameters. 
Recently, many authors have studied the control and synchronization for the chaotic and hyperchaotic 
systems. Zhang et al. [16] studied adaptive synchronization between two different chaotic systems 
with unknown parameters. Hu et al. [17] proposed adaptive control for anti-synchronization of Chua’s 
chaotic system. In 2008, Salarieh and Shahrokhi [18] investigated adaptive synchronization of two 
different chaotic systems with time varying unknown parameters. In 2008, Wu et al. [19] proposed a 
scheme to synchronize hyperchaotic Chen system and generalized Henon-Heiles System of different 
structures via adaptive control. Zhang and Zhu [20] proposed anti-synchronization of two different 
hyperchaotic systems via active and adaptive control methods. Mossa et al. [21] investigated adaptive 
anti-synchronization of chaotic systems with fully unknown parameters in 2010. Mossa et al. [22] have 
investigated adaptive anti-synchronization of two identical and different hyperchaotic systems with Differential Equations and Control Processes, № 4, 2012

uncertain parameters in 2010.  In 2011, Li et al. [23] proposed Complete (anti-)synchronization of 
chaotic systems with fully uncertain parameters by adaptive  control.  
In this article, the authors have studied adaptive anti-synchronization between different hyperchaotic 
systems using adaptive control and parameter update rule. This article has been organized as follows. 
In Section 2, adaptive anti-synchronization method is discussed. In section 3, the system descriptions 
of Lu, Newton-Leipnik and Rossler systems are given. In Sections 4 and 5, adaptive anti-
synchronization between Lu and Newton-Leipnik hyperchaotic systems; and Newton-Leipnik and 
Rossler hyperchaotic systems are discussed respectively. In Section 6, the conclusion of the work is 
presented.

With the choice of the adaptive control law and parameter update rule above for unknown parameters 
are designed, the time derivative of V along the solution in equation (3) will be smaller than zero. In 
other words, the error vector will approach to zero as time goes infinite and from Lyapunov stability 
theory [35], the states of the slave system and projected master system are asymptotically anti-
synchronized.

when controls are applied, the two systems will approach for anti-synchronization for any initial

5.1 Numerical simulation and results 
We verify and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and discuss the simulation result 
for the anti-synchronization behavior of two different hyperchaotic Newton-Leipnik and Rossler 
systems. In numerical simulations, the parameters of hyperchaotic Newton-Leipnik and Rossler 
systems are taken as ) 01 . 0 , 8 . 0 , 175 . 0 , 4 . 0 ( ) , , , (  d c b a and ) 05 . 0 , 5 . 0 , 3 , 25 . 0 ( ) , , , (  s r q p

6. Conclusion 
The present investigation has attained accomplishment in two significant capacities.  First it is  
successfully carried out the study of anti-synchronization between Lu and Newton-Leipnik 
hyperchaotic systems, and Newton-Leipnik and Rossler hyperchaotic systems with uncertain 
parameters using adaptive control method. Adaptive controller and parameters update law are designed 
properly to anti-synchronize two different pair of hyperchaotic systems based on the Lyapunov 
stability theorem. The second one is the numerical simulation, which are carried out using Runge-
Kutta method calls for appreciation to show that the method is reliable and effective for adaptive anti-
synchronization of nonlinear dynamical systems.
