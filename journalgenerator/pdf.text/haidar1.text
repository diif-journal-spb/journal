Abstract
The boundary value approach to dynamic optimization is still an active area
of research in many domains of process engineering. The particular domain of in-
terest in the present work is a certain nonlinear optimization problem, constrained
by a 3D neutron diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) and controlled, in
time, by the boundary conditions. An analytical solution to the associated linear
boundary value problem (BVP), which is a principal activity of this optimiza-
tion, has been reached in 2019 by this author, based on application of an additive
separation of variables (ASOV) principle, and was published in the International
Journal of Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations.
The sole objective of this paper is to examine and verify the consistency of the
ASOV method in solving the BVP of this optimization process. The justiﬁcation
of this method is based on reversibility of a pertaining generalized Euclidean
transformation, and on asserting this reversibility in the context of an exterior
differential framework for the BVP.

1 Introduction
The panoramic picture of the research, addressed in this paper, overlooks a non-
linear dynamic optimization [10, 12] problem, constrained [9] by (i) a source-free
3D neutron diffusion PDE and (ii) parametrized time control in some boundary
equality constraints, [12, 14, 16, 20], of an associated linear BVP. The presented
research is a contribution to the boundary value approach to dynamic optimiza-
tion, reported in [12], which distinctively employs explicit parametrization, [10,
12]. The motivation for it comes from the fact that dynamical neutron ﬂuxes
happen to penetrate a (B/Gd)-loaded cancerous region better [11] than alterna-
tive stationary ﬂuxes. A result that brings about a possible improvement in the
nonlinear therapeutic objectives, to be optimized.
The present paper focuses, however, only on one detail of this picture, namely
on the consistency of the analytical solvability of this dynamical BVP by the
ASOV method, reported in [9]. It is well known that the availability of an analyt-
ical differentiable solution, [9], to the posing unique BVP is of crucial importance,
[24, 27]. It happens to allow for an explicit nonlinearly parametrized Pareto op-
timization, [10, 12], that is employable instead of alternative optimization via
Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle [24], or Bellman’s Dynamic Programming, with
their implicit-only parametrization and their other intrinsic diﬃculties [29].
The 3D dynamical BVP of neutron cancer therapy, reported in [9], models
the irradiation of a cancerous region R of an R[ ( [ 
[f) composite in
a patient by three orthogonal time-modulated beams of thermal neutrons. Its
dynamical output variable is the neutron ﬂux  (r;t);which satisﬁes the following
monoenergetic volumetric source-free neutron diffusion PDE

The Neumann BC(ii) is also nonhomogeneous, but periodic in time.

generally speaking, is a Lie group, [23], and a Lie algebra is always associated with
a Lie group. Moreover, a Lie algebra, having at least one inﬁnitesimal generator,
has a given dimension, and whenever the Lie algebra is solvable, the BVP is
solvable. So the existence of a symmetry group for (6) can possibly be utilized to

Relation (7) indicates that symmetry adapted solutions to partial differential
equations (PDE’s) from knowledge of their Lie symmetries is an example of or-
thogonalvariableseparation, seee.g. [22]. Inparticular, W.Millerhashighlighted
in [22] many points of contact between separation of variables methods and Lie
symmetries of a PDE, including their possible ties with the mathematics of the
rather old St¨ ackel form, [26]. It should be noted, however, that symmetry-based
methods have not been widely used, [4], for solving BVP’s. The reason being that
the pertaining boundary conditions (BC’s) are usually not invariant under most
similarity transformations, i.e. they do not admit the symmetries of the governing
PDE’s. Probably, the ﬁrst rigorous deﬁnition of Lie’s invariance for BVP’s was
formulated by G. W. Bluman, [4], in 1974. In fact there are still many realistic
BVP’s that cannot be solved using any deﬁnition, [2], of Lie’s invariance of a BVP.
Hence deﬁnitions involving more general types of symmetries, like Lie-B¨ acklund
non-point symmetries, are currently being investigated.
Despite all the previously stated, solving BVP’s by separation of variables is
both an art and science, which may seem to be only adhoc in nature. For linear

PDE’s, a multivariate solution  (x), in separated variable form, has widely been
attempted by applying representations of  (x) as products or sums of single
variable functions P

respectively.
The form (9) is multiplicative separation of variables, while (10) is additive.
It is moreover straightforward to verify that each of them can only apply iff

The theoretical basis for this separation of variables procedure happens to be
constrained three fold. The ﬁrst restriction on this basis comes from the possible
nonuniqueness of  (x) satisfying (6). The second constraint is tied to whether
the form (9), (10) or their other variants can satisfy the BVP. In this respect, it is
well known that the additive separation of variables does not work for the Laplace
equation

; as it cannot match the usual notion of a
potential-it does not die at spatial inﬁnity. In contrast, the multiplicative separa-
tion of variables works for this singular BVP. Then, the third constraint emerges
from the approximate nature of representing  (x) in any of the separated vari-
able forms. Ultimately, the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which
solves a more general form of Hilbert’s thirteenth problem, [19], states that every
continuous multivariate@(x) can be expressed as a ﬁnite composition of outer,

This fundamental theorem which is also applicable to the solution  (x) of (6),
has however a number of other simpler variants. A further, even simpler situation,
can occur when x

separability.
Incidentally, the same Laplace transform approach had earlier been used in [8] for
solving a 1D version of this BVP. It should be noted, moreover, that this 3D BVP
is of unique symmetry due to its having the same kind of BC’s in each of the
three spatial variables, which can be of different spans. Actually, our aim in this
work is to establish the consistency of this principle for solving this particular 3D
BVP by exterior calculus arguments, without invoking the heavy machinery of
Lie group symmetry.
The exterior analysis of the solvability of dynamical BVP’s addresses vari-
ations of the BVP solution over differential volume elements dt^ dr; with the
wedge properties : d ^ d  = d ^ d ; d ^ d  = 0; for any   and  : An
analysis which is a natural geometric setting, as to be shown in sections 2 and 3,
from which to initiate a consistency assessment of the ASOV principle, enabling
a more concise and explicit evaluation than by an alternative symmetry-based
assessment. A more detailed account on exterior differential analysis is provided
in Appendix A.
The paper is organized as follows. After this introduction, section 2 reports
on the main result of this work on separability and solvability of BVP’s in general.
In section 3, we review the ASOV solution of the 3D dynamical BVP of NCT,
reported in [9]. Finally in section 4 we employ an exterior calculus approach to
establish the consistency of the arguments for the ASOV principle in solving the
considered BVP.
2 Solvability and additive separability
Recently in [25] Ramsey et al. studied the relation of symmetry to the multi-
plicative separability of the neutron diffusion equation. Using Lie group analysis,
they found that the traditional space-time multiplicatively separable solution of
the neutron diffusion BVP corresponds to time translation and ﬂux scaling sym-
metries. In 1971, using the language of differential forms, Harrison and Estbrook,
[13], formulated an alternative approach to traditional symmetry analysis meth-

ods. In this "isovectors" approach, all differential equations being analyzed are
recast as exterior differential systems (EDS), and analysis of acting operators
takes place in a manifold spanned by all independent and dependent variables
of the associated BVP. An approach that is intended for applications where Lie
symmetry analysis turns out to be prohibitively complicated or not to produce
conclusive results.
The 3D dynamical BVP of neutron cancer therapy, of present interest, acts
on a neutron diffusional ﬂux
(13)   =  (r;t) =  (x;y;z; t);
and may, in general be transformed, via  of (8), by any kind of separation of
variables. The associated  

nonsingular,  

(0) = 0; operator is symbolic in its
action of rearranging and redimensioning of the mapped vectors. The ASOV,
(12), in particular, can be expressed here via

This  happens remarkably to be closed under addition (of   and 	) and
under scalar multiplication (of c by   ), i.e. it is a linear  7!  transformation:
A linearity that obviously does not hold for multiplicative separation of variables;
and is a reason for the focus of attention in this paper only on the ASOV trans-
formation (14).
As a matter of notation, we shall refer to the BVP’s (6) and (7) by
BVP(<;L;B) and BVP(<;G;Q);respectively:Now we are able to advance the
following basic results of this work.

;which is almost always reversible.
A transformation of the type (18) forms a group ( under the usual compo-
sition of generalized transformations) called an aﬃne transformation group, [17],
denoted as=
2
. Moreover, one would expect an aﬃne group to consist of geomet-
rical actions like "translations", "rotations" and "reﬂections" in R
2
: Indeed, such
Euclidean transformations preserve the degree of subjected curves, thus mapping
a "circle" to a "circle", preserve the ratio of distances, thus mapping centers of
circles to centers of circles and preserve contact between existing curves. One can,
therefore, claim that

of (17) also form an aﬃne group, can only be a rough approximation,
that calls for a deeper theoretical veriﬁcation.
Anyhow, and without such a veriﬁcation, if the system BVP (15) is Lie sym-
metry solvable, i.e. its algebra is solvable, then the system (15) itself, or its
equivalent (17), are solvable. Moreover, solvability of (17) means solvability of

The expected complexity of solving a Lie symmetry algebra for the posing
BVP (6) and its possible nonuniqueness motivates avoiding it by means of the
simpler substitute result that follows.
Theorem 1 (Analysis-Synthesis) Let a solution   to a BVP(<;L;B) of
(6) be analyzable,   !  ; by means of the ASOV transformation 
 1
of
(14), with an accompanying nonsingular operator  

transforming (6) to a system
BVP(<;G;Q)of (15). If this system is solvable for   , and can be synthesized

then  is additionally reversible to a solution   =( ) of the original BVP.
Proof: According to [21], a linear operator   is said to be symmetric for the
BVP(<;L;B) if
1.   :<!<;automorphic,
2.  L =L  ;commutative,
3.  B = B  ;commutative.
Obviously, the operators commuting with a given operator form a group. Let
 
L
and  
B
stand for the group of operators commuting withL and B respec-
tively, then the group   =  
<
\  
L
\  
B
is the symmetry group, [21], of the
BVP(<;L;B);where  
<
is the automorphism group of<:It is rather straightfor-
ward to verify that  

in (14), of the ASOV method, satisﬁes the properties of an
 :
Moreover if  

is a symmetric operator for BVP(<;L;B) and  
 1

is a symmet-
ric operator for BVP(<;G;Q); then BVP(<;L;B) and BVP(<;G;Q) are sym-
metries of each other. Consequently, BVP(<;L;B) and BVP(<;G;Q) can have
the same solution, which is a necessary condition for reversibility of ; deﬁned in
(14).
Finally,

cannot exist if  does not exist. So the contrary can not be
true. 
It should be noted that  of theorem 1 is not restricted to the ASOV trans-
formation (14) but applies also to any other variant of it. Distinctively,

could
e.g. involve some algebra with wedge products on associated manifolds; as to be
illustrated in section 4.

Clearly the unique symmetry of this 3D BVP ( due to its having the same
kind of BC’s in each of the three spatial variables, which can be of different spans)
should facilitate the application of the ASOV principle for the solution. Hence in
the associated manifold, the ASOV principle (11) allows for writing
(21)  (x;y;z;t) = (x;t) + (y;t) +  (z;t);
where each of (x;t), (y;t) and  (z;t) can satisfy simpler BCs than  (x;y;z;t):

All these three BVPs , now with nonhomogeneous PDF’s, are structurally
identical and coupled by means of the unknown  (t) and  (t) functions. They
contain yet unknown individual initial conditions '(x),;(y) and ?(z) in their
temporal nonhomogeneous Dirichlet’s BC (iii).
The existence of a unique solution to the posing BVP, via the ASOV principle
(9), turns out to require the imposition of an additional "complementarity"-like
condition that
(27)  (0;t) = (0;t) =  (0;t):
This is a physically quite reasonable condition, see [9], equivalent to the con-
tinuity of the neutron ﬂux (or density) through the (0; 0; 0) corner interface of
R.

Because of the linearity of the nonhomogeneous PDE in (8) and of its asso-
ciated BC’s, we may determine '( ) by the following boundary decomposition
principle. Consider ﬁrst a steady state neutron diffusional process generated only
by the stationary term (m = 0 mode) of the Neumann BC(ii). Since the two
remaining BCs are time-independent and so are the coeﬃcients

The solution'( ) of the auxiliary BVP can be derived in detail via formula
(32) in [9] which contains the unknown coupling factor  : This'( ) can be sub-
stituted back into BC(iii) of (26) to complete its statement prior to its subsequent
solution for ( ;t) by means of the Laplace transformation in the t domain. In
a similar fashion;(  y) can be determined via (49) of [9] and to containF = (0);
while?(  z) contains (  +F);via (67) of [9]. These   andFcoupling factors are
shown to be computable by means of the nonlinear process (71) of [9].
Furthermore, invertible Laplace transforms of the coupling functions  (t)
and (t) turn out also to be computable by a modal expansion approach via the
complex nonlinear process (94) of [9]. Both of the nonlinear processes (71) and
(94) are actually based on (27). Then the entire ASOV solution for this BVP is
obtained, via repeated inversions of Laplace transforms, in the closed analytical
form reported in [9].

The system (35)-(38) is a Grassman algebraic system (whose product is the
wedge product) and its differential forms are mathematical objects that represent
inﬁnitesimal volumes of inﬁnitesimal parallelepipeds and so can be integrated
over volumes and higher order manifolds in a way that generalizes line integrals
from calculus. They interestingly happen also to be common ingredients with
inﬁnitesimal Lie group symmetries.

or

It should be noted however that the  ;   and   variables are of auxiliary
nature, and do not appear explicitly in the original PDE.

These facts, which satisfy the conditions of Theorem 1, establish the correct-
ness of the ASOV principle in solving the 3D dynamical BVP of neutron cancer
therapy. At this point, it should be underlined that:
i) The ASOV solution to the present neutron diffusion BVP is the only
existing closed form analytical solution to this newly formulated problem.
ii) The alternative to ASOV hypothetical method of analytical solution could
be a multiplicative separation of variables. This turned out, however, to be ana-
lytically intractable.
iii) Moreover, possible numerical methods are irrelevant since the considered
ASOV solution is meant for further inclusion in theoretical therapeutic optimiza-
tion algorithms.
iv) The reported in this paper consistency analysis of the ASOV solution to
this dynamical BVP is unique and new. Moreover, the only possible alternative
symmetry-basedanalysis(whichhassofarneverbeenattempted)wouldcertainly
be useful, if it happens to be tractable.
Conclusion
In this paper, we have studied the consistency question related to the ASOV so-
lution of the 3D dynamical BVP of NCT. The conclusive lemma 1 of this work
indicates that any symmetry-based analysis, which is probably too involved ana-
lytically, is of limited practical value. Distinctively, the reported related isovetor
analysis, of section 4 in the context of theorem 1, appears to be direct, concise
and elegant in establishing this consistency.
5 Appendix A : Exterior differential analysis
An exterior differential system (EDS) is a system of equations on a manifold
deﬁned by equating to zero a number of exterior differential forms, see e.g. [3].
When all the forms are linear, it is called a Pfaﬃan system. The theory of exterior
differential forms is coordinate (x;y;z;t) free and its related computations have a
distinctive algebraic character. A system of PDE’s of any number of independent
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 68Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2019
and dependent variables can be written as an EDS ( an isovector system). PDE’s
and their Pfaﬃan EDS’s are essentially the same, [3], in many respects.
The solutions of a BVP obtained by using Lie theory of continuous symmetry
groups are called group-invariant solutions. Furthermore, the relation between
Lie symmetries and prolongation structures, [1, 2], or EDS’s, of ﬁeld equations is
widely recognized.
In exterior differential calculus, the isovectors are elements of a vector space;
vectors may be added or multiplied by scalars. For the product, however, the
wedge (Grassmann) product^ is used. This is a generalization of the cross prod-
uct in 3D vector algebra. A product that introduces the notion of a multivector.
In actual fact the^ product is the "correct" type of product to use in comput-
ing a volume element dx in a tensor ﬁeld, see e.g. [6]. The inﬁnitesimal volume
element dx bounded by dx

. This is a technical reﬁnement, often omitted in vector ﬁelds, though
quite essential in tensor ﬁelds, encountered e.g. in the BVP (posed in this paper),
which incorporates a neutron diffusion tensor.
Exterior differential calculus (isovector calculus) is primarily intended, [30],
for calculation of invariance groups of EDS’s. Unfortunately, however, the max-
imum number of determining equations for the isovectors of a given PDE can
be very large. For typical 2D systems arising in ﬂuid dynamics there may be as
many as 1710 determining equations, [6, 30],This situation is expected to blow up
signiﬁcantly for the dynamical BVP posing in this work , in a way prohibiting its
performance by hand. Moreover, the alternative symbolic computation, see e.g.
[30], is not amongst our scheduled activities in the work.
For these reasons we have decided in this paper to abandon the classical
symmetry-related analysis for the consistency of the ASOV principle. Nonethe-
less, theexteriordifferentialcalculuscontinuestoprovideaproperabstractframe-
work for the treatment of geometrical vector (or tensor) operations that extend
naturally through thet-variable to general 4-dimensions in<: Its concise concepts
yield elegant and peculiarly coherent constructs (as with lemma1 and theorem 1)
in contrast with the intricacies of Lie symmetries of the original BVP or its EDS.
