Abstract: We obtain a sequence of eigenvaluesf 
j
g
1
j=1
for which there exist
countably many positive solutions of a fourth-order, singular boundary value
problem. These positive eigenfunctions correspond to the sequence of eigen-
values    1 (counting multiplicity). The methods involve application of the
 xed point arguments of the Krasnosel'skii cone expansion-compression type
and Holder's inequality.
Keywords: Singular boundary-value problem, Eigenvalue, Positive Solution,
Holder's inequality, Multiple solution.

Introduction

    (counting multiplicity) for which the
following singular boundary value problem which describes deformation of sim-
ply supported beam loaded uniformly in the transverse direction has countably
many positive solutions:

Singular boundary value problems describe many phenomena in applied sci-
ences,particularly a vast class of elastic deections. Equally numerous is the
nature of techniques applied in the analysis of such problems by investigators.
These techniques are dictated by the conditions imposed on the inhomogeneous
term in the equation as well as the boundary conditions. The ancillary condi-
tions in turn are prescribed by the mechanics of the problem. The literature
reveals several forms of the equation studied. Amongst these is the existence
and uniqueness result by Usmani (see [14] ) for the solution of the boundary
value problem of the type:
u

(t) =f(t)u(t) +g(t); t2 (0; 1) (1:3)

(1:4)
under the restriction supjf(t)j <  
4
. In his own case Afterbizadeh [1] proved
an existence result under the sharp condition that f is a bounded function.
The study has progressed to include the works of Del Pino and Manasevich
[4], Yang [16], Hao [5], Ma and Wang [10], Agrawal and O'Regan [2] and other
outstanding authors. Most of the contributions extended earlier works by im-
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal/ 43Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2009
posing stricter conditions on the inhomogeneous term in the equations. Various
methods employed include monotone [13], lower and upper solution techniques
(11, [12]), operator approximation and degree theory ([6], [15]) and  xed point
arguments of Leray-Schauder and Krasnosel'skii [8].
Recently there appears to be a fast growing interest in the investigation of
existence result of countably many positive solutions of boundary value prob-
lems (see [5], [9], [13] and references therein). Therefore our motivation for this
paper is in the direction of this trend. We obtain a sequence of eigenvalues
for countably many positive solutions of (1.1)-(1.2) using Krasnosel'skii's cone
type  xed point theorem and Holder's inequality. This work complements and
extends known results. The outline of the paper continues in Section 2 with a
presentation of preliminary notes involving the Green's function of (1.1)-(1.2).
We also state a  xed point theorem due to Krasnosel'skii [7] which will be used
to yield the multiple solutions of (1.1)-(1.2). We furnish an appropriate Banach
space framework of cones in order to apply the  xed point arguments. Addi-
tional assumptions onf and standard results using Holder's inequality are also
stated here. In the concluding Section, we state and prove the main result of
the paper as well as furnish an example of functions a(t) that satis es condi-
tions (

)  (

)
2. Preliminary notes
We begin this Section by de ning a positive solution of (1.1) as a function
u(t)2 C

[0; 1]\C

(0; 1) which satis es (1.l)-(1.2) and u(t)  0 for t2 (0; 1).
We assume additional conditions on a(t) and f as follows:
(
P

)9ff
i
(t)2C[(0; 1); [0;1)] (i = 1; 2) andh(u)2C[[0;1); [0;1)] such that

It is well known that the solutions of (1.1)-(1.2) are  xed points of the integral
operator:

It can than be seen that establishing the existence of positive solutions of (1.1)
- (1.2) is equivalent to proving the existence of  xed points of the operator
equation:
u(t) = Nu(t) (2:4)
We apply the following  xed point theorem to obtain positive solutions of (2.1)-
(2.2) for certain values of   :

Then N has a  xed point in K\ (

In the main result, we will require the notion of the Holder's inequality so
as to establish certain norm inequalities in our proof. The reader is referred to
the details of the theory in Deimling [3]. Some useful properties of the Green's
