Abstract
There are investigated the qualitative properties of the global attractors
of two classes of the ﬁnite dimensional dynamical systems connected to the
parabolic equation. For the semidynamical system generated by the discretiza-
tion of the parabolic equation there are obtained the suﬃcient conditions under
which the dynamical system appears, the size and the Hausdorff dimension of
the attractor are estimated. For the dynamical system generated by the re-
striction of Chafee-Infante system in the critical case on the inertial manifold
there is proved the polynomial estimate of the rate of attraction of the trajec-
tories to the attractor in the terms of the starting approximation. Also there is
obtained the estimate of the deviation of the attractor of the perturbed systemDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2003
from the attractor of the source system in the terms of the value of the system
perturbation.
Basic characteristics of the study
The actuality of the topic. The investigation of the global structure of
the inﬁnite dimensional dynamical and semidynamical systems is the rapidly
developing area of the modern mathematics [11], [19]. So called evolutionary
systems generated by the partially differential equations are especially impor-
tant and interesting for the investigation. The special attention is paied to the
structure of global attractors of such systems [1], [16], [9]. Except the structure
of the attractors the question concerning the dependence of the attractors from
the perturbations of the system has also received the intensive study [10], [11].
Along with the exploration of the inﬁnite dimensional evolutionary systems
there are studied two classes of the ﬁnite dimensional dynamical and semi-
dynamical systems generated either by the discretization of the appropriate
partial differential equation or by the restriction of the evolutionary equation
on its ﬁnite dimensional positive invariant manifold (so called inertial mani-
fold) [8], [18]. The most developed area of the inﬁnite dimensional evolutionary
systems theory is the theory of systems generated by the parabolic partial
differential equation [12].
The basic theory of the discretization of the parabolic equations started
to develop after the publication of the paper by Ladyzhenskaya O.A. [4]. The
paper was devoted to the global stability of the difference schemes for such
equations. For some of the schemes there was proved the existence of the
global attractors and their sizes and Hausdorff dimension were estimated. The
investigation of the dynamical system generated by full discretizations of the
parabolic equations was continued in the papers by different authors. Let’s
remark the paper by Eirola T. and Pilyugin S.Yu. [7]. In all mentioned inves-
tigations the time discretization used the simpliest method – Euler method.
One of the most important characteristics of the global attractor of the
dynamical system is the rate of attraction of the trajectories. In recent years a
lot of researchers [5] are interested in the exploration of the qualitative prop-
erties of the trajectories and the attractors of the systems of the differential
equations arising from the restriction of the evolutionary system corresponding
to so called Chafee-Infante problem [6]. One-dimensional Chafee-Infante prob-
lem studies a nonlinear semigroup generated by the Dirichlet boundary-value

where b> 0 is a parameter and the nonlinearity f belongs to the class of
functions which contains a function f(u) =u

as a typical representative. It
is known [12] that all the ﬁxed points of the generated semigroup S(t) are
hyperbolic while the system itself is structurally stable if and only if b6=m
2
,
m = 1,2,... That’s why the construction of the complete theory of Chafee-
Infante problem requires the investigation of the critical case b =m
2
. Such
research was started in the papers by Kostin I.N. [14], [13], where there are
exploredtheperturbationsoftheglobalattractorinthecriticalcase. Hence, by
theexampleofChafee-Infanteproblemtherewereobtainedtheﬁrstestimations
of the rate of attraction for the inﬁnite dimensional semigroup which is not
structurally stable. It was shown that under certain assumptions the rate of
attraction is polynomial.
The research of the inﬁnite dimensional systems like those considered by
Kostin I.N. was continued in the papers by Kornev A.A. [2], [3]. In all men-
tioned papers the polynomial rate of attraction to the global attractor of gener-
atedsystemwasprovedforthecaseofonenon-hyperbolicrestpoint. Alsothere
were obtained the results concerning the continuous parameter-dependence of
the attractor of the perturbed system. But the method of the papers didn’t
allow to obtain the suﬃcient information about the rate of attraction of the
individual points of phase space, because all the estimations obtained deal with
the neighbourhoods of the attractor of the system.
Another approach that appeared in the paper by Kostin I.N. and Pilyugin
S.Yu [15] allowed to prove the exponential estimation of the rate of attraction
in the terms of the starting approximation and to estimate the distance of the
global attractors of the perturbed and nonperturbed systems for gradient-like
systems generated by Chafee-Infante problem in non-critical case.
The aim of the study. To study the qualitative properties of the global
attractors for two classes of ﬁnite dimensional dynamical systems generated by
the discretization of parabolic equations and by the restriction of the appropri-
ate evolutionary systems on the inertial manifolds.
For the semidynamical system generated by the discretization of the para-
bolic equation to obtain the suﬃcient conditions under which the dynamical
system appears, to obtain the conditions of the dissipativity and to estimate
the size and Hausdorff dimension of the attractor.

For the dynamical system generated by the restriction of Chafee-Infante

estimation of the rate of attraction of the trajectories to the attractor in the
terms of the starting approximation, to obtain the estimation of the deviation

Basic method of the research. The research uses the methods of the
qualitativetheoryofthedynamicalsystemsanddifferentialequations, methods
of the functional analysis and linear algebra.
Scientiﬁc newness. All the basic results of the study are new.
1. For the ﬁrst time there are investigated the qualitative properties of the
dynamical and semidynamical systems generated by the discretization of
the Dirichlet problem for the parabolic equation by using Adams method
of the arbitrary degree.
(a) The suﬃcient conditions of the dynamical system construction are
obtained.
(b) The suﬃcient condition is given under which the system is dissipative
and the upper estimation of the diameter of the global attractor of
the system is obtained.
(c) The upper estimations of the Hausdorff dimension of the global at-
tractor of the system are obtained for both cases of small and large
Lipschitz constants of the nonlinearity. The obtained estimate of the
Hausdorff dimension does not depend on the parameters of the ap-
proximation method.
2. New results concerning the behaviour of the trajectories of gradient-like
system of the differential equations generated by the restriction of Chafee-
Infante system on its inertial manifold in the case of critical parameter
value are obtained.
(a) The global polynomial estimation of the rate of attraction of the tra-
jectories to the attractor in the terms of the starting approximation is
proved.
(b) The logarithmic approximation of the deviation of the attractor of the
perturbed system from the attractor of the source system in the terms
of the value of system perturbation is obtained.

Theoretical and practical value of the study. The results that were
obtained may be used in the construction of the dissipativity conditions, in the
construction of the estimations of the quantitive characteristics of the global
attractors of semidynamical systems generated by the discretizations of the
partial differential equations. The methods of the proofs used in the study may
be used in the construction of both local and global estimations of the rate of
attraction of the trajectories of the dynamical systems to the global attractor.

that satisfy the system of dif-
ference equations that will be described later. Boundary conditions (2) of the
source problem will naturally generate the boundary conditions of the discrete
problem:

where c

are the coeﬃcients of Adams method of degree p, the mapping f is
a natural spreading of the nonlinearity f into the R
N
space, and the square
matrix A arises from the approximation of the second derivative. The ﬁrst
member v
0
of the initial data for system (3) arises from the initial data of the
boundary-value problem for the parabolic equation, while other p−2 members
are probably obtained from another approximation method.
In §2 there is studied a problem of the solvability of the recurrent equa-
tion (3) regarding to v

inequality

the recurrent equation (3) is solvable regarding to v
n+1
and deﬁnes a Lipschitz
discrete semidynamical system.
Let’s denote by ϕ the semidynamical system arising from the described
discretization.
In §3 there are found the suﬃcient conditions under which the recurrent
equation (3) generates the dynamical system. These conditions appear funda-
mentally different for p = 2 and p≥ 3 cases.
Lemma 3.1. Let p = 2. If the condition (4) holds, the recurrent equa-
tion (3) deﬁnes a Lipschitz discrete dynamical system.
Lemma 3.2. Let p≥ 3. If the conditions (4) and

hold, then the recurrent equation (3) deﬁnes a Lipschitz discrete dynamical
system.
In§4 the dissipativity conditions for the semidynamical system ϕ are stud-
ied, and the upper estimate of the diameter of the global attractor of this
system is constructed.
Theorem 4.1. If the natural number N satisﬁes the condition

then there exists suchh

the semidynamical
system ϕ is dissipative in the sense of Levinson.
It is known [17] that any dissipative semidynamical system has a global
attractor. In§4 it is proved that the attractorA of the semidynamical system
ϕ is contained in the closed bounded set W
p−1
which is a Descartes power of
the closed ball

§5 is devoted to the construction of the estimation of Hausdorff dimension
of attractorA, the estimation that is uniform regarding all small enough steps
of the discretization. The following theorem is proved.
Theorem 5.1. The following statements hold.
1) If the Lipschitz constant of the nonlinearity f satisﬁes the condition
δ <π
2
,
then for any natural number N, satisfying the condition (5), there exists such
h
1
=h
1
(N)> 0, that for any 0<h<h
1
the semidynamical system ϕ possesses
the global attractor A with the Hausdorff dimension not exceeding 1.
2) If the inequality
δ≥π
2
holds then for any natural number N, satisfying the condition (5), there exists
such h
1
=h
1
(N)> 0, that for any 0<h<h
1
the semidynamical system ϕ
possesses the global attractorA with the Hausdorff dimension not exceeding the
minimum natural number k satisfying the inequality

(k+1)(2k+1)>δ+1.
Chapter 2 is devoted to the study of the dynamical system generated by
the restriction of the inﬁnite dimensional semigroup corresponding to Chafee-
Infante problem in the critical case on its inertial manifold. To do this there is
described and investigated the class of gradient-like systems of the differential
equations
˙ x =F(x), F ∈C

(R
n
),
and the dynamical systems generated by these equations, which satisfy seven
conditions (A)-(G), listed in§1 and§2 of chapter 2.
(A) There exists the open bounded domain G⊂R
n
in the closure of which
the dynamical system ϕ has a ﬁnite number of rest points.
(B) For each t> 0 the inclusion ϕ(t,G)⊂G holds.
(C)Systemϕ has a smoothLyapunov functionalV :G→R, whose deriva-
tive regarding the system ϕ

has the property
˙
V(x)< 0
for any x∈G that is not a rest point. For any rest point p the equality
˙
V(p) = 0 holds.
(D) All except one rest points of the dynamical system ϕ in G domain are
hyperbolic. For the nonhyperbolic rest point p
0
the matrix
∂F
∂x
(p
0
)
has one zero eigenvalue. Other eigenvalues have nonzero real parts. It is
known [19] that in this case the rest point p
0
has one dimensional central
manifold W
c
(p
0
). We assume that
ϕ(t,x)→p
0
as t→ +∞
for any x∈W
c
(p
0
).
(E) The value of Lyapunov functional for rest points satisﬁes the condition
V (p
0
)>V (p
i
), i = 1,...,m,
where p
0
is a nonhyperbolic point and (p
i
)
i=1,...,m
are all other rest points.
(F) Unstable manifold of the nonhyperbolic rest point, stable and unstable
manifolds of the hyperbolic rest points of the dynamical system ϕ are trans-
verse.
Let’s denote byA the global attractor of the dynamical system ϕ.
(G) For the nonhyperbolic rest point p
0
of system ϕ there exist such neigh-
bourhood U and numbers C > 0 and l > 0, that for any point x∈U for which
ϕ(t,x)∈U for 0<t<τ the following estimate
dist(ϕ(t,x),A)≤
 
Ct+dist
−l
(x,A)
 
−1/l
holds for 0<t<τ.
In §6 it is proved that all these conditions are satisﬁed for the restriction
of the inﬁnite dimensional evolutionary system generated by Chafee-Infante
problem in the critical case on its inertial manifold.
In §1 it is proved a set of statements concerning the basic qualitative
properties of the trajectories of the dynamical system ϕ, satisfying three con-
ditions (A)-(C).
Electronic Journal.  36Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2003
In §2 and later it is assumed that the system ϕ satisﬁes seven conditions
(A)-(G) described earlier. It is deﬁned the“arrow”relation for the pairs of the
rest points of the dynamical system ϕ (similarly to the one deﬁned for Kupka-
Smale systems) and several auxilary statements concerning the behaviour of
the trajectories of the system ϕ in the neighbourhood of the rest points are
proved.
In§3 the shift mapping for the ϕ system is deﬁned
S =ϕ(1,·).
This mapping generates the discrete dynamical system S. For this discrete
system in §3 the local exponential estimation of the rate of attraction in the
neighbourhood of the hyperbolic ﬁxed point is proved.
In §4 the main statement of chapter 2 is proved – the global polynomial
estimation of the rate of attraction of the trajectories of the system ϕ to the
attractor in the terms of the value of the initial approximation. Let’s denote
by B
r
(A) open r-neighbourhood of attractorA.
Theorem 4.1. There exist such numbers r > 0, K ≥ 1, C > 0 and l > 0
that for any point x∈B
r
(A) the estimate
dist(ϕ(t,x),A)≤K
 
Ct+dist
−l
(x,A)
 
−1/l
holds for t≥ 0.
Also in §4 is shown that the transversality condition ((F) condition) is
essential for the polynomial estimate of the rate of attraction to exist. An
example of the two-dimensional system not satisfying the transversality condi-
tion for which the polynomial estimate of the rate of attraction doesn’t hold is
described.
In §5 the attractors of the family of the perturbed systems S
τ
, τ ∈T are
studied and the estimate of the deviation of the attractor of the perturbed
system from the attractor of the source system S is obtained:
