Abstract. The issue of stabilization by an estimated state feedback for a fam-
ily of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems with nonlinear time delays is the focus of
this research. It is intended that the delay remain constant. The closed-loop
systems are found to be globally exponentially stable based on the Lyapunov-
Krasovskii functionals. Even with modeling uncertainty and state delay, it is
possible to design the controller and observer gains independently. Lastly, a
numerical example is provided to demonstrate how the primary finding can be
used.

1 Introduction
Anonlinearsystem’scontroldesignandstabilityanalysisarechallengingtasks.
In actuality, the control system’s controlled object is never linear. One of the
primary areas of study for the control community is the stability and stabiliza-
tion of systems, with or without delays. The theoretical definitions of asymp-
totic stability and stability in the sense of Lyapunov used in the majority of
contributions are too restrictive when taking into account real-world problems:
a system may be stable or asymptotically stable in theory, but in practice it is
unstable because the stable domain or the domain of the desired attractor is
too small; occasionally, a system’s state may be mathematically unstable, but
the system may oscillate close enough to this state for its performance to be
acceptable. The state estimation problem is a crucial one for control theory.
An observer’s goal is to recreate a system’s state using their understanding of
the both the system’s input and output. The Kalman filter or the Luenberger
observerarecommonlyusedtoestimatethesystemstateforlinearsystems. Ex-
tending the linear Kalman filter or the linear Luenberger observer to nonlinear
systemsisapopularmethodforestimatingthestateofnonlinearsystems. Nev-
ertheless, there aren’t many state estimate findings for nonlinear systems with
delayed states in the literature. These systems frequently show up when mod-
elingsystemsthatrequiredatapropagationandtransit, likebiologicalsystems,
chemicalreactors,andcommunicationsystems. Complexnonlinearsystemscan
occasionallybechallengingtocharacterizeusinglinearizationorrecognitionap-
proaches. Consequently, nonlinearobjectsareapproximatedusingtheso-called
fuzzy model, which expresses the local linear input-output relationship of non-
linearsystemsviafuzzyimplication. Sinceitenablesthesystematicapplication
of linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques and the parallel distributed com-
pensation idea to complicated nonlinear systems, Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy
model-based control has drawn a lot of attention recently. The output feed-
back control problem can also be resolved with T-S fuzzy model-based control.
The overall fuzzy model of the system is achieved by smoothly blending the
local linear models together through the membership functions. Then, based
on this fuzzy model, the control design is worked out by taking full advantage
of the strength of modern linear control theory. Such models can approximate
exactly a wide class of nonlinear systems. Hence it is important to study their
stability ([1]-[5]) or the synthesis of stabilizing controllers in the case of sys-
tems with delay ([7]-[17], [23], [27], [28]). Since time delays frequently appear
in many practical systems, such as chemical processes, and telecommunication

systems, the control problem for time-delay systems has received considerable
attention [14]. While there is an extensive literature on this topic most of the
reported studies focus on linear time-delay systems [3], due to the difficulty of
the stability analysis and controller design. The relative existing literature on
the technique can be roughly divided into three types: static output feedback
control [18], dynamic control [6], and observer-based control ([21],[26]). There-
fore, fuzzy observer-based control is the most popular scheme because the state
variables can be reconstructed by a T-S fuzzy observer. In our recent paper
([15]), under the fact that both the estimator dynamics and the state feedback
dynamics are stable we propose a separation principle for Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy
control systems with Lipschitz nonlinearities. The considered nonlinearities are
Lipschitz or meets an integrability condition which have no influence on the
LMI to prove the stability of the associated closed-loop system.
In this paper, we investigate the problem of global stabilization of a class of
nonlinear time-delay Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems with constant delay. We
use the parallel distributed compensation concept to propose state and output
feedback controllers. Consequently, we establish global exponential stability of
the closed-loop systems using suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. After
that, linear matrix inequality (LMI) issues are solved using the exponential
stability requirements that have been derived. Even with modeling uncertainty
and state delay, the controller and observer gains can be independently built
using the newly discovered LMI methods.
This is how the remainder of the paper is structured. A summary of some first
findings and a description of the system are provided in Section 2. Section
3 presents the main findings. To guarantee the nonlinear time-delay system’s
global exponential stability, linear state and output feedback controllers are
first created. Section 4 then provides a simulation result that illustrates the
efficacy of the suggested strategy.
2 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy delayed system
It is challenging to construct precise mathematical models of the majority of
physical systems due to their complexity and uncertainties. For small range
motion, these systems’ dynamics could exhibit either linear or nonlinear char-
acteristics. Lyapunov’slinearizationtechniqueisfrequentlyusedtocreatelocal
linearized approximations and addressthe local dynamics ofnonlinear systems.
In other words, a collection of local mathematical models can be used to par-

tition the complex system. Takagi and Sugeno have suggested a useful method
for combining these models by building with the fuzzy inferences.
2.1 Preliminaries
Consider the following time-delay system:
(
˙ x =G(x,x(t− τ ))
x(θ ) =ϕ (θ ),θ ∈ [− τ, 0]
(1)
where τ > 0 denotes the time delay and ϕ ∈ C is the initial function, where
C denotes the Banach space of continuous functions mapping the interval
[− τ, 0]−→ R
n
equipped with the supremum-norm:
∥ϕ ∥
∞
= max
θ ∈[− τ, 0]
∥ϕ (θ )∥
∥.∥ being the Euclidean-norm. The map G :R
n
−→ R
n
is smooth and satisfies
g(0,0) = 0. The function segment x
t
is defined by x
t
(θ ) =x(t+θ ), θ ∈ [− τ, 0].
Definition 1 [25] The zero solution of system (1) is said to be globally expo-
nentially stable with a decay σ > 0, if there exists a positive real β such that,
for any initial condition ϕ ∈C, the following inequality holds:
∥x(t)∥≤ β ∥ϕ ∥
∞
e
− σt
; for all t≥ 0.
Sufficient conditions for stability of time-delay systems are provided by the
theory of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals [14], a generalization of the classical
Lyapunov theory of ordinary differential equations [19]. The following theorem
gives sufficient conditions to ensure that the origin of system (1) is globally
exponentially stable [25].

then, the zero solution of (1) is globally exponentially stable with the decay rate

2.2 Fuzzy control system
The T-S fuzzy model is given by:
Rule i : If z

where x(t) ∈ R

is the state vector, u(t) ∈ R
m
is the control input vector,
A
i
(n,n) constant matrix, B
i
(n,m) matrix control input and the functions
˜
F
i
represent the delayed perturbations of each fuzzy subsystem for i = 1,...,r. F
ij
is the fuzzy set (j = 1,2,...,p), z(t) =
T
(z
1
(t),...,z
p
(t)) is the premise variable
vector associated with the system states and inputs and r is the number of
fuzzy rules. Center of gravity defuzzification yields the output of fuzzy system:
˙ x =

where

(z

and F

(z

) denotes the grade of the number ship function F

, corresponding
to z

(t). Let µ i
(z) be defined as:
ζ i
(z) =
w
i
(z)
P
r
i=1
w
i
(z)
.
Then, the fuzzy system has the state-space form:
˙ x =
r
X
i=1
ζ i
(z)(A

i
u(t)+
˜
F

(x,x(t− τ ),u))
Clearly,
r
X
i=1
ζ i
(z) = 1
and
ζ i
(z)≥ 0 for i = 1,...,r.
It is assumed that the T-S fuzzy system is as follows:
The pairs (A
i
,B
i
), i = 1,...,r are controllable. That is, the nominal fuzzy
system is locally controllable.
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2025.306 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 80Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2025
Based on this assumption, a state feedback control gain K
i
can be obtained by
pole placement design or Ackerman’s formula, such that each local dynamics
is stably controlled. The representation of the global control input matrix,
denoted by B, is in the form: B =
P
r
i=1
ζ i
B
i
. This means that the global
control input matrix dominates the control performance. The design of the
fuzzy controller can be taken as a linear state feedback control can defined as:
Rule i : If z
1
(t) is F
i1
and z
2
(t) is F
i2
... and z
p
(t) is F
ip
, then
u(t) =− K
i
x(t), i = 1,2,...,r,
where K

is the local state feedback gain. Consequently, the defuzzified result
is:

In this case, an observer can be designed which has the form:

We wish to find a gain matrix L such that the error e(t) = ˆ x(t)− x(t) converge
exponentially to zero as t goes to infinity. We assume that the following rules
are given concerning the observer of each subsystem.
Rule l : If z

the building of the closed-loop fuzzy system does not guarantee its stability.
The following assumptions on the matrices (A
i
;B
i
;C
i
), can now be used to
summarize this fact in order to demonstrate a stabilization result using an
observer. First, (A
i

) are controllable and second (C

) are observable for
i = 1,2,...,r. The state-feedback gain K
i
and the state-observer gain L

can be
obtained by formulating a synthesis tool based on some LMIs.

To guarantee global exponential stability of the nonlinear time-delay system

, we shall provide time-delay independent conditions
in this work. We shall suggest a state controller and an output feedback con-
troller using parallel distributed compensation. Thus, we will create conditions
for linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). It is important to note that when the
nonlinearities satisfy a linear growth condition or are Lipschitz, several results
onthestabilizationofthenonlinearsystem(5)proposinglinearmatrixinequal-

3 Main results
We first establish a stabilization result and then take into consideration a fuzzy
observer based on a fuzzy controller in order to stabilize the fuzzy system via
a state estimated feedback law. It is commonly known that a stabilizing es-
timated feedback controller for linear systems is produced when an observer
and a stabilizing state feedback are combined. The separation principle is the
name given to this. However, it is unknown if the separation principle holds
true because the fuzzy system under consideration is nonlinear. Additionally,
keep in mind that a TS model with uncertainties does not make this separation
concept any more accessible.

Since,

then c> 0 and d> 0. Consequently,

Thus, condition (3) of theorem (2.1) is satisfied. Therefore, the system (7)− (6)
is globally exponentially stable.

therefore, the constant ϱ should satisfies

where α =

then, α> 0. Thus, 1− 2∥P∥γ 2

Since sensing devices cannot access the state variables and transducers are
either unavailable or prohibitively expensive, the physical state variables of
systemsareeithercompletelyorpartiallyunavailableformeasurementinmany
real-world control situations. Control schemes based on observers should be
developed in these situations in order to estimate the state. Newt, for the
perturbed fuzzy system, an observer-based controller is suggested to stabilize
the closed-loop dynamic. by fusing the state fuzzy feedback control rule with a
Luenberger-like state fuzzy observer.
3.2 Observer based controller
ItisdemonstratedthatT-SmodelswithaPDCcontrollawexhibitexponential
stabilization. This control law’s primary characteristic is that it is based on
the same assumptions as the T-S model. Conditions of stabilization with a
fuzzy observer exist if the state cannot be measured, but they assume that the
premises can be measured. The system that we suggest is as follows:
˙
ˆ x =
r
X
i=1
ζ i
(z)
 
A

ˆ x+B

u− L

Where ˆ y given by ˆ y =

ˆ x and the estimated feedback controller is
given by
u =− r
X
i=1
ζ i

ˆ x. (14)
We wish to find L
i
, i = 1,...,r such that e = x− ˆ x converges to zero exponen-
tially as t tends to infinity.
Subtracting (7) from (13), we have the system error

ofnonlineartime-delayfuzzysystemsinthispaper. Toguaranteetheglobalex-

the controller can be created independently using the conventional LMIs con-
