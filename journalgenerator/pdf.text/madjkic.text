Abstract
In this paper we presented the partial differential equations [4] for the wave-pockets in
the Minkowski 4-dimensional spaces. In particular we considered the stationary cases for
the matter wave-pockets, by considering that in all cases, the geometric form (the matter
distribution  ) of a particle in a given time-instancet depends on the particular boundary
conditions for these differential equations as well.
In physics and mathematics, Minkowski space (or Minkowski time-space) is the
mathematical setting in which Einstein's theory of special relativity is most
conveniently formulated. In this setting the three ordinary dimensions of space
are combined with a single dimension of time to form a four-dimensional man-
ifold for representing a time-space.
In theoretical physics, Minkowski space is often contrasted with Euclidean
space. While a Euclidean space has only spacelike dimensions, a Minkowski
space also has one timelike dimension. We de ne the basic time-space four
mutually orthogonal vectors e

Note that the matrix above is a particular case of the Minkowski tensor using
a four-dimensional time-space, which combines the real dimension of time with
the three imaginary dimensions of space.

The plan of this paper is the following: In Section 1 we present an introduction
to matter-events in the Minkowski's space, and we speci ed their stationary
conditions for the massive and massless elementary particles. In Section 2
we speci ed the formal de nition for matter-events as propagation of wave-
pockets, and we presented an example for the propagation of photons (light).
The main result is developed and presented in Section 3, in two propositions
with proofs, for the  rst and for the second-order partial differential equations of
these wave-pockets. Finally, in Section 4 are given applications of these results
to the quantum mechanics, with two signi cant examples.
1 Introduction to matter-events
In any given instance of timet, any matter-event in this time-space is a partic-
ular time-space perturbation 	(
  !
r

), that can be mathematically given by the
following Fourier transformation:
	(

It is a space-distribution of a particle in a given instance of time t, and it
changes in time, that is, the amplitudes A(k) are generally dependent on time

as well.
Mathematically, these matter-events are complex functions, composed by one
real and one imaginary component. The amplitudes A(k) of the harmonics, in
a given instance of time t, are given by inverse Fourier transformation,
A(k) =

The elementary particles are pocket waves that propagate in this four-
dimensional space.
Thus, for such particular stationary cases we have that d!(k)=d

k is con-
stant (that is, it does not depend on
  !
k ), equal to the particle's velocity

(negative sign is the consequence that e

that can depend on the time t as well.
Consequently, for any  xed instance of time t, by integration we obtain that,

The phase velocity of a particle's pocket-wave, observed in a given referential
system, is de ned by # =
!
0
k
0
.
The constant !
0
is determined as follows in the following two cases, by consid-
ering that the angular frequency !(k) for its particular values is correlated by
De Broglie [1] to the total energy o particle E = ~!(k):
  Case for massive particles (with rest massm
0
> 0), denominated as mass-
particles as well: when
  !
v = 0 then the energy of this particle isE =m

,
that is, the energy in the rest-state of this particle. Consequently, from (0)
we have that !
0
=!(k) =

.
Consequently, for the total energy of these mass-particles that propagates
with velocity v =j
  !

, it holds that,
E =

is a computed angular frequency relative to the
velocity v of this particle w.r.t. the reference system of an observer (for
different observes in different referential systems, that move with different

velocities, this computed value of the same observed particle is different).
For an observer in a given  xed position (the origin of its coordinate system,
for example), this observed particle's frequency is by Lorentz low slowed
down by the factor
p
1  
2
, so that the really observed particle's angular
frequency of the observed wave-pocket 	(
  !
r
4
) given above is constant and
equal to!
v
p
1  
2
=!
0
. Thus,!
0
is the angular frequency of this massive
particle equal in any inertial system (without acceleration), that is, an
invariant as is the rest-mass m
0
.
  Case for massless particles (with rest mass m
0
= 0): they propagate, as
usual, with very high velocity c  v > 0 equal to the maximal velocity
of light if this particle propagates in the vacuum, thus the zero value of
equation (0) we can obtain when
  !
k =
  !
k
0
=
  !
p
~
. Consequently, the value
of E is the total energy of this particle with the given momentum
  !
p , so
that !
0
= !(k) = !(
p
~
) =
E
~
. The total energy of massless particles is
de ned by E = ~!
o
= (~k
0
)# = p#. When a particle propagates in the
vacuum then # =c, so that E =pc.
When the total energy changes in time, to a  xed observer this angular
frequency appears to change as well (for example, the relativistic effects
for red-shifting of photons for a  xed observer). Thus, differently from
massive particles where for a  xed observer
@!

can change in
time, if a particle changes its total energy during the propagation.
2 De nition of the wave-pocket in the Minkowski pseu-
doeuclidean space
Consequently, from the introduction to matter-events given in the previous Sec-
tion, for the wave-pocket of an elementary particle, and given reference system,
we have that

In what follows we introduce the spatial vector
  !
u =

r 
  !
vt, that is equal to
zero for the time-space points of particle's trajectory.
The "corpuscular" geometric wave-pocket shape (matter's distribution) of a
particle, that appears to a  xed observer, is given by

In the case when a particle propagates in the vacuum with a constant velocity
  !
v (stationary case), then the coe cients B(k) does not change in time, i.e.
@B(k)
@t
= 0, so that the "corpuscular" geometry (matter distribution) does not
change in time and  (
  !
r;t) =  (
  !
u ) =  (
  !
r 
  !
vt) =  (x v
x
t;y v
y
t;z v
z
t)
is a wave-pocket that propagates with a velocity
  !
v .
For instance, in such a stationary case, for a particle with m
0
= 0 (for example
boson as photon, graviton, etc..) that propagates in the vacuum with a veloc-
ity equal to its phase velocity (when c =j
  !
cj =#), so that the total energy is
E =p# =pc = 
  !
p
  !
c , we have that !
0
= 
  !
p
  !
c=~, so that
	(x;y;z;t) =  (
  !
r 
  !
ct)e
 i
  !
p (
  !
r 
  !
ct)=~
= 	(
  !
r 
  !
ct).
But in non-stationary cases, when a particle changes its velocity and total
energy, its distribution ("corpuscular" geometry)   changes in time as well,
because the coe cientsB(k) in the Fourier integral above change in time, that
is,
@B(k)
@t
6= 0. In such more complex cases with an acceleration of particles,
we have both phenomena: particle changes its velocity, momentum and total
energy (because of the interaction with another particles), and its corpuscular
geometry as well.
There are particular cases, when a particle does not change its total energy and
with
@
@t
(
  !
p
  !
v ) = 0, with acceleration caused only by (constant) velocity that
changes its direction, when   does not change in time its distribution w.r.t. its
trajectory, so that it is of the form  (
  !
r 
  !
vt). For instance in the case of the
stationary rotation of electrons around nucleus of an atom.
Thus, based on standard Fourier transformation, the function  (
  !
r;t) is a real
function, differently from 	(x;y;z;t that is complex. The real and imaginary
components of 	(x;y;z;t) are determined by the oscillation of the complex os-
cillator component e
i( 
  !
p
  !
r
~
 !
0
t)
, that is an oscillation identical to the complex
plain wave (like, for example, the complex electromagnetic plain wave). The
amplitudesB(k) of the harmonics can be obtained by the inverse Fourier trans-
formation, for each given instance of time t, by:
B(k) =

Thus, generally any particle is determined by the pocket-wave 	(x;y;z;t)
composed by two sub components: by the corpuscular matter distribution

is a complex function.
Example 1: speed of light.
When light propagates through a material, it travels slower than the vacuum
speed. This is a change in the phase velocity # of the light and is manifested
in physical effects such as refraction. The ratio between c and the speed # at
which light travels in a material is called the refractive index n of the material
(n = c=#). Refraction occurs when light waves travel from a medium with a
given refractive index to a medium with another at an angle. At the bound-
ary between the media, the wave's phase velocity is altered, usually causing
a change in direction. Its wavelength increases or decreases but its frequency
remains constant (thus photons change their momentum and velocity but does
not change their energy). This reduction in speed is quanti ed by the refractive
index of the material.
For example, for visible light the refractive index of glass is typically around
1:5, meaning that light in glass travels at c=1:5  200; 000km=s; the refractive
index of air for visible light is about 1:0003, so the speed of light in air is very
close to c.
Certain materials have an exceptionally low group velocity for light waves, a
phenomenon called slow light. In 1999, a team of scientists led by Lene Hau
were able to slow the speed of a light pulse to about 17 meters per second (61
km/h; 38 mph) [3], they were able to momentarily stop a beam [2].
 
It can be shown that, in the case of these massless elementary particles that
propagate in vacuum with the velocity of light c, we have that this "corpuscu-
lar" wave pocket in the stable(general) state corresponds to the Dirac function
(with A(k) = B(k) = 1=(2 )
3
),  (
  !
r  
  !

x
t;y c
y
t;z c
z
t) =
 (x c
x
t) (y c
y
t) (z c
z
t). It is reasonable assumption that the volume of
a distribution   (where it is greater than zero) of a massive particle (with rest
mass m
0
greater than zero) is always greater than zero, so that it is a reason
that such particles can not reach the limit velocity of light. In the analog way,
the massless particles (with rest mass equal to zero) must have, in their stable
state, this volume equal to zero, so that their distribution   is equal to Dirac
function above, and they are able to propagate with the velocity of light in the
vacuum. The non stable states of particles with rest mass m
0
= 0 can have
more complex wave-pocket forms and it happen only in a very short instances
of time, when the particle enters in strongly unsymmetric space region, as will
be explained in what follows. In such situations its velocity of propagation
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 54Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2011
becomes less than the velocity of light in the vacuum so that this particle can
have a similar behavior as massive particles with   that occupies a limited but
nonzero volume (so called spatial explosion of excited bosons). This unstable
state of the particles withm
0
= 0 tends to come back into the stable state with
Dirac function geometry for distribution  .
For any matter-perturbation of an elementary particle that propagates in the 3-
dimensional space with a velocity that changes in the time, because of external
forces that inuence this particle, the 3-dimensional wave-pocket distribution
 (x;y;z;t) changes as well, but it must satisfy the conservation matter prin-
ciple, that is, at each given time instance t it must be satis ed the following
invariance property:

=
RRR
+1
 1
 (x;y;z;t)dxdydz =
RRR
+1
 1
 (x;y;z; 0)dxdydz > 0,
where 1
 
is a time-invariant constant value of an elementary particle (not neces-
sarily equal to 1), andV (t) is a  nite cube (or sphere) which contains the whole
"corpuscular" wave-pocket in a given instance of time t, and dV =dxdydz.
We de ne the minimal (limit) cubeV
m
(t) =lim(2

4X4Y4Z), such that in
this time-instancet,  (x;y;z;t) = 0 for (x  4X orx 4X ory  4Y
or y 4Y or z  4Z or z 4Z).
The real function  (x;y;z;t) is the "corpuscular" geometric wave-pocket form
of a particle that propagates in the ordinary 3-dimensional space with a veloc-
ity

The interactions between any two pocket-waves (particles) can be obtained only
by their local collisions, and depending on their energy and velocities they can
produce a kind of Compton effects (elastic collisions) where they survive the
collisions by chaining their momentum and energy (with conservation of total
momentum and energy), or can make total fusion between them with possible
creation of new stable particles (in Feynman's diagrams). In order to be able
for two pocket-waves to have a collision, and mutual interference, at least one
of them must have a volume V
m
(t) (in a given instance of time of mutual col-
lision) greater than zero. So, from this point of view, it can not happen that
the distance between any two particles becomes equal to zero, so that we avoid
classic in nitary problems of gravitational and electronic  elds and forces where
the particles are pointlike, so that it is possible to have the distances between
particles equal to zero with, consequently, in nite values of gravitational (or
electric) forces.
The particles with V
m
(t) equal to zero are, for example, the particles with

 (x v

t).
Thus, for any two particles with the "corpuscular" form given by Dirac function,
it is impossible to have the collisions in their stable states, but only when they
are excited and are involved in their temporary "spatial explosions". Such ex-
plosions can happen also when two stable particles are very close one to another
so that the ideal spatial symmetry for a free particle in the vacuum does not hold
more: it explains why, for example, photons can interact with gravitons (i.e.,
gravitational  eld) and may have the gravitational redshifts. Because of that,
it will be natural consequence that the massless particles, as bosons (gravitons,
photons, etc..) in their stable states, will have the volume V
m
(t) equal to zero
(with Dirac function for their distribution  ). In that case they can be used as
intermediators between the massive particles (that have the rest mass and the
volumeV
m
(t) greater than zero), that is, to be the quantum-correspondence for
the " elds" (the statistical events as gravitational, electromagnetic, etc., that
are statistical results of actions of a high number of bosons), by avoiding in
more common situations the signi cant interference between themselves.
This situation can be obtained in the quantum level only if the collisions between
gravitons and photons, for example, are practically improbable. Consequently,
a number of gravitons and photons can coexist in the same small region of space
without any signi cant direct interference between them during the contempo-
rary collisions with particles with rest mass and volume V
m
(t) greater than
zero. Also in such situation we can have the cases of the interference between
a graviton and a photon, in the situation when they are very, very close in a
given instance of time, so that they are involved in temporary spatial explosion
(with their volume of distribution greater than zero in that instance of time).
In normal situations, these interferences statistically can be neglected, while in
the cases of very strong  eld interactions (when the local density of photons
and gravitons is very high) these inter-boson's interactions are signi cant, so
that the gravitation  eld has strong interactions with the electromagnetic  eld
in a given local space region.

Notice that

@t
6= 0 only for the massless particles in their unstable states and
very-very short interval of times4t  0, when they change their total energy
E = ~!
0
during the collisions with another particles (the Compton effects). In
what follows we will denote byE = ~!
p
the energy associated to this angular
frequency !
p
.
Example 2: The stationary case is obtained when a particle propagates with
constant total energyE and constant valueE = ~!
p
. Thus, in such a stationary
case we have that  
D
(
  !
r;t) = 0; 	
D
(
  !
r;t) = 0. It is easy to verify that the
stationary case is one, for example, of the following two cases:
1. When a particle propagates with constant momentum
  !
p , velocity
  !
v (thus,
@
  !
v
@t
=
@
  !
p
@t
= 0), and total energyE (in that case!
0
is constant for massless
particles as well). Thus, without any acceleration. In that case !
p
is
constant as well, with constantE = ~(

constant angular velocity   =

, constant value of the momentum
p =j
  !
vj, and total energy E. In this case we can obtain !
p
constant in
a particular coordinate system: coordinate center of the reference system
x;y of the plain in which this particles routes. Then, the position of the
trajectory of this particle in a given momentt is equal to
  !
r =R
  !
i
 
, where
  !
i
 
is a unitary radial vector with angle   =  t w.r.t the axis x. In this
case the acceleration

, and
@
  !
p

@
  !
p
@t
j
  !
i
 
are radial vectors
that have the constant values and are orthogonal to the vectors of velocity
  !
v and momentum
  !
p . So that,
  !
p
  !
r = 0,
  !
p

= 0, and

Here both !

with constantE = ~!

the stationary orbits of electrons in an atom, in Example 4.

and express the particle's phase-changing on its trajectory.  
Notice that the energy changes only during collisions with another particles
(Compton effects; we consider a " eld" as a statistical result of the iterations
with bosons of this particular  eld), so that after it this particle continue to
propagate again as a stationary particle, but with new values of total energyE,
velocity
  !
v , momentum
  !
p , and new stable wave-pocket geometry (distribution)
 (
  !
r 
  !
vt), so that it can be described by the simpler stationary-case (de ned
in Example 2) differential equations:

where, when a velocity
  !
v is constant, we have that
@(
  !
vt)
@t
=
  !
v +t
@
  !
v
@t
=
  !
v .
Notice that, as in Example 2 above, we have particular stationary cases when
  !
v is not constant, as for instance, for a stationary electron that rotates around
the nucleus of an atom with a constant radial acceleration (in that case
  !
p
  !
v
and total energy of this electron are constant, thus E =E +
  !
p
  !
v is constant
as well).
From the quantum state point of view, the external " eld's" forces that inter-
fere with the particles are based on the collisions between them and a particular
kind of " eld's" particles with rest mass equal to zero (bosons): it is possible
because the mass-particles (or excited massless particles) have a wave-pocket's
distribution   with a  nite space volume, and, consequently, they may mutu-
ally collide with another particles (as bosons of this " eld").
The bosons with rest-mass m
0
equal to zero can interfere between themselves
only when they are excited, i.e., when their space volume distribution of   is
greater than zero, so that they can collide. During these collisions, a particle
changes its total energy as well, thus its geometric form (distribution)   as well:
in such cases in the equations (e.1) and (e.2), the component,

becomes dominant in these unstationary (unstable) short-time intervals states,
caused by the time-changing of the harmonic amplitudes
@B(k)

6= 0. During
these collisions a particle does not change only its velocity
  !
v , but also its ge-
ometry (distribution) can continuously evolve. For example, as it was discussed
about the changing of massive particle's geometry and resulting changing of the
relativistic mass, or in "particle's explosions". This kind of explosion happens
when, for instance, a massless particle that propagates in the vacuum with ve-
locity of light come up against a barrier with a small slit (where it will pass),
so that this barrier interrupts drastically the space symmetry and the bound-

ary conditions for the differential equations (e.1) and (e.2) that determine the
movement and geometry of the particles.
From this point of view, the " elds" are only statistical results of the inuence
that high number of bosons produce to the mass-particles. For example, the
electromagnetic vectorial  eld is a statistic result of movements of high number
of photons, as it will be explained in the rest of this paper, and, consequently,
Maxwell's lows are only the statistical lows.
The collisions of one mass-particle with bosons produce an external force
  !
F ,
generated by the interacting bosons (" eld") with this particle, that determines
the propagation and trajectory of this mass-particle. In order to be able to con-
sider the application of these external forces to the mass-particles, we need to
obtain the following second-order differential equations:

The differential equation (e.3) describes the changing (in time) of the geometry
  of a the "corpuscular" particle (wave-pocket) and its trajectory and velocity,
caused by a given external force
  !
F (that is, caused by a total sum of given
external " elds", as gravitational, electromagnetic, etc..).
4 Application to quantum mechanics
The Compton effect between any two particles with their distributions
 
1
(x;y;z;t) and  
2
(x;y;z;t), happens when there exists a space-time point
(x
1
;y
1
;z
1
;t
1
) such that  
1
(x
1
;y
1
;z
1
;t
1
)   
2
(x
1
;y
1
;z
1
;t
1
)6= 0. This collision of
these two particles is elastic if their kinetic energies are relatively small, with
the well known lows of conservation of the total energy and total momentum
for elastic collisions. In the high-energy collisions we obtain a fusion of these
two particles and a creation of another, as in well-known Feynman diagrams.
In the stationary cases, the basic equation (e.4) can be divided into following
three cases:
  When the velocity v = 0, we obtain a simple equation:
(e.4.0)
@
2
	
1
@t
2
= 0, that is,
@
2
	
@t
2
= !
2
0
	,
with a simple solution, 	(x;y;z;t) =  (x;y;z)e
 !
0
t
.
  When the velocity
  !
v and the momentum
  !
p are constant vectors dur-
ing the propagation, different from zero, then
  !
v
1
=
  !
v , so we obtain
D'Alambert equation where v is a constant value:

v = v(  cos e

), where   =  t =
v
R
t is the angle w.r.t the
axisx of a particle that routes around the coordinate center with constant
angular velocity   =
v

on circular orbit with constant radius R).
Thus, from (e.4) we obtain an extended D'Alambert equation where v

Notice that the massive particles that does not change the total energy E dur-
ing a propagation are always in the stationary states.
In all cases, the geometric form (the distribution  ) of a particle in a given
time-instance t depends on the particular boundary conditions for the differ-
ential equations as well. In the case when they are far from another massive
particles (usually it can be considered if another particles are far from this par-
ticle in order of one millimeter), then   is symmetric w.r.t. the direction of
propagation. Otherwise, the boundary conditions for these differential equa-
tions can drastically change, with the result that   can become enormously
bigger than in normal situations, that is, they can instantaneously "explode",
because the single harmonics of the Fourier representation of  (x;y;z) in a
given time-instance t are contemporarily present in the whole 3-dimensional
Euclidean space.
Let us consider the following well known example:
Example 3: One-dimensional particle in a box problem.
We assume that that the electron can move freely between two in nitely high
potential barriers, along the x axes between 
a
2
and
a
2
. The appropriate po-
tential is V (x) = 0 for 
a
2
  x 
a
2
and V (x) equal to the in nity otherwise,
that is, there are in nitely high walls at x = 
a
2
and x =
a
2
, and the particle
is trapped between them. This turns out to be quite a good approximation for
electrons in a long molecule, and the three-dimensional version is a reasonable
picture for electrons in metals. Consequently, the  eld, which is the gradient of
this potential is equal to zero between these walls and directed into the box at
the barriers, so that in the box we have not any  eld and any acceleration of
the electron, so that the equation (e.4) has a simple D'Alambert form

with the solution (we consider case when the momentum and the velociries are
collinear withx axes)

(x;y;z;t) =  (x vt;y;z)e
i(
p
~
(x vt)
, where  (x vt;y;z)
is the geometric form of electron during its propagation (notice that this elec-
tron is at position x in the time-instance t when x vt = 0), and the constant
velocity v can be positive and negative (opposite direction w.r.t. the x axes).
The boundary condition at the walls is that in these points the velocity of the
electron has to be equal to zero, and the stationary solution of the D'Alambert
equation above has to satisfy that (after one complete oscillation, when it passes
the distance 2a), 	
1
(x;y;z;t) =

(x v(t +

), for n = 0; 1; 2;::
so that we obtain that p =
 ~
a
n, where n = 0; 1; 2;::, exactly as in the
solution of the Schr odinger equation. The positive and negative values for p
corresponds to the propagation on the left or on the right (opposite direction)
of this electron. Consequently we obtain a constant discrete set of possible
velocities v =
p
m
0
(we consider only non relativistic case when v<<c).
The (non relativistic) kinetic energy of this electron can be one of the following
discrete values:

The D'Alambrt-like equation (e.4) is very important for the particles with the
rest mass greater than zero as well, and especially to their stationary cases as
well, when !
p
6= 0, as for example in the stationary orbits of electrons in the
atoms. Based on the stationary solutions of the D'Alambert-like differential
equation for electrons, directly from (e.4) we can derive the 3rd Bohr postulate,
as follows:
Example 4: 3rd Bohr postulate for the electrons.
The electrons in the atoms have constant velocity v > 0 and momentum p, so
that the non relativistic equation for electron's wave-pocket 	 and its propa-

we obtain the stationary case for the electron's propagation:
