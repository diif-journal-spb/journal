Abstract
In this work a class of third order delay differential equations (where the non-
linear functions, especially the ﬁrst two restoring terms, are sum of multiple
deviating arguments and the forcing term simultaneously depend explicitly on
the independent variable t for all i, the last restoring term has variable coeﬃ-
cient and deviating arguments τ
i
(t) vary for all i) is considered.
By employing the direct technique of Lyapunov, where a complete Lya-
punov functional is constructed and used, we obtain suﬃcient conditions that
guarantee the existence of solutions which are periodic, uniformly asymptot-
ically stable, uniformly ultimately bounded. The behaviour of solutions as t
tends to inﬁnity is studied. The obtained results are new and include manyDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N. 1, 2019
recent results in the literature. Finally, two examples are given to show the
feasibility of our results.

1 Introduction
Functional or delay differential equation is one of the major branches of differ-
ential equations because it generalizes most of the classical equations such as
ordinary differential equations, difference differential equations, integral equa-
tions and integro-differential equations. Accordingly, much attention has been
devoted to the study of delay differential equations. See for instance Bur-
ton [16, 17], Driver [18], Hale [20], Lakshmikantham et al. [21], Yoshizawa
[41, 42, 43] which contain basic background to the study. In a wide variety of
problems involving non linear delay differential equations of higher order, it is
essential to establish conditions on the solutions that are periodic, stable and
bounded. Third order nonlinear differential equations with and without delay
have attractedand still attractingthe attentionof many researchers because of
their importance in real world situations. We can mention for instance the pa-
persofAdemolaet al. [1]-[13],Adesina[14],AfuwapeandOmeike[15],Olutimo
and Adams [22], Graef and Tun¸ c [19],Omeike [23, 24], Remili et al. [25, 26],
Tun¸ c [28]-[36], Tun¸ c and Erg¨ oren [37], Tun¸ c and G¨ ozen [38], Tun¸ c and Mo-
hammed [39], Yao and Wang [40], Zhu [44]. In this regard, these cited papers
and their references contain outstandingresults on the qualitativebehaviour of
solutions of considered differential equations.
In an interesting contribution, Tun¸ c [33] discussed the asymptotic stability
and boundedness of solutions to a kind of nonlinear third order differential
equations with retarded arguments:

and obtained conditions that guarantee the existence of solutions that are uni-
formly bounded.
Another contribution worthy of mentioning is the work of Remili and Oud-
jedi [25] which dwells on the stability and boundedness of the solutions of non
autonomous third order delay differential equation of form

where τ is a constant. Recently, Ademola et al. [12] established criteria for
stability, boundedness and existence of periodic solutions to third order delay
differential equations with multiple deviating arguments:

[38]. The obtained results are new and include many existing results in the
literature. Despitetheattentionthathasbeengiventothethirdordernonlinear

Deﬁnition2.1. (See[20]). SupposethatF(t,0)= 0forallt∈ R.Thesolution

Deﬁnition 2.2. (See [20]). The solution X

Deﬁnition 2.5. (See [21]). The solutions of (2.1) are ultimately bounded for
bound M, if there exist an M > 0 and a T = T(t

Deﬁnition 2.6. (See [21]). The solutions of (2.1) are uniformly ultimately
bounded for bound M, if the T in Deﬁnition 2.5 is independent of t
0
.
Deﬁnition 2.7. (See [17]). A continuous functionW :R

withW(0)=
0, W(s)> 0 if s6= 0, and W strictly increasing is a wedge. (We denote wedges
by W or W

, where i is an integer).
Lemma 2.1. (See [42]). Suppose that F(t,φ) ∈ C

conditions, there exists a periodic solution of (2.1) of period ω. In particular,
the relation (2.2) can always be satisﬁed if h is suﬃciently small.

Then the solution (x

ultimately bounded.
Remark 3.2. We observed the following:

(i) If f
i
(·) = a¨ x, g
i
(·) = b˙ x, φ(t)h
i
(x(t−τ
i
(t))) = cx and p
i
(·) = 0, then the
equation (1.1) reduces to a linear constant coeﬃcients third order differen-
tial equation
x

and hypotheses (i) to (vi) of Theorem 3.1 reduce to Routh Hurwitz criteria
a > 0,b > 0,ab > c and c > 0 for asymptotic stability for third order
differential equation.
(ii) When i = 1, we have f
1
(·) = h(·), g
1
(·) = g(·) and φ(t)h
1
(x(t−τ
1
(t))) =
f(x(t−τ(t))) where h(·), g(·) and h(·) are independent of t, then the equa-
tion (1.1) becomes the case discussed in [31].
(iii) Whenever i = 1, we have f
1
(·) = ϕ(x,x

)x

, g
1
(·) = g(x

(t − τ(t))),

i
(·) = p(t,x,x

) with
0≤τ

(iv) If i = 1, we have f

(v) whenever i = 1, so that τ

(·) = a(t)h(x(t),x

g

(·) = g(x

(t − τ(t))), φ(t)h
1
(x(t − τ

p
i
(·) = p(t,x,x((t− τ)),x

,x

((t− τ)),x

) then the equation (1.1) is a
special case of the recent work discussed in [22].
(vi) When the nonlinear functions g and h are independent of the independent
variable t, then the equation (1.1) is a case discussed in [12].
Hence, Theorem 3.1 includes and extends the results in [2]-[15], [22]-[40] and
the references cited therein.
Next, we will state and prove a result that would be useful in the proof of
Theorem 3.1 and the succeeding ones.

Proof. Let (x

t

t
= 0
in equation (3.1), we ﬁnd that
V(t,0,0,0)= 0
for all t ≥ 0. Also, from hypothesis (iv) of Theorem 3.1, h
i
(0) = 0, it follows
that the functional V deﬁned in the equation (3.1) can be written in the form

Applying assumptions (i), (iv), the inequalities (3.2), (3.3) and the positivity
of the double integrals in equation (3.7), there exists a positive constant K

for all t ≥ 0, x, y and z. We have the following conclusions emanating from
inequality (3.8):
(i) Inequality(3.8)establishesthelowerinequalityin(3.5)withK

to D

(ii) It is clear from the inequality (3.8) that

Furthermore, φ(t) ≤ φ

for all t ≥ 0, h

for all x 6= 0, and from the
inequality 2mn≤ m

for all m,n∈R, it follows from (3.1), the existence
of positive constants K

3.1.
Proof of Theorem 3.1. Let (x

t
) be any solution of the system (1.2).
Fromtheinequalities(3.8),(3.12)and(3.18),assumptions(i)and(ii)ofLemma

bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded. This completes the proof of the
Theorem 3.1.
Next,wewillstateandproofexistenceanduniquenessresultsforthesystem

Theorem 3.2. If all conditions of the Theorem 3.1 are satisﬁed, then there
exists a periodic solution of the system (1.2) of period ω.
Proof. Let (x

t
) be any solution of the system (1.2), the proof of the
Theorem 3.2 will depend upon the same scalar valued functional deﬁned in
(3.1), as used in the proof of Lemma 3.1. In view of estimates (3.8), (3.11) and
(3.12) hypothesis (i) of Lemma 2.1 hold. Furthermore, using condition (vi) of

and (3.20) condition (ii) of Lemma 2.1 follows. Thus by Lemma 2.1 a periodic
solution of system (1.2) of period ω is assured. This completes the proof of the
Theorem 3.2.
Theorem 3.3. If all assumptions of the Theorem 3.1 hold, then for any given
initial value inR
3
there exists a unique solution of the system (1.2).
Proof. Let (x
t
,y
t
,z
t
) be any solution of the system (1.2), the proof of the
Theorem 3.3 also depends on the continuously differentiable functional (3.1).
From inequalities (3.8), (3.9) and (3.10) conditions (i) and (ii) of Lemma 2.2
hold. Furthermore, from inequalities (3.19) and (3.20), we obtain
V
′
(1.2)
≤ 0, (3.21)
for all t≥ 0,x,y and z. Inequality (3.21) satisﬁes condition (iii) of Lemma 2.2,
hence by Lemma 2.2, the existing solution of the system (1.2) is unique. This
completes the proof of the Theorem 3.3.
Next, we will establish the bound on the solution (x

(1.2).

Then every solution (x

) of the system (1.2) is uniformly bounded and
x

as t→∞.
Proof. Let(x

orem 3.5 depends on the functional V deﬁned in the equation (3.1). Theorem
3.1 established uniform boundedness of solution (x

From the inequality (3.19), we deﬁne a positive deﬁnite function (or wedge) as

and

Since φ(t)≤φ

Since f

follows that F(t,X

and (ii)

of the Theorem3.5 and the fact that

Theorem 3.6. If conditions (i) to (v) of the Theorem 3.1 hold, then the zero

Proof. Let (x

t
) be any solution of the system (3.34). The main tool in
theproofoftheTheorem3.6isthefunctionalV oftheequation(3.1). Fromthe
inequalities (3.8) and (3.12), condition (i) of Lemma 2.3 hold. Setting p

asymptotically stable. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.6.

Corollary 3.1. If conditions (i) to (v) of the Theorem 3.1 hold, and condition
(vi) is replaced by boundedness of the function p(t), then the solution (x
t
,y
t
,z
t
)
of the system (3.36) is uniformly bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded.
Corollary 3.2. If conditions (i) to (v) of the Theorem 3.1 are satisﬁed and in
addition the function p(t,x,y,z) is bounded, then the solution (x
t

) of the
system (3.37) is uniformly bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded.
Proof. The Proofs of Corollaries 3.1 and 3.2 are similar to the proof of the
Theorem 3.1, hence they are omitted.
In what follows, we give two examples to justify our obtained results.

From items (i) to (vi) of Example 4.1, all assumptions of the Theorems 3.1 to
3.5 hold. Thus their respective conclusion follows for the system (4.2). Also,
from items (i) to (v) of Example 4.1, conditions of the Theorem 3.6 hold. Thus
by the Theorem 3.6, the trivial solution of the system (4.2) is uniformly asymp-

From items (i) to (vi) of the Example 4.2 all assumptions of the Theorems
3.1 to 3.5 hold. Thus their respective conclusion follows for the system (4.4).
Also, from items (i) to (v) of the Example 4.2, conditions of the Theorem 3.6
hold. Thus by Theorem 3.6 the trivial solution of the system (4.4) is uniformly
asymptotically stable.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we study the behaviour of solutions for a certain third order
nonlinear differential equations with multiple deviating arguments. Suﬃcient
conditions for the existence of a unique solution that is periodic, uniformly
asymptotically stable, uniformly ultimately bounded are established by virtue
ofacompleteLyapunovfunctional. Asapplications,twoexamplesarepresented
to illustrate the main results.
