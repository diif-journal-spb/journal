Abstract.
The weak shadowing property was introduced by R.M. Corless and S.Yu.
Pilyugin and studied by these authors, K. Sakai, O.B. Plamenevskaya and oth-
ers. It was shown by Plamenevskaya that for omega-stable diffeomorphisms
this property may be bount to the numerical properties of the eigenvalues of
the hyperbolic saddle points of the diffeomorphisms.
In this paper, we prove that if the phase diagram of an omega-stable dif-
feomorphism of a manifold does not contain chains of length more than three,
then it has the weak shadowing property.

1 Introduction
Theweakshadowingpropertyofdynamicalsystemswasintroducedin[1],where
it was shown that this property is C
0
-generic.
The study of the weak shadowing property for Ω-stable diffeomorphisms is
essentially complicated: it was shown by Plamenevskaya [2] (see below) that
this property may be bount to the numerical properties of the eigenvalues of
hyperbolic saddle points of the diffeomorphisms.
In this paper we prove Theorem 2.1 stating that Ω-stable diffeomorphisms
(on manifolds of arbitrary dimension) having only “short” connections in phase
diagrams have the weak shadowing property.
2 Deﬁnitions and main results
Let M be a closed smooth manifold with Riemannian metric dist. Denote by
U(a,A) the a-neighborhood of a set A⊂M.
Denote by Diff
1
(M) the space of diffeomorphisms of M with the C
1
topol-
ogy. For a diffeomorphism f, we denote by O(x,f) the trajectory of x.
A sequence ξ ={x
k
:k ∈Z}⊂M is called a d-pseudotrajectory of f if
dist(f(x
k
),x
k+1
)<d, k ∈Z.
We say that a point x∈M  -shadows the pseudotrajectory ξ if
dist(f
k
(x),x
k
)< , k ∈Z.
We say that a point x∈M weakly  -shadows ξ if
ξ ⊂U( ,O(x,f)).
Now we give deﬁnitions of the main properties which we study.

  > 0, there exists d > 0 such that any d-pseudotrajectory is  -shadowed by
some point of M.
We say that f has the weak shadowing property if, given  > 0, there exists
d> 0 such that any d-pseudotrajectory is weakly  -shadowed by some point of
M.
Remark 2.1. Let us note that the property deﬁned above was called the ﬁrst
weak shadowing property in [3], where the second weak shadowing property,
Electronic Journal.  90Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2005
“symmetric” to the ﬁrst one, was introduced: we say that f has the second
weak shadowing property if, given   > 0, there exists d > 0 such that for any
d-pseudotrajectory ξ of f, there is a point x such that
O(x,f)⊂U( ,ξ).
It was shown in [3] that any dynamical system with compact phase space has
the second weak shadowing property, hence the study of this property in the
context of our paper is senseless. For this reason, we use below the term “weak
shadowing property” introduced in [1].
Of course, if a diffeomorphism has the shadowing property, it has the weak
shadowing property as well. An example of irrational rotation on the circle
shows that the inverse statement does not hold.
The following example constructed by Plamenevskaya [2] gives us useful
information concerning weak shadowing in Ω-stable systems.
Example. RepresentT
2
as the square [−2,2]×[−2,2] with identiﬁed opposite
sides. Let g :T
2
→T
2
be a diffeomorphism with the following properties:
(1) the nonwandering set Ω(g) of g is the union of 4 hyperbolic ﬁxed points;
that is, Ω(g) = {p
1
, p
2
, p
3
, p
4
}, where p
1
is a source, p
4
is a sink, and p
2
, p
3
are saddles;
(2) with respect to coordinates (v,w) ∈ [−2,2]×[−2,2], the following condi-
tions hold:
(2.1) p
1
= (1,2), p
2
= (1,0), p

= (−1,0), p

(2.2) W

) ={−1}×(−2,2),
where W
s
(p
i
) and W
u
(p
i
) are the stable and unstable manifolds, respectively,
deﬁned as usual;
(2.3) there exist neighborhoods U

(2.5) the eigenvalues of D
p
3
g are −μ, ν with μ > 1, 0 < ν < 1, and the
eigenvalues of D
p
2
g are −λ, κ with 0<λ< 1, κ> 1.
It was proved in [2] that g has the weak shadowing property if and only if
the number logλ/logμ is irrational. Note that g satisﬁes Axiom A and the no-
cycle condition (i.e., it is Ω-stable) but does not have the shadowing property.
Letf be an Axiom A diffeomorphism ofM. By the Smale Spectral Decom-
position Theorem, the nonwandering set Ω(f) can be represented as a ﬁnite
union of basic sets Ω
i
. Denote by W
s
(Ω
i
) and W
u
(Ω
i
) the stable and unstable
“manifolds” of Ω
i
. For two different basic sets Ω
i
and Ω
j
, we write Ω
i
→ Ω
j
if
W
u
(Ω
i
)∩W
s
(Ω
j
)6=∅.
Let us say that the phase diagram of the diffeomorphism f contains a chain of
length m if there exist m different basic sets Ω
i
1
,...,Ω
i
m
such that
Ω
i
1
→···→ Ω
i
m
.
Theorem 2.1. Assume that a diffeomorphism f satisﬁes Axiom A and
the no-cycle condition. If its phase diagram does not contain chains of length
m> 3, then f has the weak shadowing property.
Note that the restriction on the lengths of chains in Theorem 2.1 is sharp:
the Ω-stable diffeomorphism in the Plamenevskaya example has a chain p
1
→
p
2
→ p
3
→ p
4
of length 4 in its phase diagram (and may fail to have the weak
shadowing property).
3 Proof of Theorem 2.1
Let us ﬁrst introduce some notation.
Denote byO
+
(x,f) andO
−
(x,f) the positive and negative semitrajectories
of x, respectively. Let ξ = {x
k
: k ∈Z} be a pseudotrajectory and let l,m be
indices with l≤m. We denote
ξ
l,m
={x
k
:l≤k ≤m}, ξ
l

={x

The following three propositions are well known (Proposition 3.1 is the
classical Birkhoff theorem, for proofs of statements similar to Propositions 3.2
and 3.3, see [4], for example).
Electronic Journal.  92Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2005
Proposition 3.1. Let f be a homeomorphism of a compact topological
space X and U be a neighborhood of its nonwandering set. Then there exists a
positive number N such that
card{k :f
k
(x) / ∈U}≤N
for any x∈X, where cardA is the cardinality of a set A.
In Propositions 3.2, 3.3, 3.2p and 3.3p, we assume that f is an Ω-stable
diffeomorphismofaclosedsmoothmanifold(belowweapplythesepropositions
both to f and f
−1
).
Proposition 3.2. If Ω
i
is a basic set, then for any neighborhood U of Ω
i
we can ﬁnd its neighborhood V with the following property: if for some x ∈ V
and m> 0, f
m
(x) / ∈U, then f
m+k
(x) / ∈V for k ≥ 0.
Proposition 3.2. There exist neighborhoods U
i
of the basic sets Ω
i
such
that if f
m
(U
i
)∩U
j
6=∅ for some m> 0, then there exist basic sets Ω
l
1
,...,Ω
l
k
such that
Ω
i
→ Ω
l
1
→···→ Ω
l
k
→ Ω
j
.
Obviously, these propositions have the following analogs for pseudotrajec-
tories.
Proposition 3.1p. Let f be a homeomorphism of a compact metric space
X and U be a neighborhood of its nonwandering set. Then there exist positive
numbersd,N such that ifξ ={x
k
}⊂X is ad-pseudotrajectory andξ
l,m
∩U =∅
for some l,m with l≤m, then m−l≤N.
Proposition 3.2p. If Ω
i
is a basic set, then for any neighborhood U of Ω
i
we
can ﬁnd its neighborhood V and a number d> 0 with the following property: if
ξ = {x
k
} is a d-pseudotrajectory of f, x
0
∈ V, and x
m
/ ∈ U for some m > 0,
then ξ
m
+
∩V =∅.
Proposition 3.3p. There exist neighborhoods U
i
of the basic sets Ω
i
and a
number d > 0 with the following property: if ξ = {x
k
} is a d-pseudotrajectory
of f such that x
0
∈U
i
and x
m
∈U
j
for some m> 0, then there exist basic sets
Ω
l

,...,Ω
l
k
such that
Ω
i
→ Ω
l

l
k
→ Ω
j
.

In what follows, we assume that f is an Ω-stable diffeomorphism. We
need the following auxiliary statement. Let us say that f has the usual shad-
owing property on a set A if, given   > 0, there exists d > 0 such that if
ξ = {x
k
} is a d-pseudotrajectory of f with ξ
l,m
⊂ A, then there exists x such
that dist(x
k
,f
k
(x))<  for l≤k ≤m. Since any basic set Ω
i
is hyperbolic, we
may assume that f has the usual shadowing property on all neighborhoods of
Ω
i
considered below.
Lemma. Let Ω
i
be a basic set and let U
i
be a neighborhood of Ω
i
such that
U
i
∩Ω
j
=∅ for i6=j. For any positive α, there exists d> 0 with the following
property: if ξ = {x
k
} is a d-pseudotrajectory of f with ξ
+
⊂ U
i
, then there
exists a point z and an open set D containing z such that
(1) dist(x
0
,z)<α;
(2) ξ
+
⊂U(α,O
+
(z
0
,f)) for any z
0
∈D.
Proof. Fix arbitrary α> 0. Reducing α, if necessary, we may assume that
U(α,U
i
)∩Ω
j
=∅
for j 6=i. Applying the usual shadowing property on U
i
, let us ﬁnd d> 0 such
that if ξ = {x
k
} is a d-pseudotrajectory of f with ξ
+
⊂ U
i
, then there exists
y such that dist(x
k
,f
k
(y)) < α/4 for k ≥ 0. By the choice of α, O
+
(y,f) ⊂
U(α,U
i
), hence y ∈ W
s
(Ω
i
). Thus, there exists p ∈ Ω
i
such that y ∈ W
s
(p).
In any neighborhood of p, there is a point q such that its trajectory is dense
in Ω
i
. Stable manifolds of points of a hyperbolic set depend continuously on
the point, hence any neighborhood of y contains a point z such that O
+
(z,f)
is dense in Ω
i
.
There exists a number K > 0 such that f
k
(y) ∈ U(α/4,Ω
i
) for k ≥ K.
Find a point z such that
(1) dist(f
k
(y),f
k
(z))<α/2 for 0≤k ≤K;
(2) O
+
(z,f) is dense in Ω
i
.
There exists a numberL> 0 such that for any pointp∈ Ω
i
there is a point
r ∈{f
k
(z) : 0≤ k ≤ L} with dist(p,r) < α/4. By the continuity of f, there is
an open set D containing z such that Ω
i
⊂U(α/2,O
+
(z
0
,f)) for any z
0
∈D.
To complete the proof, it remains to take D so small that
dist(f
k
(y),f
k
(z
0
))<α/2 for 0≤k ≤K and z
0
∈D.

Remark 3.1. Let Ω
i
be an attractor. Fix  > 0 and ﬁnd a neighborhood U
i
of
Ω
i
such that
U
i
⊂U( /2,Ω
i
) (1)
and f(U
i
) ⊂ U
i
. There exist numbers d,a > 0 (depending only on U
i
) such
that if ξ ={x
k
} is a d-pseudotrajectory of f with x
0
∈U
i
, then ξ
+
⊂U
i
, there
is a point y ∈W
s
(Ω
i
) such that dist(f
k
(y),x
k
)< /4, and W =U(a,x
1
)⊂U
i
.
Since points z for which O
+
(z,f) is dense in Ω
i
are dense in W, the same
reasoning as in the proof of the lemma above shows that the set
W
0
={x∈W :ξ
1
+
⊂U( ,O
+
(x,f))}
is open and dense in W.
Of course, a similar statement holds for a repeller Ω
i
.
In the proof of Theorem 2.1, we have to consider d-pseudotrajectories with
decreasing values of d. We use the same notation of points of these pseudotra-
jectories, of their neighborhoods, etc; this will lead to no confusion.
Let m be the maximal length of chains in the phase diagram of the con-
sidered Ω-stable diffeomorphism f. If there are no chains of length 2, then the
statementofourtheoremistrivial–inthiscase,f isanAnosovdiffeomorphism.
Let us consider the case where m = 2. In this case, any basic set is either
a repeller or an attractor. Consider a repeller Ω
1
and an attractor Ω
2
. Fix an

The set U
0

= f(U
2
)\f
2
(U
2
) is a compact subset of U
2
disjoint from Ω

Hence, there exists a number a

of Ω

such that
U(a

(and similar statements hold for U
1
etc).
It follows from Propositions 3.1p-3.3p that there exist numbers d
2
∈ (0,d
1
)
and N such that if ξ ={x
k
} is a d
2
-pseudotrajectory of f, then only one of the
following possibilities holds:
(I) there exists a basic set Ω
i
such that ξ ⊂U
i
;
(II) there exists a repeller Ω
1
and an attractor Ω
2
such that, for the neighbor-
hoods described above, there exist integers l,m with 0≤m−l ≤N such
that

\V

and U(a

m
)⊂U
2
\V
2
.
Case (I) is trivial since a basic set contains a dense trajectory (and, by
condition (3.1), ξ belongs to the  -neighborhood of such a trajectory).
To consider case (II), ﬁnd positive numbers a
3
< a
1
and d
3
< d
2
such that
for any points x,y with dist(x,y) < a

Let ξ ={x

are open and dense subsets of W

and W

By our choice of d

m−l
(W

and dist(f

) <   for l ≤ k ≤ m, hence ξ ⊂ U( ,O(x,f)). This com-
pletes the consideration of the case m = 2.
Finally, we considerthe casem = 3. Fix > 0. ItfollowsfromPropositions
3.1p – 3.3p that there exist numbers d

of the
basic sets Ω

such that inclusions (1) hold and, for any d

(P1) there exists an index i such that ξ ⊂U

;
(P2) there exist a repeller Ω

, and indices l,m with l <m such
that m−l≤N, ξ

, and ξ

⊂U

;
(P3.1) there exist a repeller Ω

, a saddle basic set (i.e., a basic set that is not an
attractor or repeller) Ω

, and indicesl,m withl <m such thatm−l≤N,
ξ

(P3.2) there exist a saddle basic set Ω

(P4) there exist a repeller Ω

⊂ U

ξ
m,n
⊂U
j
, and ξ
t

⊂U
s
.
For possibilities (P1) and (P2), the proof is just the same as in the case
m = 2.
Let us consider possibility (P3.1) (the same reasoning is applicable for
(P3.2)). Similarly to the proof for the case m = 2, we can ﬁnd a
i

> 0
such that, for any d

Applying the lemma (with α = a

with the following
property: for any d

such that ξ

Applying the remark after the lemma, we may assume that, for any d

is open and dense in W
i
. Its image, f
m−l+1
(W

i
), contains W
j
(and hence, there
is a point x belonging to the intersection of this image with the open subset D
of W
j
).
It follows from our constructions that ξ ⊂ U( ,O(x,f)). This completes
the consideration of possibility (P3.1).
Finally, we have to consider possibility (P4). Fix a repeller Ω
i
, a saddle
basic set Ω
j
, and an attractor Ω
s
for which there exists a d

ξ and indices l,m,n,t with l < m < n < t such that m−l ≤ N, t−n ≤ N,

We may assume that the neighborhoods U

satisfy inclusions (1).
In addition, we assume that for d

-pseudotrajectories with d
2

and for
numbers a
i

s
∈ (0, ), all of the statements similar to statements in the proof
for the case m = 2 (II) are valid (with natural replacement of U
1
,U
2
, etc by
U
i
,U
s
, etc).
To be exact, we assume that if ξ is a d

ξ

= U(a

subsets of U
i

Now let us ﬁnd numbers d
3
< d

and a
j
> 0 such that, for any point x
r
of a d
3
-pseudotrajectory ξ and for any point y such that dist(y,x
r
) < a
j
, the
inequalities
dist(f
k
(y),x
r+k
)< min(a
i
,a
s
)
hold if |k|≤N.
In addition, since f has the usual shadowing property on U
j
and ξ
m,n
⊂U
j
,
we may assume that there exists a point y such that dist(f
k
(y),x
m+k
)<a
j
for
0≤k ≤n−m (note that the value n−m may be arbitrarily large, in contrast
to the values m−l and t−n not exceeding N).
Denote W
j,1
= U(a
j

m
) and W
j,2
= U(a
j
,x
n
). By the choice of a
j
, V
i
=
f
l−m
(W
j,1
) ⊂ W
i
and V
s
= f
t−n
(W
j,2
) ⊂ W
s
. Hence, the intersection V
0

=
V

∩W

i
is open and dense in V
i
, and the intersection V
0
s
=V
s
∩W

is open and
dense in V

. It follows that the image V

(V

and the image V

=f
n−t

The theorem is proved.
Remark 3.2. Analyzing the proof of Theorem 2.1, it is easy to see that a
similar statement holds for an Ω-stable diffeomorphism f under the following
