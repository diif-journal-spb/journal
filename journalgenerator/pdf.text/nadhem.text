Abstract
This paper presents a simple and e cient method for determining the solution of Riccati differ-
ential equation with coe cients rational. In case the differential Galois group of the differential
equation (E
l
) : y
00
= ry; r2 C(x) is reducible, we look for the rational solutions of Riccati
differential equation 
0
+ 
2
=r, by reducing the number of check to be made and by accelerat-
ing the search for the partial fraction decomposition of the solution reserved for the poles of  
which are false poles of r. This partial fraction decomposition of solution can be used to code
r. The examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

The quadratic Riccati differential equation :

where p

and p

are in a differential  eld K; p

equation is  rst converted to a reduced Riccati differential equation :
(E

) :

where :   = p

order linear ordinary differential equation :
(E

=ry (3)Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2013
If we have a particular solution non-zero of (E
l
) then general solution is : y = cu where
c

=
 
u

;   constant (see[ 6,9,14]).
In paper, we base ourselves mainly on the work of J.J. Kova~ ci  c [9] where differential Galois
group of the differential equation (E
l
) is reducible and we take : K =C(X).
In case where every solution of (E
l
) is Liouvillian corresponds to the case where reduced
Riccati differential equation (E
r
) have algebraic solution over K. The case where differential
Galois group is reducible corresponds to the case where the Riccati differential equation (E
r
)
have the rational solution
u

). The solution u of (E

The  eldC(X)[u] is differential extension ofC(X) by exponential of an integral and if v

then (u;v) two solutions of (E
l
) linearly independent over  eld of constants C. The ordinary
extension C(X)[u;v] is differential extension of C(X)[u], by a integral. C(X)[u;v] is Picard-
Vessiot extension of C(X)[u] for the differential equation(E
l
)(see[8-9-10]). The existence of
rational solution

This paper presents a simple and e cient method for determining the solution of Riccati
differential equation with coe cients rational. In case the differential Galois group of the
differential equation (E
l
) :y
00
=ry; r2C(x) is reducible, we look for the rational solutions of
Riccati differential equation  
0
+ 
2
= r, by reducing the number of check to be made and by
accelerating the search for the partial fraction decomposition of the solution reserved for the
poles of  which are false poles ofr. This partial fraction decomposition of solution can be used
to code r. The examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.
2 Form of rational solution of equation : (E

)
Let r2C(x) r6= 0 rational fraction and  2C(x) the rational solution of Riccati differential
equation (E

) :  
0
+

=r.
2.1 Study in the pole c of multiplicity   of

Thus, c is double pole of r and the residue of   at simple pole c equal:

case 1 : We assume that : d

We have : d

If : lim

So E(r) constant equal E( )

We put :
