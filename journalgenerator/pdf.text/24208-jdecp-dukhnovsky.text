Abstract. In this paper, we consider the discrete kinetic Carleman system.
The Carleman system is the Boltzmann kinetic equation, and for this model
momentum and energy are not conserved. Using group analysis methods, we
obtainasolutionrepresentingthedensityofgasparticlesinacertainarea. This
limitation is due to the non-negativity of solution. Similarly, it is possible to
ﬁnd exact solutions for other kinetic models.
Keywords: Carleman system, group analysis, invariant solution
1 Introduction
We consider the one-dimensional Carleman system [9, 15]:
∂
t
u+∂
x
u =
1
ε
(v
2
−u
2
), x ∈R, t > 0,
∂
t
v −∂
x
v = −
1
ε
(v
2
−u

).

Here u = u(x,t),v = v(x,t) are the densities of two groups of particles with
velocities c = 1,−1, ε is the Knudsen parameter from the kinetic theory of
gases. This system describes a monatomic rareﬁed gas consisting of two groups
of particles. The Carleman system is a non-integrable system, i.e. the Painlev´ eDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N. 2, 2024
test is not applicable. The interaction is as follows. The Carleman system
describes particles of two groups, namely, the ﬁrst group of particles moves at
a unit speed along the axis Ox, and the second group moves at a unit speed in
the opposite direction. It is worth noting that only particles within one group
interact, that is, only with themselves, changing the direction of motion.
The method of group analysis is a well-known method for ﬁnding solu-
tions, in particular invariant solutions of equations of mathematical physics.
This method is described in detail in [1, 2, 3, 5]. A general description of the
Boltzmann equation is described in the article [4]. In this works [6, 7], Ilyin
O. V. obtained an optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras and classes
of invariant solutions for the stationary kinetic Broadwell model and the one-
dimensional Boltzmann integro-differential equation for Maxwellian particles
with inelastic collisions. In [8] the results of group analysis of the multidimen-
sionalBoltzmannandVlasovequationsarepresented. Also, solutionsofkinetic
systems using Painlev´ e series were found in [9, 10, 11, 15, 16]. Asymptotic sta-
bility for Boltzmann models as well as the numerical study are presented in
[14, 17, 18, 19]. The analysis described in this paper provides solutions of the
Carleman system that have not yet been found in the literature.
2 Method of group analysis
We consider a system of two second order partial differential equations
F

where u = u(x,t),v = v(x,t) are unknown functions. According to the group
analysis methods, we will look for the prolonged operator in the form

is called the inﬁnitesimal operator of the group. A universal invariant of the
group and the operator (4) is a function I(x,t,u,v)

4 Conclusion
In this article, the solution was found using group analysis methods. We de-
termined three different inﬁnitesimal groups of transformations leaving the in-
variant condition. A well-known and very important special class of invariant
solutions was represented by self similar solution which was constructed on the
basis of invariants of extension groups. Future work will present solutions to
the remaining kinetic systems.
