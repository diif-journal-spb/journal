Abstract. In this paper, we investigate by means of second method of Lya-
punov, su cient conditions that guarantee uniform-asymptotic stability of the
trivial solution and ultimate boundedness of all solutions to a certain second
order differential equation. We construct a complete Lyapunov function in or-
der to discuss the qualitative properties mentioned earlier. The boundedness
result in this paper is new and also complement some boundedness results in
literature obtained by using an incomplete Lyapunov function together with a
signum function. Finally, we demonstrate the correctness of our results with two
numerical examples and graphical representation of the trajectories of solutions
to the examples using Maple software.
Keywords: Second order, Stability, Boundedness, Lyapunov function.
1 Introduction
Our concern in this paper is to investigate su cient conditions for the stability
and boundedness of solutions to the second order differential equation of theDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023

A. M. Lyapunov (1892) in his Ph.D. Thesis titled " The general problems of
the stability of motion", studied su cient conditions for the stability of solu-
tions of non-linear system of differential equations by two distinct methods: the
 rst(or indirect) and second(or direct) methods of Lyapunov (Lyapunov [12]).
Since these two methods were introduced, the second method has gained wider
acceptance and has been employed in all the listed papers in our reference to
study qualitative behaviour of solutions of differential equations(see, [1]-[23]).
This method (i.e. the second method) enables us to determine the qualitative
properties of solutions of differential equations without necessarily  nding the
solutions themselves.
However, to use the second method of Lyapunov, one needs to construct
a positive de nite function, whose derivative with respect to variable t along
the solution path of the equation being considered is negative semi-de nite.
This positive de nite function is called Lyapunov function. Unfortunately, the
method is not without any di culty or challenge. One major challenge of the
method has to do with, how to construct a suitable Lyapunov function espe-
cially for non-linear differential equations.
In [19], Tejumola gave necessary conditions for the boundedness of solutions
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.304 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 60Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
to the following scalar differential equations:
_ x =h(y);
_ y = f(x;y)y g(x) +p(t;x;y): (2)
We note that system (2) is the scalar form of system (1). Later Omeike et.
al. [14] with the aid of an incomplete Lyapunov function supplemented with
signum function, extended the boundedness results obtained by Tejumola[19]
to the corresponding n-dimensional system of equations given in (1).
Very recent, Adeyanju([2],[3]) examined some conditions for the stability of
the zero solution, boundedness and uniform-ultimate boundedness of solutions
of the second order non-linear differential equation:

where X : R

and F is an
n n continuous symmetric positive de nite matrix function that depends on
the arguments displayed explicitly. The boundedness property of solutions to
(3) has also been studied by Omeike et. al.[15].
Motivated by the works of Tejumola [19] and Omeike et.al. [14], we will with
the aid of a complete Lyapunov function, examine conditions that ensure the
boundedness of solutions of (1) with less restricted assumptions. Furthermore,
we will also prove a theorem on the stability of the trivial solution to the system
(1) which was not discussed in [14] or elsewhere to the best of our knowledge
in literature.

Now to the main results of the paper.
Theorem 1 Suppose all the assumptions listed under the basic assumptions
hold. Then the trivial solution of (1) is uniformly stable and uniformly-
asymptotically stable when P (t;X;Y )  0.
Proof
To prove this theorem, we depend on the continuously-differentiable scalar func-
tion V =V (t;X;Y ) de ne as
V =a(t)hX;Xi +

hH( Y );Yid ; (4)
where a(t) and   are as de ned under the basic assumptions.
Obviously, the Lyapunov function de ned in (4) becomes zero when X = 0
and Y = 0. On applying Lemma 1, Lemma 2 and assumptions listed in (i) of
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.304 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 63Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023

Inequalities (5) and (6) show that the scalar function V is non-negative for all

and V = 0 if and only if X = 0 and Y = 0.
Next, we show that the derivative
_

there are  nite constants D

Using Lemma 3, we obtain the time derivative of the scalar function de ned in
(4) along the system (1) as

The two inequalities (5) and (10) guarantee uniform stability of the trivial so-
lution of (1).
To prove the asymptotic stability of the trivial solution, we consider a set de nes
by
S f(X;Y ) :
_
V (X;Y ) = 0g:
Applying the famous LaSalle's invariance principle to this set, we note that
(X;Y )2 S implies that X = Y = 0. This shows that the largest invariant
set contained in S is (0; 0). Hence, we conclude by Lemma 4 that the trivial
solution of (1) is uniformly-asymptotically stable when P (t;X;Y )  0. This
completes the proof of the theorem.

proof
The prove of this theorem still rests on the Lyapunov function de ned in (4).
In the proof of Theorem 1, we have demonstrated that the Lyaounov function
satis es (5) which is also correct when P (t;X;Y )6= 0: However, the derivative
of V when P (t;X;Y )6= 0 is

V =a

By following the Yoshizawa-type technique used in [[13], [23] ], it can be shown
from inequalities (5) and (12) that we can always  nd a positive constant D

On setting K =

completes the proof of the theorem.

Again, all the assumptions of Theorem 2 hold. Hence, solutions of equation in

Graphically, with the aid of Maple software, we illustrate the stability and
boundedness of solutions to the Example 2 as shown below.
5 Conclusion
By constructing a new and complete Lyapunov function, we have been able to
prove some results on the uniform-asymptotic stability of the trivial solution
and uniform-ultimate boundedness of all solutions to certain systems of second
order differential equations studied in this paper. With these new results, we
have improved on some of the existing results in the literature.
