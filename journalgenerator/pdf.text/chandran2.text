Abstract
The natural convection in an incompressible viscous uid owing near a
semi-in nite impermeable vertical plate has been investigated. Assuming that
the uid-plate system is undergoing a rigid-body rotation, the nonlinear set of
governing boundary layer momentum and thermal equations has been solved
using an appropriate implicit  nite difference numerical scheme. The effect of
the rotation parameter on the developing ow has been discussed in detail forDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2009

computed and analysed.
1 Introduction
Investigation of the natural convection transport processes involving the cou-
pling of the uid ow and heat transfer has attracted the attention of several
researchers because of its varied applications in many engineering  elds and
naturally occurring systems. Rotation effects on natural convection ows are
inportant in many engineering applications such as nuclear power plants, cool-
ing of nuclear reactors and electronic systems, atmospheric re-entry of space
vehicles, gas turbines, spin-stabilised missiles and various propulsion devices for
missiles, satellites and space vehicles. Natural convection in a rotating system
also  nds applications in petroleum engineering for observing the movement
of oil and gas through a reservoir. Among the theoretical studies related to
natural convection in viscous incompressible uids, the convection taking place
near vertical plates | both of in nite as well as semi-in nite extent | has
been extensively dealt with in literature. Most of these studies have focused
on ow near an in nite plate or between two vertical walls. However, when
the convection takes place near a semi-in nite vertical plate, the analysis of
the governing uid dynamical equations becomes more challenging, generally
requiring numerical treatment.
Steady free convection ow of a viscous incompressible uid past a semi-
in nite vertical wall was  rst discussed by Pohlhausen [1] using an integral
method. Decades later, Ostrach [2] studied the same problem by obtaining
similarity solutions of the governing equations. Unsteady free convective mo-
tion of a viscous incompressible uid bounded by a semi-in nite vertical wall
has been presented by Siegel [3] and Gebhart [4] by incorporating the integral
and approximation methods, respectively. Mass transfer effects on the develop-
ing free convective ow past a semi-in nite at plate has been investigated by
Callahan and Marner [5] using an explicit  nite difference method. This prob-
lem has also been analysed by Soundalgekar and Ganesan [6] using an implicit
 nite difference method. These authors have demonstrated that the two meth-
ods yield comparable results. Raptis et al. [7] have presented numerical solution
of transient free convective ow in a porous medium bounded by a semi-in nite
vertical plate. They used an explicit  nite difference algorithm. Singh and Rai
[8] solved the governing equations of free convective ow of water at 4

semi-in nite vertical plate. Free convection heat transfer near the leading edge
of an isothermal semi-in nite vertical at plate with  nite thickness has been
investigated numerically by Miyamoto and Akiyoshi [9]. The effect of variable
surface temperature on the free convection in a viscous uid past a semi-in nite
plate has been discussed by Takhar et al. [10]. Recently, the present authors
[11, 12] considered the effect of temporally ramped temperature distribution
on free convection under the same geometrical con guration, and brought out
certain features of the ow for a range of values of Prandtl number.
In the present work, we consider transient free convective ow of a viscous
incompressible uid past a semi-in nite vertical wall. It is assumed that the
convection is set up by a change in the temperature of the wall from that of the
uid temperature. The main thrust of this study is to analyse the effect of rigid
body rotation of the plate-uid system. The problem | formulated in terms
of a nonlinear initial-boundary-value problem | has been solved numerically
using an implicit  nite difference method of Crank-Nicolson type.

are constant except that the inuence of the density variation with temperature
is included in the body force term. Under the usual Boussenesq approximation,
the governing conservation equations for the continuity, momentum and energy,
near the vertical plate, can be obtained from Ker and Lin [13] in the form

3 Numerical solution procedure
The non-linearity of the partial differential equations governing the ow suggests
that solutions of the equations must be sought numerically. The simultaneous
non-linear partial differential equations (7){(10) with conditions (12) are to be
solved for the dependent variables u; v; w; T as functions of x; z and t:
Of particular interest is also the steady state solution if it exits. We use here
the implicit  nite difference method of Crank-Nicolson type for the numerical
solution. The  nite difference equations corresponding to equations (8){(10) are
transformed into a system of equations in tridiagonal form after some algebraic
manipulations and, then, they are solved by the Thomas algorithm.
The space under consideration has been restricted to  nite dimensions. Here
a plate of height x
max
= 20 and z
max
= 20 have been considered. As the large
number of grid points yield a better estimate of the dependent variables, we
have taken a grid of size 201  201 to evaluate the variables. Computations
have been carried out for a uid of Prandtl number 0.71 (which corresponds to
air). During any one time step, the computed values of the previous time step
have been used for the coe cients u and w appearing in the equations (8){(10).
At the end of each time step,  rst the temperature  eld has been obtained
and then the evaluated values are employed to obtain the velocity components
in x- and y-directions. Finally, velocity component w in the z-direction is
obtained using equation (7). Unsteady values of the velocity and temperature
 elds corresponding to a particular time have been reported when the time is
achieved by iterative process. The process of computation is advanced until a
steady state is approached with respect to the temperature and velocity  elds
by satisfying the convergence criterion

In the numerical computation, special attention is required to specify  t
in order to get a steady state solution as soon as possible, yet small enough to
avoid instabilities. We set  t as
 t =   min( x
2
;  z
2
) (14)
where  x and  z are mesh sizes along the x and z directions, respectively.
The stabiliser parameter   is guessed by numerical experimentations in order
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal/ 73Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2009
to achieve convergence and stability of the solution procedure. A series of
numerical experiments has shown that assigning the value 2 to  is suitable for
numerical computations.
It is worth mentioning here that the numerical procedure used herein has
been seen to be quite satisfactory as far as its accuracy is concerned. To see
the accuracy and convergence of the results, the program was re-run by re ning
the grid system as well as the time step. For instance, when the program was
run with the 251  251 grid size with a smaller time step than used before, no
signi cant changes in the results were observed. Moreover, we were also able
to validate the numerical results for the special case when rotation was absent.
Having solved for the velocity and temperature variables, one can compute
the shear stress and heat transfer parameters at the vertical wall. The local
skin friction components in the x and y directions | denoted by

4 Results
Our main focus in this work is to determine the inuence of the rigid body
rotation on the developing uid motion. To this end, we have computed and
shown the effects of rotation parameter 
 and the non-dimensional time variable
t on various physical quantities of interest.
In Figs 1{3, we have presented the plots of velocity components u; v; w
versusz at a cross-sectionx = const: In these plots, the effects oft and 
 on the
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal/ 74Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2009
velocity components have been shown in detail. From Fig 1, we observe that
the velocity cmponent u increases near the vertical plate, attains a maximum,
and then decreases to its free-stream value in conformity with the boundary
layer feature. We further notice that 
 has a retarding effect onu for a  xedt:
However, ast increases, the effect of 
 onu becomes more pronounced. It may
also be noted that the peaks of these velocity curves shift progressively away
from the bounding wall as t increases. The behaviour of the y-component v of
velocity at the cross-section x = 10; is shown in Fig 2. The magnitude of v
increases with 
 for a  xed value of t: The behaviour ofjvj witht is similar to
that observed for theu-pro les. In Fig 3, we have shown pro les for the normal
velocity component w at the cross-section x = 5: Due to the rotation of the
bounding vertical plate, the uid is drawn towards it. The effect of rotation is
to enhance the magnitude of w; similar to that noticed for v:
As stated before, our main aim in this work has been to investigate the
effect of rigid body rotation on the natural convection near the semi-in nite
vertical plate. When rotation is absent (
 = 0), the secondary velocityv should
vanish for all values of t: This has further been con rmed from the numerical
solution of the system of equations (7){(10) in conjuction with equation (12).
It was seen that for this case, v becomes zero for all t: The values of the
other velocity components u and w undergo some variations when rotation is
absent. For illustrative purpose, we have shown in Fig (1a) the variation of the
velocity component u corresponding to 
 = 0: The velocity pro les u for this
particular case are in agreement with an earlier study reported in literature [14].
The pro les of u for the non-rotating and rotating cases are qualitatively very
similar, as can be seen from Figs 1 and (1a). However, the presence of rotation
tends to diminish the velocity, in agreement with our earlier observation.
In Fig 4, we have shown variation of the temperature of the uid for a set
of values of 
 andt | similar to the ones used in Figs 1{3. For a  xed value of
the parameter t; the effect of increase of rotation parameter is to enhance the
temperature in the boundary layer region. A similar behaviour is also observed
for the temperature when 
 is  xed and t increases. As a consequence, the
thermal boundary layer thickness increases proportionate to both 
 and t: In
Figs 5 and 6, we have plotted a number of isotherms (T = const: curves) in
the xz-plane corresponding to 
 = 0:05 and 0.1, respectively. Each of these
 gures includes the constant temperature pro les for four different temporal
situations. It is to be noted that the increase in the thermal boundary layer
thickness, stated earlier, is yet again conspicuous in the set of  gures 5{6.

Thus, the variation of these quantities has been exhibited in Figs 7{9. It may
be noted that increasing the rotation results in the desired reduction in the
