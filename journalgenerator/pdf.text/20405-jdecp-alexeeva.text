Abstract. The paper studies monetary and  scal policy rules consistent with
determinate equilibrium dynamics. W e consider a three-dimensional New Key-
nesian model in continuous time with Rotemberg price-setting mechanism and
non-Ricardian consumers, and study dynamics of the model under monetary and
 scal policies interactions. The key analytical  nding is that the uniqueness of the
equilibrium solution can be never achieved while both policies are in their active
regimes. Another combinations of policies’ regimes can lead to a local equilibrium
determinacy through control of appropriate v alues of T aylor coe cients ( f

and

making government debt a net asset leads to creation of an additional channel forDi er ential Equations and Contr ol Pr o c esses, N. 4, 2020

dynamics, limit cycle or more complicated attracting sets could appear, including
chaotic attractors of v arious natures.

1 Introduction
Mainstream macroeconomic analysis of both monetary and  scal policies relies
heavily on the New Keynesian model. New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic Gen-
eral Equilibrium (DSGE) models are typically set as systems of discrete time
expectational di erence equations [16, 45 47]. In contrast, typical continuous
time models in economics are deterministic dynamical systems, which compli-
cates consideration of the stochastic nature of economic development. Recently ,
there appeared several papers with DSGE models set in continuous time [12, 19].
One reason for this is that model in continuous time might be more suitable for
analytical investigation than the corresponding discrete time v ariant [20].
T raditionally , economists used discrete-time models for description of events
taking place at business cycle frequencies (see, e.g. [8, 35, 36]), while continuous
time modelling was restricted to the growth theory [15, 39, 44]. Still, for certain
purposes discrete-time and continuous-time models could be used interchangeably
and lead to similar model predictions. F or example, in [21] it is pointed out that
considering very short time periods in discrete-time models (for instance, one
day instead of a quarter) could lead to the same qualitative results as in the
corresponding continuous time model.
Recent monetary policy literature presents an example of a traditional (dis-
crete time)  eld that started to investigate implications of continuous time model-
ing: a whole sub eld of the Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) model-
ing depends on deriv ation and aggregation of the individual agents’ decision rules,
and is facilitated by the usage of continuous time modeling [12, 19, 20, 23]. HANK
appeared as conjunction of two directions: heterogeneous-agent (HA) and New
Keynesian (NK). In this framework researchers typically use quantitative models
(for instance, DSGE) involving heavy machinery for their resolution. However, it
is important to build simple and tractable models to gain analytical insights into
their underlying mechanisms and make their policy conclusions sharper and easier

to undestand [9, 10, 37]. Investigation of e ects of monetary and  scal policies in
liquidity trap (see, e.g., [52]) bene ted from ability to derive closed form results
in a deterministic continuous time model.
W e study a continuous-time model similar to [30]. This is a small New Key-
nesian model in which consumers face a constant probability of death that makes
government debt a net asset of the agents, introducing non-Ricardian features. In
contrast to Leith and von Thadden [30], we assume that the  rms set prices ac-
cording to Rotemberg price-setting mechanism [42] rather than that of Calvo [13].
Making this assumption allows to derive the exact nonlinear NK Phillips curve
and avoid linearization of the model.
The main contribution of the paper is to analyze local equilibrium determi-
nacy
1
of considered model under di erent monetary and  scal policies regimes.
W e also consider policy regimes combinations leading to explosive equilibrium; as
we derive the model in the exact nonlinear form, we are able to characterize the
nature of global indeterminacy that might appear in such a case.
In modern macroeconomics local equilibrium determinacy is often analyzed
as being in uenced by the monetary and/or  scal policy in the framework of a
standard NK model. It is important to empathize that NK models are predom-
inantly used in studies that analyze the e ects of monetary policy on the local
equilibrium determinacy . Several papers (see, e.g. [25, 43]) demonstrate that local
equilibrium determinacy is always ensured under an active monetary policy rule
(when monetary authority is aimed at stabilizing in ation). Nevertheless, in [22],
for instance, it is shown that there are some restrictions for monetary authorities
on policy rules which fail to guarantee the determinacy of local equilibrium. Au-
thors consider simple interest rate rule as well as other alternative forms of them
in a standard NK model in continuous time. As a result, they derive a set of pa-
rameters where the equilibrium is not determinate under active monetary policy .
Moreover, it is postulated in [22] that monetary policy should not be very active
in order to guarantee the determinacy of local equilibrium. The paper con rms
results of [14, 17] and demonstrates that  activeness  of monetary policy rule does
not necessary mean avoidance of indeterminacy . Moreover, all these papers pro-
vide results that multiple local equilibria can be achieved in case of combination
of endogenous capital accumulation and sticky prices.
However, all these studies do not take into consideration  scal aspects. One
of the earliest works where local equilibrium determinacy is studied under e ects

If an equilibrium is determinate, there is unique solution for the mo del’s v ariables. Th us, lo cally determinate

of both monetary and  scal policy rules is [32]. Leeper constructs a stochastic
maximizing model in discrete time and shows that local equilibrium determinacy
is achieved, when active monetary policy interacts with passive  scal policy and
vice versa. Later other studies con rmed Leeper’s results. F or instance, analysing
optimal monetary and  scal rules in NK model in discrete time, Schmitt-Grohe
and Uribe [48]  nd out that active monetary and passive  scal policies ensure the
uniqueness of the rational expectations equilibrium. In contrast to [32], they con-
sider a model with price stickiness, including money and distortionary taxation.
Kumhof and co-authors [29] study the in uence of policies’ rules on a unique
equilibrium from the side of  scal dominance: situation when  scal authorities
do not control tax revenues and spending. They consider model in discrete time
with transaction cost technologies and price stickiness and conclude that when
 scal policy is active, monetary policy should also react to public debt in order to
expand the set of unique equilibrium and improve welfare. The main message of
this study is that  scal policy does in uence local equilibrium determinacy and it
is a matter of great importance to maintain  scal discipline before introduction
of in ation targeting.
Discussed above papers study the uniqueness of equilibrium and policies’ in-
teraction using discrete time NK models. The same results are also con rmed in
studies where NK approach in continuous time models is considered [3, 5, 6, 51].
F or example, T suzuki [51] develops NK model in continuous time and studies
in uence of monetary and  scal policies’ lag on local equilibrium determinacy .
He constructs a delay-di erential equation system that models the economy with
money-in-the-production function and  nds out e ects from policies’ interaction
on equilibrium. The main  nding is that policy lags do matter in achieving local
equilibrium determinacy . Adding policy lag can lead to resolving of indeterminacy
under the combination of active monetary and passive  scal policies. Moreover,
it is pointed out that monetary and  scal authorities can act as substitutions. In
other words, for achieving determinacy in case indeterminacy occurs it is su cient
to shorten or lengthen a policy lag in only one policy rule.
Leith and von Thadden [30] consider NK model in continuous time with capi-
tal accumulation and non-Ricardian consumers. They study simple monetary and
 scal policy rules that lead to the determinacy of local equilibrium. They  nd
that the level of government debt in uences the analysis of equilibrium dynamics.
Moreover, for ensuring a determinate equilibrium it is necessary to determine the
level of the government debt. Depending on  high  or  low  debt the form of
monetary and  scal interaction that ensures the equilibrium determinacy is cho-

sen. It is demonstrated in [30] that threshold v alues of steady-state debt associate
with bifurcation parameters and it leads to qualitative changes in requirements
for local equilibrium determinacy .
Locally determinate equilibrium ensures that the solution for the agents’
choice v ariables is unique, and that their expectations are uniquely determined, as
well. Therefore, it is highly desired that economic policy delivered a determinate
equilibrium. Alternatively , investigation of policies that fail to achieve determi-
nate equilibrium is important for providing guidance to the policymakers. In this
regard, the analysis could be broadened to further investigation of a set of pa-
rameters that can lead to periodic, quasiperiodic and chaotic dynamics (including
hidden oscillations) [1, 2, 18, 26, 27, 34]. It was suggested that business cycles may
be largely driven by endogenous cyclical forces. In particular, Benhabib et. al. [7]
found that backward-looking interest rate feedback rules do not guarantee unique-
ness of equilibrium and present examples in which for plausible parameterizations
of the economy attracting equilibrium cycles exist. Barnett et. al. [3] provide an
evidence that in a New Keynesian (NK) model, an active interest rate feedback
monetary policy , when combined with a Ricardian passive  scal policy , may induce
occurrence of a Shilnikov chaotic attractor in the region of the parameter space
where uniqueness of the equilibrium prev ails locally . Beaudry et. al. [4] examine
the notion of stochastic limit cycles, wherein the system is bu eted by exogenous
shocks, but where the deterministic part of the system admits a limit cycle. Usage
of continuous time in models with endogenous cycles might be adv antageous, as
such models could be analyzed through developed tools of mathematical control
theory and stochastic di erential equations.
Our study expands on the literature by considering a model with Rotemberg
pricing (see, e.g., [31]), which allows to derive exactly a more compact system of
equations better suited to investigation of dynamic interactions between the  scal
and monetary policies. In our analysis we consider passive and active regimes for
both policies as per classi cation introduced by Leeper [32]. The main  ndings
of the paper are as follows. First, local equilibrium determinacy cannot obtain
when both policies are active. Second, local equilibrium determinacy in any other
policies’ combinations depends on ranges of f
F
and f
M
and can be achieved
only through appropriate choice of v alues of these parameters. Third, in contrast
to Ricardian equiv alence, considering government debt as a net asset leads to a
creation of an additional channel for  scal and monetary policy interaction and
changing conditions for local equilibrium determinacy .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the theoret-
Electronic Journal. h ttp://di journal.spbu.ru/ 92Di er ential Equations and Contr ol Pr o c esses, N. 4, 2020
ical model with Rotemberg price-setting mechanism and  nitely lived consumers.
Section 3 provides analysis of the system’s local equilibrium determinacy under
di erent policies’ regimes, the case for global indeterminacy , calibration of param-
eters and graphical analysis. Then, Section 4 concludes.
2 The model
The basic structure of the economy is considered as in [30]. The model describes
the economy where there are four main economic agents, namely representative
consumer, representative producer, the government and Central bank (CB). The
representative consumer maximizes its intertemporal utility function constrained
by the budget through choosing the level of consumption and labor. Operating in
monopolistic market, the representative producer maximizes its pro t. The pro-
ducer rents labor to manufacture goods and changes prices following Rotemberg
price-setting mechanism [42]. The government issues bonds, collects lump-sum
taxes and consumes. CB  xes one-period nominal interest rate. The government
and CB are responsible for  scal and monetary policies respectively . In what
follows, we set the problem for every agent and describe agents’ activities.

2.2 The representative producer problem
In the economy we consider the monopolistically competitive producer facing
Rotemberg [42] costs of price changes in every period. According to this, he has
to pay quadratic adjustment costs of price changes. These costs are set as follows:

where   measures the degree of price stickiness.
In order to eliminate resource costs of in ation we make an assumption that
adjustment costs of in ation are paid by producer as transfers to consumers (the
term

in the consumer’s optimization problem). T aking into consideration

; (22)
where index n means the natural rate. As in a usual model of monopolist price
setting, the monopolist’s price is higher than the marginal cost (higher than
W

t
in our case). The gross markup is given by
"

.
In order to bring the level of output to the socially optimal level, the govern-
ment could pay a subsidy to either price (thus paying it to the consumers) or to
the wage (therefore, making the  rms the subsidy’s recipients). In the latter case,
denoting the gross subsidy R and taking into account (22), the  rm will pay the
wage equal to W

clude part of the wages in the economy paid out as a subsidy . With productivity
equal to one at all times we obtain N = Y = C . Subsidy wage rate equals
marginal product of labor which equals one. Therefore, the government pays

order to make the model economically meaningful, it necessary to set the level of

Comparing to the debt dynamics (12) we obtain the GDP by income identity .

The government in the economy is responsible for  scal policy . Due to as-
sumption that government expenditures are  xed (g

instrument is lump-sum taxes. It is expressed by T aylor rule. This rule de nes

where r is the target real interest rate, f

is a T aylor coe cient. Supposing
target level of in ation equals zero (   = 0), active monetary policy means real
interest rate rises in the current rate of in ation

2.5 Fiscal and monetary policies’ regimes
T able 1 summarizes conditions that determine passive and active policies’ regimes.
They follow the logic presented in [32].

Economically speaking, active monetary policy regime tolerates in ation in-
crease in case of positive deviation of in ation from its target level. Consequently ,
passive monetary policy regime sustains in ation rising in case of positive devia-
tion from the target level.
F or  scal policy regimes the logic is the opposite. The regime of  scal policy
is called passive when the government stabilizes debt by generating su cient
tax revenues. Active  scal policy means that the government disregards budget
constraint and allows debt rising without collecting more taxes in order to  nance
increasing debt.

3 Equilibrium dynamics
In this Section, we analyze system (31) from the side of local equilibrium determi-
nacy and indeterminacy , including global indeterminacy , with respect to di erent
monetary and  scal policies regimes.
3.1 Steady states
System (31) possesses several steady states depend on v alues of model parameters.
First of all, we focus on the plausible steady state levels of consumption, bonds
and in ation as follows:
C
ss
= 1; b
ss
=
  g
r
;  
ss
= 0: (32)
However, if the government were to pay a gross subsidy di erent than R =
"
" 1
,
then the steady state v alue of consumption would depend on both " and R.
3.2 Analysis of local equilibrium determinacy and indeterminacy
According to [11], local equilibrium determinacy is ensured in case the number of
Jacobian matrix eigenv alues with positive real parts equals the number of  jump 
v ariables. System (31) has two  jump  v ariables, consumption and in ation, and
one  non-jump  v ariable, bonds. In economics  jumping  behaviour of v ariables
indicates that these v ariables could be set at the time of the unanticipated shock
in order to bring the economy back on the stable path. Consumption and in ation
in system (31) are such v ariables. However, government bonds are predetermined
and they cannot be changed signi cantly once unanticipated shock occurs.
F ollowing [5, 30, 50], we investigate the conditions for system (31) local equi-
librium determinacy with respect to di erent policies regimes.

by the coe cients of char-
acteristic polynomial (34): p

and p

. In case monetary and  scal policies are
active (f
M
> 0;f
F
<r) the condition detJ
ss
0
> 0 (orp
ss
3
< 0) holds. That means
active monetary and  scal policies can never imply one negative and two posi-
tive eigenv alues of Jacobian matrix (33) and, therefore, ensure local equilibrium
determinacy .
When monetary policy is now passive but  scal policy at steady state
(C
ss
;b
ss
; 
ss
) is still active (f
M
< 0;f
F
< r), detJ
ss
0
< 0 only if f
M
< q .
Knowing that active  scal policy implies TrJ
ss
0
> 0, local equilibrium determi-
nacy is achieved while monetary policy is  more passive  ( f
M
< q ).
Let monetary and  scal policies are passive ( f
M
< 0;f
F
> r). If f
F
2
(r;r +l), then all conditions are satis ed ( detJ
ss
0
< 0 and TrJ
ss
0
> 0), imply-
ing one negative and two positive roots. That means local dynamics are always
determinate. When f
F
2 (r +l; 2r +l) for obtaining detJ
ss
0
< 0 it is necessary
f
M
> q . In other words, dynamics are locally determinate only if monetary
policy is not  very passive . Moreover, it is known that dynamics are locally in-
determinate of degree 1 if Jacobian matrix J
ss
o
of (33) has two negative and one
positive roots that can be investigated if detJ
ss
0
> 0 and TrJ
ss
0
< 0. If f
M
< q
andf
F
> 2r +l, thendetJ
ss
0
> 0 andTrJ
ss
0
< 0 are satis ed and there exist two
negative and one positive roots, and local indeterminacy of degree 1.
Assume monetary policy is now active but  scal policy is still passive ( f
M
>
0;f
F
> r). If f
F
2 (r +l; 2r +l) all conditions are satis ed ( detJ
ss
0
< 0 and
TrJ
ss
0
> 0), implying one negative and two positive roots. That means local
dynamics are always determinate. When f
F
2 (r;r +l) for obtaining detJ
ss
0
< 0
it is necessary f
M
<jqj. In other words, dynamics are locally determinate only
if monetary policy is not  very active .
In special case when both the determinant detJ
ss
0
> 0 and trace TrJ
ss
0
> 0
of Jacobian matrix (33) are positive (i.e. p
ss
1
< 0 and p
ss
3
< 0) there are three
positive roots of (34) ( + + +  ). This case must therefore be associated with
a stable manifold of dimension zero (an unstable steady state) and existence of
explosive solution. T ra jectories that diverge from the steady state may converge
Electronic Journal. h ttp://di journal.spbu.ru/ 102Di er ential Equations and Contr ol Pr o c esses, N. 4, 2020
to a limit cycle or a more complicated attracting set, or diverge to in nity . This
means that local analysis of the properties of the Jacobian matrix ev aluated at
the steady state cannot be used to determine the eventual fate of the tra jectories,
i.e. using linear approximation of system (31). Under those circumstances, we
might obtain global indeterminacy , if an attracting set appears, for the following
v alues of policy parameters: f
F
< 2r +l and f
M
> g .
3.3 Conditions for equilibrium determinacy in Ricardian economy
(  = 0)
One of the key features of the presented model is possibility to consider system
(31) in the limit of in nitely lived consumers (assuming economy with Ricardian
consumers). This is achieved by supposing   = 0. In this way , consumption
dynamics are not in uenced by government debt due to the fact government bonds
are not considered as net wealth. Moreover, government bond dynamics do not
a ect in ation dynamics. Supposing economy with in nitely lived consumers, we
provide analysis of local equilibrium determinacy with respect to di erent policies
regimes as well.
Jacobian matrix (33) of model (31) with Ricardian consumers ev aluated at
the steady state point (C

of the roots we can de ne the sign of the real parts of the roots.

F urther, as postulated in [30] in Ricardian economy steady state is charac-
terized by modi ed golden rule that implies r =  . As a result, the relations
between coe cients of characteristic polynomial (38) and determinate and trace
of submatrix of Jacobian matrix (36) are following:

Similar to system with non-Ricardian consumers the equilibrium can be locally
determinate only if the number of positive real parts of eigenv alues equals the
number of  jump  v ariables. After analyzing conditions with respect to di erent
policies regimes we formulate the following Proposition.
Proposition 2 (Monetary and  sc al dynamics in c ase Ric ar dian c onsumers:

Then, dynamics ar e lo c al ly indeterminate of de gr e e 1 .

Then, dynamics ar e never lo c al ly determinate.

is now active (f

of the root

is positive. Hence, dynamics are never locally determinate because
the Jacobian matrix

the sign of the root

If  scal policy is passive the sign of the root

is negative then Jacobian matrix

has two negative roots and one positive root. Therefore, dynamics are locally
indeterminate of degree 1.

Consequently , assuming nonzero probability of death leads to consider a debt
as a net asset by consumers. This a ects their behavior and creates an additional
channel for  scal and monetary policy interaction, resulting in changing conditions
for local equilibrium determinacy as well.
3.4 Calibration and graphical analysis
W e calibrate the economy as follows. Let the time be a year. F ollowing [38, 40, 41,
48] the quarterly discount factor   in discrete time models is set at 0:99. Knowing
that  = 1   , we  nd out   = 0:01 per quarter and  = 0:04 per year. Assuming
non-Ricardian consumers are more impatient than Ricardian consumers or r> 
as in [30], we set target level of real interest rate at 0:0401. The chosen v alue of
real interest rate is close to real interest rate postulated in [5, 6, 41].
In [41] the probability of surviv al is set at 0:995 to match an average life
expectancy of 50 years. It consistent with the average age of the population in
developed countries. Thereby , we set the v alue of death probability   is equal to
0.005.
The parameter of monopoly power " should be set at v alue more than 1 in
case of re ecting the economy with monopolistic competition. Moreover, assuming
"!1, markup of price over marginal cost tends to unity ,
"
" 1
! 1 and re ecting
economy in absence of monopoly power. In the literature (see, e.g. [38, 40, 41, 51]),
the v alue " v aries from 6 to 21. W e set the following parameter at 10 that makes
markup of price over marginal cost be equal around 1:11.
F ollowing [24], we choose the v alue of Rotemberg adjustment costs. It is shown
in [24] that New Keynesian Phillips curves derived by using Rotemberg and Calvo
price setting approaches have the same structure. Moreover, the authors provide
results that the realistic v alue of Rotemberg’s price adjustment costs depends on
the steady state markup of price over marginal cost (
"
" 1
in our case) and the
probability of  rms’ price optimization that have to be chosen while considering
Calvo price-setting mechanism. It is demonstrated in the paper that for steady
state markup equals to 1:1 the range of Rotemberg’s adjustment costs v aries from
around 4 to 192, depending on the percent of reoptimizing  rms. W e have chosen
the v alue   = 100 that indicates Rotemberg adjustment costs consistent with
approximately 25% of reoptimizing  rms.
Assuming C

Figures 1 and 2 prove Proposition 1 in accordance with chosen v alues of pa-
rameters of system (31). Areas shaded gray in Figure 1 correspond to areas where
the necessary condition for local equilibrium determinacy is satis ed ( detJ

< 0).
Combining them with gray area in Figure 2 we obtain su cient condition for local
determinacy (detJ

< 0 and TrJ
ss

area in 2 intercepts all panels in 1 that allows make conclusion about local deter-
minacy by analyzing only panels in the Figure 1. F or example, in Figure 1(a) it
is shown that in case passive monetary policy (f
M
< 0) and active  scal policy
(assuming f
F
= 0:2) local equilibrium determinacy is ensured if f
M
< q or
f
M
< 0:0000297. That corresponds to point (4) of Proposition 1. Figure 1(b)
demonstrates that if both policies are passive and f
F
2 (r;r +l) (supposing
f
F
= 0:04018), then dynamics are always determinate. That corresponds to
point (2) of Proposition 1. Figure 1(c) illustrates that if monetary policy is active
and  scal policy is passive and f
F
2 (r +l; 2r +l) (for instance, f
F
= 0:0405)
dynamics are always determinate. That corresponds to point (3) of Proposition 1.

globally indeterminate behavior   a stable limit cycle. Along this cycle, all v ari-

linear ones, non-linear business cycle models can generate sustained ocsilations
even in the absence of exogenous shocks (for instance, via limit cycles or chaos).

4 F uture challenges
The study of business cycles via NK models is a vibrant area of macroeconomic
research that faces many open challenges. NK models can exhibit undesired
irregular and cyclical dynamics at plausible settings of parameters policy that
leads to implications, ranging from long-term unpredictability to global indetermi-
nacy . The existence of attracting cycles represents a severe case of policy-induced
macroeconomic instability . The occurrence of global indeterminacy is consistent
with the fact that economists who provide short term forecasts are rarely willing
to provide long term forecasts [3]. Nevertheless, discovering and tracking stable,
unstable, deterministic chaotic and stochastic processes which might observe in
models, allows to control and forecast their dynamics [1, 2, 4, 20, 26]. An important
task in both qualitative and quantitative investigation of dynamical systems is the
study of limiting behavior of a system after a transient process, i.e., the problem of
revealing and analysis of all possible limiting oscillations caused by local bifurca-
tions in the vicinity of the stationary set (trivial boundary of the global stability)
or nonlocal bifurcations (hidden boundary of the global stability), when violating
the global stability boundary in the space of parameters. In the latter case hid-
den attractor can be born [28, 33]. Are business cycle  uctuations a response to a
persistent exogenous shocks or do they re ect of a strong endogenous mechanism
which produces recurrent boom-bust phenomena? Combining of analytical and
numerical methods of mathematical control theory and macroeconomic analysis
by examing the notion of stochastic limit cycles can clarify this matter during the
next few years.
5 Conclusion
This paper derives the continuous time New Keynesian model and provides analy-
sis of monetary and  scal policies’ interactions impact on local equilibrium deter-
minacy . The model is constructed by applying structure of the economy presented
in [30]. There are four main agents in the economy , namely representative con-
sumer, representative producer, the government and Central bank. In contrast
to [30], we incorporate Rotemberg price-setting mechanism instead of Calvo. De-
parting from Ricardian equiv alence, we consider representative consumer faces
constant probability of death. The model is constructed as a system of three dif-
ferential equations presenting dynamics of consumption, government bonds and
in ation. The system incorporates 10 parameters, including f
F
and f
M
that

indicate T aylor coe cients of  scal and monetary policies’ rules respectively .
The main  ndings of the paper are formulated in Proposition 1. Our anal-
ysis proves the following results. First, local equilibrium determinacy cannot be
ensured in case of active monetary and  scal policies. In other words, if  scal
authority does not increase taxes collection in response to increasing government
debt, but monetary policy rule is aimed at stabilizing in ation, then the unique-
ness of the equilibrium solution is never achieved. Second, local equilibrium de-
terminacy in any other policies’ combinations depends on ranges of f
F
and f
M
.
Local equilibrium determinacy can be achieved only through appropriate choos-
ing v alues of these parameters. Finding appropriate v alues for f
M
depends on a
critical v alue q that is de ned by system’s parameters and the T aylor coe cient
f
F
. Moreover, the main results are compared with those that are derived for the
case of Ricardian consumers (  = 0). It is shown that government debt is a net
asset, there appears an additional channel for  scal and monetary policy inter-
action which changes conditions for local equilibrium determinacy . In addition
to determinate and indeterminate equlibria, a larger set of equilibria including
those in which endogenous v ariables remain bounded but are never expected to
return to the steady state, such as limit cycles, might appear, leading to global
indeterminacy .
