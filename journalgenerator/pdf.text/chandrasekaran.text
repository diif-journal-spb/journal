                  ABSTRACT: In this work,  we use the theory of resolvent operators, the fractional powers of operators,  
                 fixed point technique and the Gelfand- Shilov principle to establish the existence and uniqueness of  
                 local  mild and then classical solutions of a class of nonlinear fractional evolution integro-differential  
                 equations with nonlocal conditions in  Banach space.  
 
Keywords : Fractional parabolic equation, fractional powers, mild and classical solutions, localexistence, resolvent

1. Introduction 
The aim of this paper is to study the nonlocal fractional Cauchy problem of the form

in a Banach space  , where            
 
    Let J denote the closure of the interval 
[ 
 
  )   
 
       We assume that – ( ) is a closed linear operator defined on a dense domain  
 ( ) in   into   such that  ( )   is independent of  . It is assumed also that  – ( ) generates an 
evolution operator in the  Banach space     the function   is real valued and locally integrable on

              Recently, fractional differential equations have attracted many authors [8, 12, 14-18, 20, 22, 
25]. This is mostly because it efficiently describes many phenomena arising in engineering, physics, 
economy and science. In fact it can find several applications in viscoelasticity, electrochemistry, 
electromagnetic, and so on. The existence of solutions to evolution equations with nonlocal conditions 
in Banach space was studied first by Byszewski [9]. Subsequently many authors extended the work to 
various kinds of nonlinear evolution equations [17, 18, 22, 25]. Deng [13] indicated that using the 
nonlocal condition  ( 
 
)  ( )

amount of gas in a transparent tube, can give better results than using the usual local Cauchy problem 
 ( 
 
)  
 
 Also for several works (first order differential equations with initial conditions) concerned 
with this kind of research, we refer to [3-7, 11, 21, 29]. 
     The results obtained in this paper are generalizations of the results given by Debbouche [11] 
Bahuguna [2],  El-Borai[17,18],  Pazy [26]  and Yan [28]. 
     Our work is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the review of some essential results in 
fractional calculus and also to the resolvent operators and the fractional powers of operators which will 
be used in this work to obtain our main results. In section 3, we establish the existence of a unique 
local mild solution of (1.1), (1.2). In Section 4, We study the regularity of the mild solution of the 
considered problem and show under the additional condition of Hӧlder continuity on B that this mild 
solution is in fact the classical solution.  
 
2. Preliminaries  
 
Following Gelfand and Shilov [20], we define the fractional integral of order     as 
 
 
 
 ( ) 
 
 ( )
∫ (   )
   
 
 
 ( )    
and the fractional derivative of the function   of order       as 
a
 
 
 
 ( ) 
 
 (   )
 
  
∫

 ( )   
 
 
 
where   is an abstract continuous on the interval [   ] and  ( ) is the Gamma function, see [11]. 
 
Definition 2.1 By a classical solution of (1.1), (1.2) on   , we mean a function   with values in   
such that: 
(1)   is continuous function on [ 
 
  ) and  ( )  ( )  
(2) 
 
 
 
  
 
 exists and is continuous on [ 
 
  )        and   satisfies (1.1) on ( 
 
  ) and the 
nonlocal condition (1.2). 
 
By a local classical solution of (1.1), (1.2) on J, we mean that there exist a  
 
   
 
  
 
    and a 
function   defined from  
 
 [ 
 
  
 
] into   such that   is a classical solution of (1.1), (1.2). 
 
Let   be the Banach space formed from  ( ) with the graph norm. Since – ( ) is aclosed 
operator, it follows that – ( ) is in the set of bounded operators from   to  . 
 
Definition 2.2(See[8,28]). A resolvent operator for problem (1.1), (1.2) is abounded operator- 
valued function  (   )  ( )         the space of bounded linear operators on    having the 
following properties: 
 
(i)  (   ) is strongly continuous in   and  ,  (   )         ‖ (   )‖   
 (   )
 
     for some constant   and    
 
(ii)  (   )      (   ) is strongly continuous in   and   on    
 
(iii) For      (   )  is continuously differentiable in   [   ) and  
  
  
(   )   (   ) ( )   
 
(iv)  For       [   )  (   )  is continuously differentiable in   [   ) and

(   )  and 
  
  
(   )  are strongly continuous on          
Here  (   ) can be extracted from the evolution operator of the generator – ( )  The resolvent 
operator is similar to the evolution operator for nonautonomous differential equations in a Banach 
space. 
 
Definition 2.3 (See[8, 22, 25]).  A continuous function        is said to be a mild solution of 
problem (1.1), (1.2) if for all  
 
    it satisfies the integral equation

                                    ∫ (   ) (   ( ))  ]

By a local mild solution of (1.1), (1.2) on    we mean that there exist a  
 
  
 
  
 
    and a function 
  defined from  
 
 [ 
 
  
 
] into   such that   is a mild solution of  (1.1),(1.2). 
 
       We define the fractional power

is invertible, and

3. Local Mild Solutions  
To establish local existence of the considered problem, we assume that –  is invertible and  
 
   
    see [19, 23, 24, 27]. According to [26, Section 2.6], we can deduce the following. Differential Equations and Control Processes, № 2, 2014

In this Section, We establish the regularity of the mild solutions of (1.1), (1.2).  Let   denote the 
closure of the interval [

       In addition to the hypotheses mentioned in the earlier 
sections, we assume on the kernel  , that

Theorem 4.1.  Suppose that   ( ) generates the resolvent operator  (   ) such that  
‖ (   )‖   
 (   )
 and     [  ( ) ]. Further, suppose that the maps      
 
  and   satisfy (F), 
(G) and (H)  and the kernel   satisfies (I). Then (1.1), (1.2) has aunique local classical solution for 
 
 
  
 
  
 
Proof: From Theorem 3.2, it follows that there exist  
 
   
 
  
 
   and a function   such that   is a 
unique mild solution of (1.1), (1.2) on solution  
 
 [ 
 
  ) given by (3.9). Let  ( )  
 
 ( )  Then

                                                                                                      (   ) 
where  
̃
( )  (   
  
 ( ) ∫ (    
 
  
 
  
 ( ))   ∫ 
 
(

 ̃( )  (   
  
 ( ))  Since  ( ) is continuous on  
 
 and the maps  ,    
 
 and   satisfy (F) , (G) 
and (H), it follows that  
̃
 and  ̃ are continuous, and therefore bounded on  
 
  Let  
 
 
    
   
 
‖ 
̃
( )‖ 
and 
  
 
    
   
 
‖ ̃( )‖   
(4.2) 
By using the same method as in [13, Theorem 3.2], we can prove that  ( ) is locally H lder 
continuous on  
 
  Then there exist a constant C such that for every  
 
 
  
 
  we have  
                                                        ‖ ( 
 
)  ( 
 
)‖  |

                                                 (4.3) 
for all  
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
   
 
Now, assumption (F), (G) and (H)  with (4.3) implies that there exist constants  
 
  
 
   and 
         such that for all  
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
  we have  
 
‖ 
̃
( 
 
)  
̃
(

|
 
  
 
‖ ̃( 
 
)  ̃( 
 
)‖  
 
| 
 
  
 
|
 
  
Which shows that  
̃
 and  ̃ are locally H lder continuous on  
 
  Let  
 ( )  
̃
( ) ∫ (   ) ̃( )  
 
 
 
  
It is clear that  ( ) is locally H lder continuous on  
 
  For  
 
  
 
  we have

For some constants  
 
   and        Consider the Cauchy problem  
                                                  
 
 
 ( )
  
 
  ( ) ( )  ( )    
 
                                                      (   ) 
                                                              (

  ( )                                                                       (   ) 
From Pazy [25], the problem (4.4), (4.5) has a unique solution   on  
 
 into   given by  
                             ( )  (

 ( )
∫

for    
 
  Each term on the right-hand side belongs to  ( )   hence belongs to  ( 
 
)  
 
Applying  
 
 on both sides of (4.6) and using the uniqueness of  ( ) , we have that  
 
 ( ) 
 ( )  It follows that   is the classical solution of (1.1),(1.2) on  
 
  Thus   is the unique local classical 
solution of (1.1),(1.2) on                                                                                                                          □
