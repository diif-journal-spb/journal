Abstract. We take a space X of dynamical systems that could be: homeomorphisms or continuous
maps of a compact metric spaceK or diffeomorphisms of a smooth manifold or actions of an amenable
group. We demonstrate that a typical dynamical system of X is a continuity point for the set of
probability invariant measures considered as a function of a map, letY be the set of all such continuity
points. As a corollary we prove that for dynamical systems of the residual set Y average values of
continuous functions calculated along trajectories do not drastically change if the system is perturbed.
Keywords: topological dynamics, invariant measures, ergodic theory, stability, shadowing, tolerance
stability.

1 Introduction.
We consider the problem of structural stability of general dynamical systems
that can be continuous maps/homeomorphisms of a metric compact space, dif-
feomorphisms of a smooth manifold or actions of a  nitely generated group.Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2017
We are interested in questions related to structural stability of such systems.
For example, could we say that a generic dynamical system is structurally sta-
ble in a sense? If structural stability means topological conjugacy with close
maps, then for C
1
diffeomorphisms of a smooth manifold, the answer is "no"
[1]. However, individual stability of all periodic points is generic since Kupka {
Smale diffeomorphisms are generic [2].
An approach to study structural stability is given by the so-called Shadow-
ing Theory [3] . Here both shadowing and inverse shadowing [4], [5] phenomena
are important. Shadowing implies existence of exact trajectories in neighbour-
hoods of approximate ones and the inverse shadowing implies existence of tra-
jectories of a  xed method in neighbourhoods of solutions. Observe that shad-
owing and inverse shadowing do not imply existence of a periodic solution in a
neighbourhood of a periodic pseudotrajectory. However, sometimes, shadowing
implies robustness of periodic solutions. Sakai [6] demonstrated that the C
1
-
interior of the set of all diffeomorphisms with shadowing coincides with the set
of all structurally stable diffeomorphisms. Osipov, Pilyugin and Tikhomirov
[7] demonstrated that the so-called Lipschitz periodic shadowing property is
equivalent to 
 { stability, see also [8]. Moreover, the corresponding set of dy-
namical systems coincides with the interior of the set of systems with periodic
shadowing property and with the set of systems with orbital limit shadowing
property. Pilyugin and Tikhomirov [9] demonstrated that Lipschitz shadowing
is equivalent to structural stability. In all quoted cases periodic solutions are
preserved. It was proved that shadowing is generic in the space of homeomor-
phisms of compact manifolds [10]. However, it is not generic in the space ofC
1
- diffeomorphisms [11] see also [12] for C
r
- case.
F. Takens (see [13], [14], [15] and references therein) offered another ap-
proach, called tolerance stability. He proved that for a generic homeomorphism
(or diffeomorphism) any trajectory of a perturbed map belongs to a neighbour-
hood of a trajectory of the non-perturbed one. We give precise formulation of
corresponding theorems in Section 4.
The aim of this paper is the following. It is proved that for a generic
dynamical system all points are orbit-wise weakly structurally stable. This
means that for any trajectory of the initial system there is a trajectory of
the perturbed system that lies in a neighbourhood of the initial trajectory.
Moreover, for an a priori selected observable, we can say that its average value
along the given trajectory does not drastically change if the system is slightly
perturbed. In a sense, the weak shadowing, we obtain, is close to statistical
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 134Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2017
shadowing, introduced by M. Blank [16], see also [17].
To prove this result methods of Ergodic Theory are applied. Also, the
approach developed by author in [18] is used. First of all, we consider sets of
Borel probability invariant measures and prove that a generic dynamical system
is a "point of continuity" for such sets.
Since this is true for measures, associated with trajectories, there must be a
solution that engenders an invariant measure, close to initial one. This implies
that there is a point such that its perturbed trajectory is close to the non-
perturbed one "in average". This approach is very close to the Takens' theory.
We discuss and compare results in Section 4.
2 Stability of the set of invariant measures
Let (K; ) be a compact metric set, consider the space of all continuous maps
X := C
0
(K ! K). Let dist
X
be the standard metrics in X. LetM(K)
be the set of all Borel probability measures on K endowed with the topology
of  { weak convergence. This topology can be engendered by the so called
Kantorovich - Rubinstein distance. Let us recall one of equivalent de nitions
of this metrics
W

( ; ) = sup
 Z
K
fd  
Z
K
fd 
 
;
where the supremum is taken over the all 1 - Lipschitz continuous functions
f : K! R. Observe that the setM(K) becomes compact in that metrics.
Later on, we use the same notionW
1
( ; ) for distance between a compact subset
P M(K) and a point q2M(K). This distance turns to zero if and only if
q2P .
Recall the notion of Hausdorff metrics. Let given the space K consider
compact subsets P;Q M(K;T ). Then we can de ne
d
H
(P;Q) = max
p2P
W
1
(p;Q) + max
q2Q
W
1
(q;P):
This distance turns to zero if and only if sets P and Q coincide.
For all metric spaces we deal with in this paper, we introduce following
notions: B
"
(x) stands for the " - ball centered at x and U
"
(A) stands for " -
neighbourhood of a compact subset A.
Given a map T 2 X introduce the setM(K;T ) of all Borel probability
measures, invariant with respect to T . This set is also compact in the metrics

and non-empty by Krylov { Bogolyubov Theorem.
Consider the mapM : T!M(K;T ) that is a map from X to the set Z
of all compact subsets ofM(K) endowed with the Hausdorff metrics d
H
.
De nition 2.1. We say that the mapM is upper semicontinuous at the point
T
0
if for any " > 0 there exists a   > 0 such that dist
X
(T
0
;T
1
) <   implies
M(K;T
1
) U
"
(M(K;T
0
)).
Here we order subsets of K by inclusion. As usually, "upper semicontinu-
ity" means that that the value of the function cannot drastically increase in a
neighbourhood of the point.
Recall that a setY X is called residual if it is a countable intersection of
open dense subsets of X.
The main objective of this section is the following statement.
Theorem 2.2. For any compact metric space K there exists a residual subset
Y X such that any T2Y is a continuity point for the map M.
We start with the following statement that is almost evident.
Lemma 2.3. The mapM is upper semicontinuous.
Proof. Fix a map T 2 X. Consider a sequence of maps T
k
: X ! X,
converging toT . Let 
k
be the sequence of Borel probability measures, invariant
with respect to T
k
. Suppose that the sequence  
k
  { wealky converges to  .
Check that   is invariant with respect to T that is

tends to zero. Since the sequence

in that right-hand side converges to

K
' Td . This proves equality (1).  
To  nish the proof of Theorem 2.2 it su ces to apply the following result
 rst given in [13], see also [19, Corollary 11.1]. We provide this statement here
reformulating it in our terms.

Lemma 2.4 (Takens). Let X be a metric space,M : X! Z be an upper
semicontinuous (or lower semicontinuous) map of X to Z that is a set of all
closed subset of a compact metric space. Then there is a residual set Y   X
such that any point of Y is a point of continuity for the mapM.
Together with Lemma 2.3, the last statement  nishes the proof of Theorem
2.2.
Remark 2.5. Instead of C
0
(K ! K) we may consider any subspace X of
that space with a topology that is not coarser than the topology induced by the
metric of C
0
(this means that convergence in the topology considered implies
convergence in the standard topology ofC
0
(K)). For instance, we may consider
the space of homeomorphisms of a compact metric space K. Or, we can take a
C
r
smooth manifoldK (r  1) and consider a set ofC
r
smooth diffeomorphisms
of K (later on, whenever speaking of smooth maps with r> 0, we assume that
K is a compact manifold). A statement, similar to Theorem 2.2, is still valid
in the considered case.
We can also expand the obtained result to actions of  nitely generated
groups. For any group G, we consider C
r
actions (r  0) of that group that is
the set of all homomorphisms h : G! Diff
r
(K) of G to the set of C
r
smooth
diffeomorphisms of K. If the group G is amenable, the Krylov-Bogolyubov
theorem is still applicable [20] and the set of Borel invariant measures is non-
empty.
Fixing  =fg

where d

in the right hand side of Eq. (3) stands for C

Corollary 2.6. Let r2 N

C
r
{ smooth Riemannian manifold if r > 0. Let G be an amenable  nitely
generated group and X be the set of all C
r
actions of G with the metrics d
G
given by Eq. (3). Consider the set Z of all compact subsets in the set of
all Borel probability measures on K with the Hausdorff metrics engendered by
Kantorovich - Rubinstein distance between measures. Given an action h2 X,
considerM(h) that is the set of all Borel probability h { invariant measures.
Then there exists a residual subset Y X such that any h2Y is a continuity
point for the map M.

One can get a result similar to Corollary 2.5, for actions of a  nitely gen-
erated non-amenable groups (for instance, free groups). Then, we have to take
the spaceX of all actions that have a Borel probability invariant measure (e.g.
actions of free groups that have a  nite orbit).

Let r2N

r> 0. Let X be the set of all C
r
{ diffeomorphisms of K (homeomorphisms if
r = 0). Fix the set Y that exists by Theorem 2.2 or by Corollary 2.5. Given
a point p2K and a map T2C

Let us list some versions of Theorem 3.1. The next one concerns actions

The proof is similar to proof of Theorem 3.1 with the only difference: we
use one-side Birkhof Ergodic Theorem [21, Theorem 4.1.2].
Basing on Corollary 2.6, we could prove a similar result for actions of  nitely
generated amenable groups. Such actions could be treated as actions of  nitely
generated free groups where the existence of Borel probability invariant mea-
sures is guaranteed. The Birkhoff's theorem for actions of free groups was
provided by Stein and Nevo [22].
In the rest of this section we always deal with homeomorphisms of compact
metric spaces having in mind all possible generalisations.
For Lipschitz continuous functions ', we have the following "uniform" ver-
sion of Theorem 3.1:

4 Takens' theory.
In this section we compare our results with closely related statements of Takens'
Theory [13], [14], [15], [19] (see also references therein) and compare them with
the result of our paper.
De nition 4.1. Let (K; ) be a compact metric space, H(K) be the set of all
homeomorphisms of K. Fix "> 0. We say that two homeomorphisms S and T
are orbitally " { equivalent if the following conditions are satis ed:
1. For any trajectoryO
S
(p) of the homeomorphismS there exists a trajectory
O
T
(q) of the homeomorphism T such that
1.1. O
S
(p) U
"
(O
T
(q)),
1.2. O
T
(q) U
"
(O
S
(p));
2. for any trajectory O
T
(q) of the homeomorphism T there exists a trajectory
O
S
(p) of the homeomorphism S such that
2.1. O
T
(q) U
"
(O
S
(p)),
2.2. O
S
(p) U
"
(O
T
(q)).
De nition 4.2. Let D  H(M) be a subset with the inherited topology. We
say that a homeomorphism T2D is tolerance D { stable if for any "> 0 there
exists a neighbourhood V of T in D such that any diffeomorphism S2V is " {
equivalent to T .
F. Takens [13] formulated the following conjecture.
Conjecture 4.3. (Zeeman's tolerance stability conjecture). For any D  
H(M) there exists a residual (in the topology of D) subset D
0
  D such that
any homeomorphism T2D
0
is tolerance D { stable.
In this form the statement is wrong, a counterexample was provided by W.
White in [14] (see also [24]) proved that generally, speaking, tolerance stability
conjecture is wrong. However, Takens proved a weaker version of the conjecture.

are minimally " { equivalent (maximally " { equivalent) if conditions 1.1 and
2.1 of De nition 4.1 (respectively, conditions 1.2 and 2.2) are omitted in the
above de nition of orbital " { equivalence.
Denote by D
max
the subset of D which consists of homeomorphisms T
having the following property: For any " > 0 there exists a neighbourhood V
ofT inD such that any homeomorphismS2V is maximally" { equivalent to
f (recall that we consider the set D with a topology that is not coarser than
the standard C
0
topology).
Similarly, we denote by D
min
the subset of D which consists of homeomor-
phisms f having the following property: For any " > 0 there exists a neigh-
bourhood V of T in D such that any homeomorphism S2W is minimally " -
equivalent to T . Takens proved the following statement.
Theorem 4.4 (Takens) Any of the sets D
max
and D
min
is residual in D.
A. Mazur [15] demonstrated that for the complete space of homeomorphisms
of a compact manifold Conjecture 4.3 is valid in a stronger form. Before for-
mulating the statement we give one more de nition.
De nition 4.5. A homeomorphism T2 H(M) is strongly tolerance stable if
for every "> 0 there exists  > 0 such that for every S2B
 
(T ) eachS { orbit
is " { traced (see De nition 3.6) by some T { orbit and each S {orbit is " {
traced by some T { orbit.
Theorem 4.6 (Mazur). LetK be a compact smooth manifold with the metric
d induced by the Riemanian structure. A generic f 2 H(K) has the strong
tolerance stability property.
For periodic points we can say a bit more.
De nition 4.7. Let " > 0, S be a homeomorphism of a metric compact set
(K; ). We say that a sequencefx
i
:i2Ng is " { traced by a trajectory O
S
(p)
if for any i we have  (x
i
;S
i
(p))<".
Theorem 4.8. Let X be a subset of H(K) { the space of all homeomorphisms
of K with the topology not coarser than one, inherited from H(K). Suppose
that any homeomorphismT X has a  xed point (or a point with a period less
or equal than a given number n
0
). Then there exists a residual set Y such that
for anyT2Y , any"> 0 and anyn2N (n n
0
) there exists a neighbourhood
V
n
of T in X such that for any S2 V
n
and any m
p
{ periodic point p of T
(m  n) there is a periodic point q2 K with a period m
q
  n such that the
orbit O
T
(p) is " { traced by O
S
(q).
To prove this statement, it su ces to consider a map of the set X to the
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 144Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2017
set of all point with period n. This map is upper semicontinuous so we could
apply Takens' result (Lemma 2.4) similarly to the proof of Theorem 2.2.
Observe that, for instance typical diffeomorphism of a smooth manifold has
periodic points, as it was proved by Bonatti and Crovisier [23]. Moreover, they
demonstrated that for a typical diffeomorphism the set of periodic points is
dense in the set of all chain recurrent points.
Let us compare results of Theorems 4.4 and 4.6 with Theorems 3.1 { 3.5.
Theorem 4.4 works for a very wide class of dynamical systems and, unlike our
formula (6), it claims that the whole set of one trajectory (not the majority of
points) belongs to a neighbourhood of another one. However, only closeness of
sets is provided and no "statistical" or "Cesaro average" properties like (7) can
be provided or derived strictly from the statement of Takens' theorem.
For homeomorphisms of manifolds, Mazur's statement (one of Theorem 4.6)
is much stronger than ones of our results. Pointwise " { tracing is much more
than all statistical properties, we are studying. However, the proof, provided
in [15] and, more generally, ideas of the paper [10], crucially depend on the
manifold structure of the considered set. Moreover, the proof uses the fact that
the complete set of homeomorphisms is considered, not a subset. For instance,
it cannot be easily transformed to a statement onC
r
{ diffeomorphisms (r  1).
We believe that our result stands in the middle between Takens' and Mazur's
ones and thus completes the Takens' tolerance stability theory.
