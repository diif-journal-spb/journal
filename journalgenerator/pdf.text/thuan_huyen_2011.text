Abstract
This paper presents new exponentially stabilization conditions for a class of linear
systems with time-varying delays in state and control. The time-delays function is as-
sumed to be continuously belonging to a given interval in which the lower bound of delay
is not restricted to zero. New delay-dependent, based on the constructing of improved
Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals combined with Leibniz-Newton’s formula, suﬃcientcon-
ditions for the exponential stabilization via memoryless control are established in terms
of LMIs. That allows us to compute simultaneously the two bounds that characterize
exponential stability of the solution. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate that
the derived conditions are much less conservative than those given in the literature.
Keywords: Interval nondifferentiable time-varying delay, Exponentially stabilization,
Linear matrix inequalities.

1 Introduction

of the closed-loop systems. Therefor, the problem of stabilization of control
system with input delays has been received considerable attention from many
researchers [4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11]. By using an improved state transformation,
Chen and Zheng [3], Yue [19], Yue and Han [20] derived suﬃcent conditions for
the robust stabilization of linear uncertain systems with unknown input delay
in terms of LMI’s but the system is required to be global controllable. In [8]
Hien by using an improved Lyapunov-Krasovskiifunctional, a delay-dependent
conditions for exponential stabilization are derived in terms of LMI. The con-
ditions do not require any assumption about the controllability of the nominal
system. However, the stabilization condition reported in this work require the
delay functions to be constans.
Ontheotherhand,thestabilizationofdynamicsystemwithintervaltime-
varying delays has been a focused topic of theoreticaland practicalimportance
[2, 14, 15, 17, 18] in very recent years. Interval time-varying delay is a time
delay that varies in an interval which the lower bound is not restricted to be
0. Delay-dependent robust exponential stabilization criteria for interval time-
varyingdelaysystemswithnorm-boundeduncertaintiesareproposedin[17],by
usingLyapunov-Krasovskiifunctionalscombinedwiththefree-weightingmatri-
cesbutthetime-varyingdelaysarerequiredtobedifferentiable. Itisnotedthat
theformerhasmorematrixvariablesthanoursesult,butoursesulthaslesscon-
servativeandmatrixvariablesthan[17]. Recent,in[2]T.Botmart,P.Niamsup
and V. N. Phat, based on the constructing of improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii
functionalscombinedwithLeibniz-Newton’sformulaandthetechniqueofdeal-
ing with some integral terms, a delay-dependent suﬃcient conditions for the
exponential stabilization via memoryless control are established in terms of
LMIs withoutintroducinganyfree-weightingmatrices. However,in the results,
the interval time-varying delayed control input was not considered there. In
addition, the approach used in paper [2] can not be applied to the system is
studied by us.
In this paper, the problem of exponential stabilization for a class of lin-
ear systems with interval time-varying delays in state and control is studied.
The time delays is a continuous functions belonging to a given interval, which
means that the lower and upper bounds for the time-varying delay are avail-
able, but the delay function is not necessary to be differentiable. Based on
the constructing of improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals combined with

A−B > 0. The symmetric term in a matrix is denoted by ∗.
Consider a linear control system with interval time-varying delays in state
and control of the form
˙ x(t) =Ax(t)+Dx(t−h(t))+Bu(t)+B

u(t−d(t)),
x(t) =φ(t),t∈ [−h,0],h={h

where the time-varying delays functions h(t),d(t) satisﬁes

It is worth noting that the time delays are assumed to be a continuous
function belonging to a given interval, which means that the lower and up-
per bounds for the time-varying delay are available, but the delay function is
bounded but not restricted to being zero.

Pre- and post-multiplying both sides of Ω with

and using the memoryless feedback control
u(t)=Kx(t),K =YT

we have
Ξ = ΘΩΘ.
Note that Ω< 0 if and only if Ξ< 0. Therefor, from condition (3), we obtain

which implies the closed-loop system is α−exponential stable. This completes
the proof of the theorem.
Remark 3.1. Based on the constructing of improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii
functionalscombinedwithLeibniz-Newton’sformulaandthetechniqueofdeal-
ing with some integral terms, new delay-dependent suﬃcient conditions for the
exponential stabilization via memoryless control are established in terms of
LMIs without introducing any free-weighting matrices. In addition, the time
varying functions considered in this paper is not necessary differentiable and
interval time-varying delays in state and control. So, the proposed stabiliza-
tion criterion is independent of the derivative of time delay which can reduce
the conservatism. Moreover, our results extend the results of T. Botmart, P.
Niamsup and V. N. Phat [2].
Finally, as an application for Theorem 3.1, we give a suﬃcient condition
for exponential stability of the class system without delayed control input was
studied in [2].

It is worth noting that, the delay functions h(t),d(t) are non-differentiable.
Therefore, the mothods is used in [8, 19, 20, 21] are not applicable to this
system. We have
0.1≤h(t)≤ 0.2,0.2≤d(t)≤ 0.3.
Given α = 0.1. By using LMI toolbox of Matlab, we can verify that, the LMI

5 Conclusions
In this paper, we have investigated the exponential stabilization via memory-
less control for a class of linear systems with interval time-varying delays in
state and control. The interval time-varying delay function is not necessary
to be differentiable which allows time-delay function to be a fast time-varying
function. AnewclassofLyapunov-Krasovskiifunctionalisconstructedtoprove

the effectiveness of the theoretical results.
