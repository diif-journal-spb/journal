Abstract. The article deals with the problem of optimal measurement for a
semilinear descriptor system with a distinguished linear part and a nonlinear
term unsolved with respect to the derivative of the unknown vector function
with the Showalter{Sidorov initial condition. Basing on the methods of the
theory of optimal control we found su cient conditions for the existence of
solutions of the optimal measurement problem { the problem of recovering a
dynamically distorted signal from a measuring device. An algorithm for  nding
a numerical solution uses the methods of decomposition, penalty and the Ritz
method as well. The algorithm is based on the representation of the measure-
ment components by polynomials of a given degree, which allows reducing the
optimal control problem to a computer programming problem with respect to
the unknown coe cients of the polynomials. As an example of a sensor we
consider Fitz Hugh { Nagumo oscilloscope described by a nonlinear descrip-
tor system. Computational experiments for the considered sensor model are
presented.
Keywords: descriptor systems, optimal control problem, mathematical model

1 Introduction
In the theory of dynamic measurements, an urgent problem is the problem of
reconstructing measurements from observation. The traditional approach [1]
to solving this problem is a method based on the theory of inverse problems
[2]. Another approach [3] is a research method based on the automatic control
theory [4]. In the meantime, the [5] approach has recently appeared, based on
the theory of optimal control of solutions of linear Sobolev-type equations [6, 7,
8]. Article [5] initiated a several researches on the study of optimal measurement
problems for linear deterministic and stochastic descriptor systems, also called
Leontief-type systems [10, 11]. The problem
J(y)! min (1)
will be called the optimal measurement problem if it is based on the search for
the optimum of the target functional from the norm of the difference between
real (i.e.,  xed on a measuring device) and virtual (i.e., found by means of a
computational algorithm) observations. Based on the ideas and approaches of
the theory of optimal measurement for linear descriptor systems and extend-
ing the methods of the theory of optimal control for semilinear Sobolev-type
equations, it will be possible to investigate optimal measurement problems for
semilinear descriptor systems. This approach allows one to take into account
nonlinear connections in sensors and expand the range of studied problems.
The main goal of our research is the numerical solution of the optimal
measurement problem (1) for semilinear descriptor systems
L _ x(t) +Mx(t) +N(x(t)) =u(t); detL = 0; (2)
and
y(t) =Dx(t) (3)
with the Showalter{Sidorov initial condition
L(x(0) x
0
) = 0: (4)
A numerical study of linear problems of optimal dynamic measurement with the
development of program algorithms was carried out in the works [12, 13, 14]. In
these works, algorithms of numerical methods for solving optimal control prob-
lems for linear Sobolev-type equations were adapted to the  nite-dimensional
case. By modifying the algorithms of numerical methods developed for semilin-
ear equations of Sobolev type [15] for the case of semilinear descriptor systems,
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 116Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2020
this article will build a numerical method algorithm for the problem (1) { (3).
The method obtained will be based on the methods of decomposition, penalty
and Ritz [15].
The research of the optimal measurement problem for semilinear descriptor
systems can be divided into three stages, each of which is one of the sections of
this article. At the  rst stage, a mathematical model of the investigated sen-
sor is created, the problem of  nding the optimal measurement is set, and the
conditions are given under which there is a unique solution to this problem. At
the second stage, algorithms are constructed for approximate solutions to the
problem of  nding the optimal measurement. And  nally, at the third stage of
the optimal measurement problem research, on the basis of the algorithms of
the second stage, programs are created and computational experiments are per-
formed. In our case, we research the problem of optimal dynamic measurement
for the mathematical model of the Fitz Hugh { Nagumo oscilloscope [16, 17].

on the functions x;u; therefore, we can assume that J(y) =J(x;u).
Consider the set
M =fx2X : (I Q)(Mx +N(x)) = (I Q)ug: (6)
By virtue of the properties of the matrix L, there exists a projector Q along
coker L onto im L. Note that if x =x(t) is a solution to equation (2), then it
necessarily lies in the setM. The setM will be called the phase manifold of
equation (2).

Proof. The main ideas of the proof are based on the reduction of the problem
we are investigating to the general problem of optimal control for semilinear
Sobolev-type equations. The conceptual proof of this Theorem is similar to the
proof of Theorem 2 in [15] into account the transition to the  nite-dimensional
case.
 
The vector-function ~ u = ~ u(t) existing by Theorem 1 will, in what follows, be
called the exact optimal measurement. Note that the vector functions ~ u = ~ u(t)
and y = y(t) obtained as a result of applying Theorem 1 are virtual exact
optimal measurement and virtual exact optimal observation.
3 Algorithm for Numerical Method
Based on the theoretical results, an algorithm was developed for the approx-
imate solution of the optimal control problem (1) { (4), where the objective
functional has the form (5), based on modi ed decomposition and Ritz meth-
ods. Applying the decomposition method described in [15], we linearize system
(2), by introducing the functionv =v(t), and obtain the equivalent Showalter{
Sidorov problem (2) { (4) for the system of equations:
L _ x(t) +Mx(t) +N(v(t)) =u(t); detL = 0;
x(t) =v(t);
y(t) =Dx(t):
(9)
Then the solution (x;u) of problem (1) { (4) reduces to  nding the triple
(x;v;u): Using the Ritz method, we represent the unknown functions v(t),
u(t); by the expansion v(t;H) =

an approximate solution of the control problem (1), (4), (9) by the penalty
method described in [15]. We consider the equivalent control problem, where

The basic ideas of the algorithm were developed for the in nite-dimensional
case, based on the methods of penalty, Ritz and decomposition. In this arti-
cle, it is proposed to modify the already constructed algorithms for the  nite-

The main stages of the algorithm after the transition to the  nite-dimensional
case are presented in Fig. 1.
The program is designed to  nd a solution to the optimal measurement
problem, written in the Maple language using the Maple 2017 compiler. The
choice of the programming environment was due to the presence of a built-in
analytical computing apparatus and built-in tools for solving systems of ordi-
nary differential equations. The program is based on methods for solving opti-
mal control problems for semilinear Sobolev type equations by the Showalter{
Sidorov initial condition.
Data entry is carried out from the keyboard and is saved in a text  le that
sets the calculation parameters in the rest of the program. Also, functions and
calculation coe cients are saved in separate  les, from which the necessary data
arrays are loaded. The following data is used as input:
  the type of quality functional that will be accepted for calculation;

of initial values of the system state;
  the right boundary of the segment T on which the problem is considered.
When creating the program, methods of code optimization and calculations
were used. To simplify the writing of program code, we used such an oppor-
tunity of the Maple programming language as built-in and speci ed structures
for calculating results. Thus, the calculation formulas in the program text are
always visible to the user, which affects the understanding of the program code
and the ease of its modi cation. The program was also subjected to optimiza-
tion of the computation speed. Due to the fact that when calculating many
program procedures, the values of the function must be obtained not for an in-
 nite number of values of variables, but mainly only for the integration nodes,
then, taking into account the maximum of the double integral in the formula

of the quality functional, it is su cient to save the number of values for m

,
where m + 1 is the number integration nodes.
4 Computational Experiment
For illustration, consider the Fitz Hugh{Nagumo oscillator, a simpli ed diagram
of which is shown in Fig. 2. It represents an oscillatory RLC circuit with
a nonlinear connected to it (in the classical version is a tunnel diode), the
sum of the voltages acts on: a constant voltage supply of the circuit V
c
and
an alternating external signal  (t). The current-voltage characteristic of the
element (3) can be approximated by a cubic polynomial: I =F (U) =aU

 gU,
whereg is the negative differential conductivity, which allows \pumping energy"
in the oscillatory circuit.

The system of equations (11) was in-

is also discussed [18, 19]. The need to study cases when one of these parameters
is equal to zero is associated with the fact that the rate of change of one of the
components signi cantly exceeds the other.
It is required to  nd a solution to the problem (11), (3), (4), (8) under the
following conditions: "

The condition (15) is introduced because v(t) and x

Let us solve problem (3), (4), (13), (8) with respect to unknowns a

As a result of calculations, an approximate solution of problem (3), (4),

In the problem of optimal measurement, we are not interested in the found
~ x(t); because the primary task is to restore the signal ~ u(t) (Fig. 3), but since
we use the decomposition method due to the nonlinearity of the investigated
descriptor system, it is necessary in computational experiments to control the
su cient proximity of ~ x(t); ~ v(t); which is guaranteed by the smallness of the

this parameter can be adjusted. In our problem, for the given parameters, ~ x(t);
~ v(t) are close enough (Fig. 4), moreover, since D =I; then ~ y(t) should be close
to ~ v(t) (Fig. 5).
