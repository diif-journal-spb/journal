Abstract
The paper treats the transformation of the concentrated form of the func-
tional (associated to the  nite elements method { FEM) attached to the reso-
lution of the three dimensional (3D)  eld from the inhomogeneous, non-linear
and anisotropic systems that have random main directions of magnetisation.
We have got the useful form of the functional which is used in the numerical
computation of the distribution of the  eld created by permanent magnets.
Key words: permanent magnets, FEM, inhomogenity, nonlinearity, anisotropy.Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2001
1. Introduction
In practice, there appear situations when it is necessary to establish the
distribution of the magnetic  eld in inhomogeneous, non-linear and anisotropic
systems (concerning both permanent magnets {  eld sources { and ferromag-
netic yokes existing in the real technical system).
The concentrated form of the functional, valid for the systems with perma-
nent magnets [1, 2], written in Eq(1)

must be transformed in order to be used in computations, as it follows. We
have made the mention that v is the domain (volume) where the  eld problem
has been analysed, and S
N
is its boundary with Neumann conditions. Eq(1)
contains three unknown quantities:
 
B { ux density,
 
H { magnetic  eld
intensity and V
H
{ magnetic scalar potential. In the process of minimising of
the functional it is necessary an expression containing only one variable.
The  eld sources being permanent magnets,
 
H is obtained from the mag-
netic scalar potential V

H =   gradV

there have
to be known the Neumann conditions and for S

{ the Dirichlet condi-
tions. In a general case there can be more zones with permanent magnetisation,
when v
00
is a reunion of there and v
0
is the reunion of all the zones without
permanent magnetisation, having a similar meaning as those for boundaries S
00
and S
0
.
2. Anisotropic and non-linear 3D permanent magnets
with random main directions of magnetisation
For anisotropic media with permanent magnets, the law of the link between
 
B;
 
H and
 
M has become
 
B =
 
   
p
 
H +  
0
 
M
p
; (4)
where
 
   
p
is tensor of magnetic permeability in the zone with permanent magnet
[4]. For the ferromagnetic yokes, considered anisotropic,
 
B =
 
   
 
H, and for
the non-ferromagnetic zones (e.q. the zones with air),
 
B =  
0
 
H. It is known
that, following the main directions of magnetisation, the components of the ux
density are collinear with the components of the magnetic  eld intensity, namely
tensors
 
   
p
and
 
    have diagonal matrices [4, 5]. Taking into consideration a
3D domain where the main directions of magnetisation, in random disposition,
are noted with (u; v; w)
0
in the zones with
 
M
p
= 0, and with (u; v; w)
00
in
the permanent magnet, the linking relations between
 
B and
 
H after there
directions are
B
 
=  
 
H
 
;   = u
0
; v
0
; w
0

for ferromagnetic yokes, and
B
 
=  
p 
H
 
+  
0
M
p 
;   = u
00
; v
00
; w
00
(6)
for the zones with permanent magnetisation. For the considered case, tensors
 
   
p
and
 
    have got non-linear components, depending on
 
H. Eq(5) show
that a component of the ux density following one of the main directions of
magnetisation depends only on the components of the magnetic  eld intensity
following the same direction, namely after the main directions of magnetisation
 
B and
 
H components are collinear. In other words, the components follow-
ing the main directions of magnetisation do not depend one on another. For
zones with permanent magnets (Eq.6) there also intervene the components of
permanent magnetisation, which have to be known for a given magnet.

Within the  nite element method (FEM), the domain of 3D analysis is
divided in m  nite elements (e.q. tetrahedra), of su ciently small elements, so
that the calculus accuracy be good. In this case, functional (1) can be written

, and index   represents the fact that the quantities refer to  nite element  .
For the ferromagnetic materials (non-linear and anisotropic) contained in
sub-domain v
0
, there are not known in advance the working points (for each
 nite element) on the magnetisation curves, curves that have to be known.
Therefore, the components of tensors
 
   
 
are initially unknown. The process of
solving the  eld problem  nally implies solving a system of equations (obtained
through minimising the functional (8)) where the unknown quantities are mag-
netic scalar potentials V
Hi
(i = 1; n) from the n nodes of the discretization
mesh of study domain v. As
 
   
 
has got unknown values, solving the system
of equations implies more iterations, starting from initially chosen values for
the components of the tensor, and correcting them at each iteration. If the
process is convergent, there are  nally obtained stable values for
 
   
 
, differing
from one  nite element to the other. Thus, in an iteration, the resolution of
the system obtained from Eq(8) is done for the steady components of tensors
 
   
 
(as against
 
H
 
), but different for different  .

For the non-linear and anisotropic permanent magnets contained in subdo-
main v
00
the problem is alike, but we have to take into consideration
 
   
p 
. The
demagnetisation curves of the magnets following each main direction have to
be known.
The unit vectors of the random main directions (u; v; w)
0
of zone v
0
are
considered (  e

(u; v; w)

of the permanent magnet (zone v

;   e

)
00
(see
Fig.2, where index
0
is for v
0
and index
00
for v

). If we take into consideration
Eqs(5) and (6) and the above mentioned observations, the terms of functional
(8) can be written as following:

Fig.3. The position of the
reference systems
In this context, in Fig.3 there is taken into consideration the general case of
relative disposal of the rectangular system (x; y; z) against the system attached
to the main directions of magnetisation (u; v; w). The representation has been
done by a single drawing for both subdomain v
0
and v
00
, having the following
meaning: for v
0
, the system of axes (u; v; w)
0
and angles ('
ux
; '
uy
; '
uz
; : : :)
0
will wear index
0
; for v
00
, the axes and angles will be marked by index
00
, namely
(u; v; w)
00
and ('
ux
; '
uy
; '
uz
; : : :)
00
. For reasons of clearness of the drawing, in
Fig.3 we have noted only part of the angles, the rest of them being obvious.
In order to obtain the linking relations between the components in the two
systems of reference, in a random  nite element   we have expressed
 
H
 
in
system (x; y; z) and then in system (u; v; w). The formulation is similar in
subdomains v
0
and v
00
, thus the appropriate indices (
0
and
00
) being required
only when the equations are completely written (22 and 29). Thus, on one hand

This is the useful form of the functional in calculus, the only unknown
quantity being magnetic scalar potential V

.
3. Conclusions
Getting Eq (33) means an important intermediary stage in solving the
 eld problem in inhomogeneous 3D domains, with non-linear and anisotropic
permanent magnets and ferromagnetic yokes, having random main direction
of magnetisation. In notations \A " and \K " (see Eqs 23-32), there inter-
vene the  eld sources too (permanent magnetisation
 
M
p 
), the parameters of
magnetic circuit materials
 
   
 
and
 
   
p 
(obtained from the non-linear magneti-
sation curves of the ferromagnetic yokes, and those of the demagnetisation of
permanent magnets), the relative disposal of the main magnetisation axes in

comparison with a chosen rectangular system, as well as the Neumann con-
ditions (B
n
)
 
on the boundary of the domain. All these have to be known
so that, for a system with a given geometry, the solution of  eld problem be
unique.
For the above mentioned case (inhomogeneous, non-linear and anisotropic
system having random main direction), the transformation of the functional
{ in order to obtain a form that can be used in the numerical computations
{ has got an increased complexity, due to the degree of generality taken into
consideration.
