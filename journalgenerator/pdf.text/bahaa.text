Abstract
A time optimal control problem for in¯nite order parabolic equations is
considered. A time optimal control problem is replaced by an equivalent one
with a performance index in the form of integral form. Constraints on controls
are assumed. To obtain the optimality conditions for the Neumann problem,
the generalization of the Dubovitskii-Milyutin Theorem given by Walczak in
Refs.[41,42] was applied.
1 Introduction
In recent years, signi¯cant emphasis has been given to the study of optimal
control for systems governed by parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential
equations with ¯rst boundary conditions or with Cauchy conditions. In these
studies, the differential equations are either in general form or in divergence
form. Questions concerning necessary conditions for optimality and existenceDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2005
of optimal controls for these problems have been investigated for example in
[8-19,22-43].
In (Refs. [15,18,19,29,32]), the optimal control problems for systems de-
scribed by parabolic and hyperbolic operators with in¯nite order and consist
of one equation have been discussed. Also we extended the discussion in [9-12]
to n£n coupled systems of elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic types involving
different types of operators. To obtain optimality conditions the arguments of
(Ref.[38]) have been applied.
MakinguseoftheDubovitskii-Milyutintheoremfrom[20]),following(Refs.
[22-35])Kotarskihaveobtainednecessaryandsu±cientconditionsofoptimality
for similar systems governed by second order operator with an in¯nite number
ofvariablesandwithDirichletandNeumannboundaryconditions. Theinterest
in the study of this class of operators is stimulated by problems in quantum
¯eld theory.
In [1] a distributed Pareto optimal control problem for the parabolic opera-
torwithanin¯nitenumberofvariablesandwithNeumannboundaryconditions
is considered. In [2] a time optimal control problem for parabolic equations
with an in¯nite number of variables is considered. In [29] a distributed control
problem for a hyperbolic system with mixed control state constraints involving
operatorofin¯niteorderisconsidered. In[31]adistributedcontrolproblemfor
Neumann parabolic problem with time delay is considered. Also in [32], a dis-
tributed control problem for a hyperbolic system involving operator of in¯nite
order with Dirichlet conditions is considered.
In this paper, the application of the generalized Dubovitskii- Milyutin The-
orem from [41,42] will be demonstrated on an optimization Neumann problem
for system described by parabolic operator with in¯nite order. A time optimal
control problem for in¯nite order parabolic equations is considered. A time
optimal control problem is replaced by an equivalent one with a performance
index in the form of integral form. Constraints on controls are assumed.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce some func-
tional spaces with an in¯nite order. In section 3, we formulate the optimal
control problem and we introduce the main results of this paper. In section 4,
we introduce a real example for this problem.

3.1 An equivalent optimization problem
Theoptimizationproblem(3.1)-(3.6)canbereplacedbyanotherequivalentone
with a ¯xed time T and a performance index in a form of integral (compare
with [40]). To show that we need two auxiliary theorems.
Theorem 3.2 Let T
0
> 0 be the optimal time for the problem (3.1)-(3.6). If
intK6=;; then
y(x;T
0
)2@K (boundary ofK) (10)
for any y satisfying (3.1)-(3.4).
Proof Any solution of (3.1)-(3.3) is continuous with respect to t. If (3.10)
is not true, then there exists an admissible state y such as y(x;T
0
) 2 intK:
Thus a
^
T < T
0
exists so that y(x;
^
T)2 K: This contradicts the optimality of
T
0
and hence (3.10) must be ful¯lled.
Electronic Journal.  69Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2005
Theorem 3.3 Let T
0
> 0 be the optimal time for the problem (3.1)-(3.6), let
u
0
and y
0
be an optimal control and the corresponding state, respectively. Then
with the assumptions given above there exists a non-trivial element g2L
2
(R
n
)
so that the pair (y
0
;u
0
) is optimal for the following control problem with the
¯xed time T
0
:
I(y;u):=
Z
R
n
g(x)y(x;T
0
)dx!min (11)
subject to the constraints (3.1)-(3.3).
Proof The linearity of the equations (3.1)-(3.3) implies that the endpoints
y(x;T
0
) of all admissible states y form a convex set Y
T
0. From Theorem (3.1)
we have Y
T
0\intK =; and y
0
(0;T
0
)2 @K. Since intK 6=; thus there exists
a closed hyperplane separating Y
T
0 and K containing y

(x;T

Remark 3.5 The method fails if intK =;; e:g. in the case when K consists
of a single point.
3.2 Optimality conditions
Now based on Theorem (3.2) we can be ready to formulate the necessary con-
dition of optimality for problem (3.1)-(3.6).

Theorem 17.1 [38] may be applied to this example. Hence the theorem covers
the case of boundary control.
Remark 4.2 Theorem 17.1 [38] may be modi¯ed without any di±culty to cover
the case of systems with Dirichlet boundary conditions (cf [38] section 9) and
where the control is exercised through the boundary.
Comments
The main result of the paper contains necessary and su±cient conditions of
optimality (of Pontryagin's type) for in¯nite order parabolic system that give
characterization of optimal control. But it is easily seen that obtaining ana-
lytical formulas for optimal control is very di±cult. This results from the fact
that state equations (3.12)-(3.15), adjoint equations (3.16)-(3.18) and maxi-
mumconditions (3.19)-(3.20) are mutuallyconnected that cause that the usage
ofderivedconditionsisdi±cult. Thereforewemustresignfromtheexactdeter-
miningoftheoptimalcontrolandthereforeweareforcedtouseapproximations
methods. Those problems need further investigations and form tasks for future
research.
Also it is evident that by modifying:
- the boundary conditions,
- the nature of the control (distributed, boundary),
- the nature of the observation,
- the initial differential system,
an in¯nity of variations on the above problem are possible to study with
the help of Dubovitskii-Milyutin formalism.
