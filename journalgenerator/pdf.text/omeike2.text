Abstract: Su cient conditions are established for the asymptotic stability
of the zero solution of some non-autonomous delay differential equations of the
third order. Our result improves on Sadek's [A.I. Sadek, On the stability of so-
lutions of some non-autonomous delay differential equations of the third order,
Asymptotic Analysis 43(2005) 1-7].
Keywords: Stability, Lyapunov functional, non-autonomous differential equa-
tions of third order with delay
1. Introduction Consider the third-order nonautonomous delay differential
equations

where a(t);b(t) and c(t) are positive and continuously differentiable functions
on [0;1);r is positive constant; f(x) is continuous function and f(0) = 0.
In recent years many books and papers dealt with the delay differential
equations and obtained many good results, for example, [1,2,3,6,4,9,5,8,7,10-20]
, etc. In many references, the authors dealt with the problems by considering
Lyapunov functions or functionals and obtained the criteria for the stability.
Recently, Sadek [18] discussed the asymptotic stability of the zero solution
of (1.1) and the following result was proved.
Theorem A (Sadek [18]).Suppose that a(t);b(t) and c(t) are continuously dif-
ferentiable on [0;1) and the following conditions are satis ed:
(i) A a(t) a

Obviously, this is a very interesting result but Theorem A has some hypotheses
which are not necessary for the stability of solutions of (1.1).
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal/ 19Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2010
Our aim in this paper is to further study the stability of the zero solution of
(1.1). In the next section, we establish a criterion for the asymptotic stability
of the zero solution of (1.1), which extends and improves Theorem A.
Our main result is the following theorem.
Theorem 1.1.Suppose thata(t);b(t) andc(t) are continuously differentiable on
[0;1) and the following conditions are satis ed;

From ( rst term of) (1), it follows that b(t) and c(t) are non-decreasing
functions on [0;1) and the limit of each exists as t!1. Since L in (1) is an
arbitrary selected bound, we can also assume that

Remark 1.1. If (1.1) is the constant coe cient delay differential equation
:::
x +a x + _ x +cx(t r) = 0, then conditions (1)-(2) reduce to the Routh-Hurwitz
conditions a > 0;c > 0 and a > c. To show this we let a(t) = a;b(t) = 1 and
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal/ 20Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2010
c(t) = 1 and f(x(t r)) =cx(t r).
2. Preliminaries and Stability Results
We shall in this section give the stability results for (1.1), (hence for system
(1.2)). First, we will give the stability criteria for the general non-autonomous
delay differential system. We consider
_ x =f(t;x
t
); x

=x(t + );  r    0; (2:1)
wheref : [0;1) C
H

sets andf(t; 0) = 0: Here (C;k k) is the Banach space of continuous functions  :
[ r; 0]!IR
n
with the supremum norm,C
H
is the open H-ball inC. Standard
existence theory [4]shows that if  2C
H
and t  0, then there is at least one
continuous solutionx(t;t

; ) on [t
0
;t

+ff) satisfying (2.1) fort>t

;x
t
(t

  and ff some positive constant; if there is a closed subsetB C
H
such that
the solution remains inB, thenff =1. Also, (1.1) will denote the norm inIR
n
withjxj = max
1 i n
jx
i
j.
We are concerned here with stability in the context of Lyapunov's direct
method. Thus, we are concerned with continuous, strictly increasing functions
W
i
: [0;1) ! [0;1) with W
i
(0) = 0, called wedges, and with Lyapunov
functionals, V .
De nition 2.1 [8]. A continuous functional V : [0;1) C
H
! [0;1) which
is locally Lipschitz in   is called a Lyapunov functional for (2.1) if there is a
wedge W with
(i) W (j (0)j) V (t; ); V (t; 0) = 0; and

We have the following fundamental de nitions:
De nition 2.2 [8]. (Stability de nitions). Since f(t; 0) = 0; x(t)  0 is a
solution of (2.1) and its is said to be

implies thatjx(t;t

(b) uniformly stable if for each  > 0;t  0 there is a   > 0 such that [k k<

; )j< ;
(c) asymptotically stable if it is stable and if for each t  0 thee is a  > 0
such thatk k< implies thatjx(t;t
0
; )j! 0 as t1;
(d) uniformly asymptotically stable if it is uniformly stable and if there is a
 > 0 and for each   > 0 there is a T > 0 such that [t  0;k k < ;t 
t
0
+T ] implies thatjx(t;t
0
; )j< .
The following is the classical theorem on uniform stability for the solution
of (2.1). It goes back to Krasovskii [14].
Theorem 2.1 [7].If there is a Lyapunov functional for (2.1) and wedges satis-
fying:
(i) W
1
(j (0)j) V (t; ) W
2
(k k) and
(ii)
_
V
(2:1)
(t;x
t
)  0.
Then x = 0 is uniformly stable.
The basic conjecture for (2.1) on uniform asymptotic stability also goes back
to Krasovskii [14] and may be stated as follows.
Theorem 2.2 [7].If there is a Lyapunov functional for (2.1) and wedges such
that:
(i) W
1
(j (0)j) V (t; ) W
2
(k k) and
(ii)
_
V

(t;x
t
)  W

(jx(t)j):
Then the zero solution of (2.1) is uniformly asymptotically stable.
3. Proof of Theorem 1.1.

We consider, in place of (1.1) the equivalent system form

we note that the zero of (3.1) is uniformly asymptotically stable.
Remark 3.1. Clearly, our theorem is an improvement and extension of Theo-
rem A. In particular, from our theorem we see that (iv) assumed in Theorem
A is not necessary, and (i) (ii) and (iii) can be replaced by (1),(2) and (3) of
Theorem 1.1 respectively, for the uniform asymptotic stability of the zero solu-
tion of (1.1).
