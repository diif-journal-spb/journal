Abstract
The existence of weak solutions of integral equations and some coupled systems
of integral equations have been studied, on some suitable assumptions, by some
authors. In this work we concern with a coupled system of nonlinear Volterra-
Urysohn functional integral equations in the reexive Banach space E. The
existence of weakly continuous solutions, in the Banach space C[I;E]; will
be proved under some certain assumptions concerning the functional equations
that under the integral sign.
As an application, the coupled system of nonlinear Volterra-Hammerstien func-
tional integral equations is also studied.

1 Introduction and Preliminaries
Let I = [0;T ]; and let L
1
(I) be the class of all Lebesgue integrable functions
de ned on the intervalI. LetE be a reexive Banach space with normk:k and
dual E
 
:
Denote C[I;E] the Banach space of strongly continuous functions x : I! E
with sup-norm.
Indeed the existence of weak solutions of the integral and differential equations
and the coupled systems of integral equations have been extensively investigated
by a number of authors and there are many interesting results concerning this
problems (see[1]-[3], [5]-[7], [9]-[11] and [13]).
The existence of at least one weak solutions for the coupled systems of integral
equations of Uryshon type in a reexive Banach spaces was proved in (see[6]),
where x takes values in reexive Banach spaces, f
i
are weakly sequentially
continuous and weakly measurable on I and

Now we present some auxiliary results that will be need in this work.
Let E be a Banach space and let x :I!E, then

(1) x(:) is said to be weakly continuous (measurable) at t
0
2 I if for every
 2X
 
;  (x(:)) is continuous (measurable) at t
0
.
(2) A function h : E! E is said to be sequentially continuous if h maps
weakly convergent sequence in E to weakly convergent sequence in E .
If x is weakly continuous on I , then x is strongly measurable and hence
weakly measurable (see[4] and[8]). Note that in reexive Banach spaces weakly
measurable functions are pettis integrable (see[8] and [12] for the de nition) if
and only if  (x(:)) is Lebesgue integrable on I for every  2E
 
.
Now we state a  xed point theorem and some propositions which will be used
in the sequal (see[10]).
Theorem 1 "O'Regan  xed point theorem"
Let E be a Banach space and let Q be a nonempty, bounded, closed and
convex subset of the space (C[0;T ];E) and let A : Q! Q be a weakly
sequentially continuous and assume that AQ(t) is relatively weakly compact
in E for each t2 [0;T ]. Then A has a  xed point in the set Q.
Proposition 1 A subset of a reexive Banach space is weakly compact if and
only if it is closed in the weak topology and bounded in the norm topology.
Proposition 2 Let E be a normed space with y 6= 0. Then there exists a
 2E
 
withk k = 1 andkyk = (y).
2 Existence of weak solutions
This section deals with the existence of weak continuous solutions for the cou-
pled system of nonlinear Volterra-Urysohn integral equations (1)-(2).
Let f
i
: I E! E; i = 1; 2 be a nonlinear single-valued maps, assume that
f
i
; i = 1; 2 satisfy the following assumptions:
(I) f
i
(t;s;:); i = 1; 2 are weakly sequentially continuous in x2 E for each
t;s2I I.
(II) f
i
(t;:;x(:)); i = 1; 2 are weakly measurable on I for each x2E.
(III) f
i

T < 1; i = 1; 2.
De nition 1 LetX be the class of all ordered pairs (u;v); u;v2C[I;E], with
normk(u;v)k =kuk +kvk.
De nition 2 By a weak solution of the coupled system (1)-(2) we mean the
ordered pair of functions (x;y)2X; x;y2C[I;E] such that
 (x(t)) = (h

Now for the existence of a weak continuous solution of (1)-(2) we have the
following theorem
Theorem 2 Let the assumptions (I)-(VI) be satis ed. Then the coupled sys-
tem of the nonlinear functional integral equations (1)-(2) has at least one weak
continuous solution (x;y)2X; x;y2C[I;E].

Now Q

It remains to prove that A is weakly sequentially continuous.
LetfU

r

n
g;fx
n
g
converges weakly to y; x, respectively, i.e. y
n

n
(t) * x; 8t2 I
weakly.
Sincef
1
(t;s;y(m
1
(s))) andf
2
(t;s;x(m
2
(s))) are weakly sequentially continuous
in y and x, then f
1
(t;s;y

(m

2
(t;s;x
n
(m
2
(s))) converges weakly to
f
1
(t;s;y(m
1
(s))) and f
2
(t;s;x(m

(s))) respectively.
Thus  (f

(t;s;y

(m

(t;s;y(m

By applying Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem for Pettis integral, then

sequentially continuous (i.e. AU

Since all conditions of O'Regan theorem are satis ed, then the operator A has
at least one  xed point U 2 Q
r
, and hence the coupled system of nonlinear
functional integral equations (1)-(2) has at least one weak solution.
3 Application
This section, as an application, deals with the existence of weak continuous so-
lution for the coupled system of nonlinear Volterra-Hammerstien integral equa-
tions (3)-(4).
Let g

g

(i) g

(ii) g
i

(iii) There exists an integrable functions a

De nition 3 By a weak solution of the coupled system (3)-(4) we mean the
ordered pair of functions (x;y)2X; x;y2C[I;E] such that

Now for the existence of a weak continuous solution of (3)-(4) we have the
following theorem
