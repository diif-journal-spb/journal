Abstract 
In this paper, we establish the existence criteria for at least three positive solutions of an arbitrary two-
point boundary value problem for nonlinear third order ordinary differential equation. The analysis of 
this paper is based on  Leggett-William’s fixed point theorem and Krasnoselskii’s fixed point theorem. 
Some new existence and multiplicity results for nonlinear third order ordinary differential equation 
with arbitrary two-point boundary value conditions are obtained. The results of this paper extend and 
modify the corresponding results of several authors in literature. Some illustrative examples are given 
to support the analytic proof.  
 
Keywords: arbitrary two-point boundary value problem; positive solution; Leggett-William’s fixed 
point theorem; Krasnoselskii fixed point theorem; 
 
1  Introducion 
Third-order ordinary differential equation is used to explain different physical systems, as for example 
we mention that the deflection of a curved beam having a constant or a varying cross section, the 
three-layer beam, the electromagnetic waves or the gravity driven flows, see for instance [12] and 
references therein. In the last few decades, the existence of positive solutions of two-point, three-point 
and four-point boundary value problems for third order nonlinear ordinary differential equations has 
extensively been studied by using various techniques, see for instance [1-4, 6-7, 9-11, 13, 15-16, 18-
27] and references therein. But there is a little number of works about the existence of positive Differential Equations and Control Processes, № 2, 2019

solutions for the nonlinear boundary value problem (for short BVP) with arbitrary point boundary 
conditions. Using the Leggett-William’s fixed point theorem [17], Agarwal and O’Regan [5] 
established the principle for the existence of three positive solutions to a class of second order 
impulsive differential equations and Anderson [3] developed the principle for existence of at least 
three positive solutions to a third order three-point boundary value problem. By means of the 
Krasnoselskii’s fixed point theorem [14], Anderson and Davis [2] established the principle for the 
existence of multiple positive solutions to third order three-point right focal boundary value problem. 
Recently, in 2009 and 2008, Liu et al. [15] and  Liu et al. [16] studied the existence of three positive 
solutions of the following nonlinear third order arbitrary two-point boundary value problems by 
applying both of the Leggett-William’s fixed point theorem [17] and Krasnoselskii’s fixed point 
theorem [14]:

2  Prelimaniry Notes 
In this section, we recall some basic definitions and state the Leggett-William’s fixed point theorem 
and the Krasnoselskii’s fixed point theorem, which are essential to establish main results. 
Definition 2.1. Let 
 
,. B be a real Banach space and P be a nonempty closed convex subset of B . 
Then we say that P is a cone on B if it is satisfies the following properties: 
(i) cP   for , 0; cP    
(ii) , c c P  implies c   ,  
where  denotes the null element of B . 
Definition 2.2. A mapping  is said to be a non-negative continuous concave functional on the cone 
P if 
  : 0, P     is continuous and

Proof. The proofs and computations are regular and we omit them.       ∎ 
Remark 2.1. By Lemma 2.1, we can convert the BVP defined by (1.3) and (1.4) as the following 
integral equation

, , , for all , ,

                (2.4) 
where   , G t s is the Green’s function given by (2.3). It is also noted that, the Green’s function 
  , G t s have the following properties:  
(I)   , G t s is continuous on 
   
, , , a b a b   
(II)          

(III)    
, 0, forall , , . G t s t s a b  
Obviously, 
   
,, u a b a b  is a solution of the BVP (1.3) and (1.4), if and only if it is a solution of the 
integral equation (2.4). Furthermore, if we consider a cone K on
 
, C a b and define an integral operator 
: A K K  by  
       
, , , for all ,
b
a
Au t G t s f s u s ds u K 

                (2.5) 
then it is easy to see that the BVP (1.3) and (1.4) has a solution   u u t  if and only if u is a fixed 
point of  the operator A defined by (2.5). 
Lemma 2.2. If the following condition  
    
00
,0 0, , , f t forsomet a b                    (2.6) 
is satisfied, then each solution 
 
, u C a b  of the BVP (1.3) and (1.4) satisfies 0. u   
Proof. The proof is trivial.              ∎

Hence, all the assumptions of the Theorem 2.1(Leggett-Williams Fixed Point Theorem) are satisfied 
by the integral operator A defined by (3.6). Therefore, according to the Theorem 2.1, we can say that 
the integral operator A has at least three fixed points

Thus Lemma 2.2, Remark 2.1 and (3.8) confirm that the BVP defined by (1.3) and (1.4) has at least 
three positive solutions

,, c u u u K  satisfying (3.5). This completes the proof.      ∎ 
Next, we establish other principles for existence of three positive solutions to the BVP (1.3) and (1.4) 
applying Theorem 2.1.

Proof. To prove this theorem, it is enough to show that there exists  
00

i.e.,      
, , , , 0, . f t u pc t a b u c    
Now, if f is bounded on
    , 0, ab    , the it is clear that there exists  
00

      , , , , 0, f t u pc t a b u      . 
And, if f is unbounded on
    , 0, ab    , then the continuity of f and (3.10) imply that there exist 
 

Hence, (3.4) is satisfied and the proof follows from Theorem 3.1. This completes the proof. ∎

Conclusion 
In this study, we have established general principles for checking the existence of three positive 
solutions of nonlinear third order arbitrary two-point boundary value problem defined by (1.3) and 
(1.4) applying Leggett-William’s fixed point theorem and Krasnoselskii’s fixed point theorem. By 
using any one of our Theorem 3.1 to Theorem 3.8, one may check the existence of three positive 
solutions of BVP (1.3) and (1.4). The results of this paper have modified of the corresponding results 
of Liu et al. [15] and Liu et al. [16]. Finally, we have verified our results by some particular examples.
