1 Introduction
Fractional differential equations have many applications in modeling of physical and chemical
processes and in engineering and have been of great interest recently. In its turn, mathematicalDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2012
aspects of studies on fractional differential equations were discussed by many authors, see the
text books [1,2], the survey papers [3,4] and papers [5-10] and the references therein.
Recently the coincidence degree theory [11] has been used to study the existence of solutions
to boundary value problems for fractional differential equations [12-15].
In [15], the existence of solutions of the resonant boundary value problems for fractional
differential equations

x and solutions of BVP(1.1) are bounded
on [0; 1]. To our knowledge, there exists no paper concerned with the existence of unbounded
solutions of boundary value problems for fractional differential equations.
We  nd that in all above mentioned papers, the solutions obtained are bounded ones
(continuous on [0; 1], f depends on either the fractional derivatives lower than ff  1 [15,18].
Motivated by this reason, we discuss the boundary value problem of the nonlinear fractional
differential equation of the form

point boundary conditions.
2 Main results
To obtain the main results, we need some notations and an abstract existence theorem by
Gaines and Mawhin [11].
Let X and Y be Banach spaces, L : D(L)  X! Y be a Fredholm operator of index
zero, P : X!X, Q : Y!Y be projectors such that
ImP = KerL; KerQ = ImL; X = KerL  KerP; Y = ImL  ImQ:
It follows that
Lj
D(L)\KerP
: D(L)\ KerP! ImL
is invertible, we denote the inverse of that map by K
p
.
If 
 is an open bounded subset of X, D(L)\ 
6=;, the map N : X!Y will be called
L compact on 
 if QN(
) is bounded and K
p
(I Q)N : 
!X is compact.
Lemma 1 Let L be a Fredholm operator of index zero and let N be L compact on 
. Assume
that the following conditions are satis ed:
1. Lx6= Nx for every (x; )2 [D(L)n KerL)\@
]  (0; 1);
2. Nx = 2 ImL for every x2 KerL\@
;
3. deg(^

QN
 
 
KerL
; 
\ KerL; 0)6= 0, where^
 1
: Y=ImL! KerL is the inverse of the
isomorphism^ : KerL!Y=ImL.
Then the equation Lx =Nx has at least one solution in D(L)\ 
.

3. L is a Fredholm operator of index zero.
Proof
(1) One sees that D

u(t) = 0 has solutions
u(t) =c

t
ff 1
+c
2
t
ff 2
;t2 (0; 1)
for some c
i
2R; i = 1; 2: We get
I

u(t) =c

 (ff)t +c

 (ff  1)
and
[I

0
+
u(t)]

=c

 (ff);
and
D
 
0
u(t) =c

 (ff)
 (ff  )
t
ff   1
+c
2
 (ff  1)
 (ff    1)
t
ff   2
:
Since
[I
2 ff
0
+
u(t)]
0
 
 
t=0
= 0;
we get c
1
= 0. Since
P
m 2
i=1
 
i
 
ff   2
i
= 1, we  nd that c

2R. Thus KerL =fct
ff 2
; c2Rg.
(2) We see that v2 ImL if and only if there exists a function u2D(L) such that

u(t) =v(t); t2 (0; 1); 1<ff  2;

Then

It follows that

From

On the other hand, suppose v2Y and satis es (2.2). Choose
u(t) =I
ff
0
+v(t):
One sees by computation that
D
ff

u(t) =

So

u(t) =

One has

u(1) =

Furthermore, we know that t

u2 C(0; 1] and there exist the limits
lim

u(t). Hence u2 D(L) and Lu = v. So v2 ImL. Then
(2) follows.

By the de nition of

(a) Lx6= Nx for x2 (D(L)n KerL)\@
 and  2 (0; 1);
(b) Nx = 2 ImL for x2 KerL\@
.
(c) deg(QNj
KerL
; 
\ KerL; 0) 6= 0: In fact, let H(x; ) =   ^ x + (1   )QNx.
According the de nition of 
, we know H(x; )6= 0 for x2 @
\ KerL, thus by
homotopy property of degree,
deg(QNj

\ KerL; 0) = deg(H( ; 0); 
\ KerL; 0)
= deg(H( ; 1);

Thus by Lemma 1,Lx =Nx has at least one solution inD(L)\
, which is a solution
of BVP(1.2). The proof is complete.

Now, we present an example, which can not be covered by known results, to illustrate Theorem
