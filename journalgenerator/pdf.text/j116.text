1 Introduction
Boundary layer ﬂow of electrically conducting ﬂuids ﬁnds applications in several
industrial and technological ﬁelds such as, for example, chemical, aerospace and
nuclear engineering. As a result, several theoretical investigations have been
carried out in the last four decades or so to primarily analyze the inﬂuence of
externally applied magnetic ﬁelds on a variety of ﬂows ﬁelds. In particular, a
number of hydromagnetic ﬂow problems have been reported in the literature to
consider the individual as well as the combined effects of magnetic, buoyancy
and viscous forces under certain simplifying assumptions.Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2003
It is well known that the partial differential equations which govern the ﬂow
of electrically conducting ﬂuids under the action of the magnetic and buoyancy
forces are highly nonlinear and coupled. However, when the ﬂow takes place
near ﬂat plates, the quadratic convection term in the momentum equation can
drop out, and the system thus becomes linear. It is therefore possible to obtain
exact closed form solutions of the linearized problem in a number of practically
important situations – for instance, when a stationary or moving bounding
plate is subject to heating, cooling or heat ﬂux conditions [1–5]. While the
majority of the relevant works reported in literature has emphasized the effects
of magnetic ﬁeld and buoyancy force on speciﬁcally chosen liquid and gaseous
media, the detailed analysis of the underlying real ﬂuid properties characterized
by the Prandtl numbers of the ﬂuids has not received much attention. Our
main objective in this study is thus to present exact analytical solutions for the
transient hydromagnetic impulsive ﬂow of ﬂuids of different Prandtl numbers
when the ﬂow takes place near a moving inﬁnite vertical plate subject to uniform
heat ﬂux. We have shown in our analysis that one needs to consider two separate
solutions – one for Pr  = 1 and the other for Pr = 1, Pr being the Prandtl
number of the ﬂuid under consideration. The explicit forms of these solutions
have been presented in a uniﬁed form for both the cases of the magnetic ﬁeld
being ﬁxed to the ﬂuid and to the plate. The variation of the boundary layer
velocity proﬁles with the Prandtl number has been shown for a combination of
Grashoff and Hartmann numbers.
2 Governing Equations
Consider the unsteady ﬂow of an inﬁnite extent of an electrically conducting
incompressible ﬂuid past a moving inﬁnite vertical ﬂat plate. With respect to
the rectangular cartesian coordinate system Oxyz,the axis Oz is taken along
the wall in the upward direction and the axis Oy is taken perpendicular to it
into the ﬂuid. The ﬂow is assumed to take place under the inﬂuence of an
external magnetic ﬁeld. The usual equations of motion of the ﬂuid, neglecting

ﬂuid, σ the electrical conductivity and c
p
is the speciﬁc heat of the ﬂuid at
constant pressure. In equations (2) and (3), d/dt is the convective derivative
operator.
For the two-dimensional motion considered here, at times t≤ 0, the plate
and the ﬂuid medium are assumed to be at rest and at the constant temperature
T
∞
. At time t> 0, the plate is set into motion in its own plane with a
velocity proportional to t
n
, and simultaneously, heat is also supplied to the
plate at a constant rate. A uniform magnetic ﬁeld of strength B
y
is applied
in the y direction. We consider two different ﬂow situations with respect to
the magnetic ﬁeld: (i) the magnetic lines of force are ﬁxed relative to the
ﬂuid, and (ii) the magnetic lines of force are ﬁxed relative to the boundary.
These two cases will, however, be incorporated into a single momentum equation
so as to obtain a uniﬁed solution. As is common in Stokes problems of ﬂow
near ﬂat boundaries, we assume that the effects of the convective and pressure
gradient terms in the momentum and energy equations are negligible. The
density of the liquid is assumed to be constant; however, in the case of free
convection ﬂow, it is considered variable in forming the buoyancy force. We also
assume that the magnetic Reynolds number is very small so that the induced
magnetic ﬁeld produced by the motion of the electrically conducting ﬂuid is
negligible in comparison with the applied one. As a result of the boundary layer
approximations, the physical variables become functions of the time variable
t and the space variable y only. Moreover, the only non-zero component of
velocity occurring in the analysis will be V
z
which we shall hereafter denote by
u(y,t). Under these assumptions, the boundary layer momentum equation can

3 Impulsive Motion
For impulsively moving vertical plate, we take the plate velocity as λ,which
corresponds to n = 0. We shall solve the boundary layer equations in dimen-
sionless forms. Using a characteristic length scale L = ν/λ, we introduce the
non-dimensional quantities

The initial and boundary conditions become
u=0,T =0 for y≥0and t≤ 0
u=1,∂T/∂y =−1at y =0 for t> 0
u→ 0,T →0as y→∞ for t> 0 (11)
We observe that the energy equation (10) is uncoupled from the momen-
tum equation (9). We can therefore solve for the temperature variable T(y,t)
whereupon u(y,t) can be obtained by solving equation (9). Taking Laplace
transforms of equations (9) and (10) with respect to the t-variable will result
in a set of (ordinary) differential equations for the transformed functions in
the independent variable y. The resulting solutions of temperature and veloc-
ity variables in the ys-plane can be inverted using standard inverses combined
with convolution [7, 8]. The solutions in the physical yt-plane can be written

accelerated motion of the vertical plate, (n  =0, 1), may also become impor-
tant in certain applications. Solutions of equation (5) for such cases will be
investigated separately.
4 Discussion of Results
As mentioned earlier, our main objective in this work is to analyze the variation
of the boundary layer velocity u(y,t) with the Prandtl number. In Figures 1–3,
we have shown the velocity proﬁles for a set of combinations of the Grashoff
number G and the magnetic parameter m for 0.1 ≤ Pr ≤ 10.0 in the early
stages of the onset of motion (t=0.1). The Figure 1 shows the velocity proﬁles
close to the boundary (y =0.1) while the Figure 2 depicts the proﬁles further
away from the bounding plate (y =0.5). The velocity proﬁles have been plotted
for the case of the applied magnetic ﬁeld, B
y
, being ﬁxed relative to the ﬂuid.
In general, velocity in the boundary layer is seen to decrease with Pr. The
decrease in the velocity is, however, more pronounced for those ﬂuids whose
Prandtl numbers are less than unity (e.g., air). It is also to be noted that
velocity variations are far more sensitive to the changes in the parameters G
or m when Pr is less than unity, as can be seen from the proﬁles in Figures
1 and 2. In other words, one may conclude that the effects of the applied
Electronic Journal.  83Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2003
magnetic ﬁeld or the buoyancy forces are dominant mainly for ﬂuids whose
Prandtl numbers are less than unity. Furthermore, in order to analyze the
response of the boundary layer velocity to the mode of application (K)of the
magnetic ﬁeld, we have plotted in Figure 3 the velocity proﬁles for a ﬁxed value
of the magnetic parameter m. It can be seen that the ﬂuid velocity variations
indeed depend upon whether the applied magnetic ﬁeld is ﬁxed relative to the
plate (K = 1) or to the ﬂuid (K = 0); the velocity in the former case is higher
than the one in the latter case for all values of the Prandtl number considered
in this study. This observation holds good for both low and moderate values of
the buoyancy parameter G.
