Abstract
We consider the 3-dimensional (3-D) model of the massive particles, represented as
the rest-mass energy-density wave-packets, which is analog to the common physical ob-
jects which we experiment in our every-day life, if we consider a physical object with a
mass m for example, as a matter/energy-density contained in this 3-D form, such that
the integration of this energy-density contained in this 3-D volume is equal to the energy
E =mc

.
This is a complete revision and improvement of previous work [10] or the analysis of
particle'sinternaldynamicduringparticle'saccelerationsandhenceweusethethreecon-
servation laws for the compressive °uids: energy/matter conservation, momentum con-
servation and internal energy conservation laws. Consequently, we show the new method
for computation of the hydrostatic equilibrium of a massive elementary particle during
inertialpropagationinavacuumwithastablesphericallysymmetricrest-massenergyden-
sity distribution, such that with this stationary distribution the internal self-gravitational
force is constant and equal in each point inside the particle. Then we show how the self-
gravitational forces generated by the rest-mass energy-density of massive particles in 3-D
provide the auto-stability process during the small perturbations, which cause particle's
accelerations, and their return to the inertial propagation in the vacuum.

1 Introduction
The standard QM with the probabilistic wavefunctions and their statistical en-
sembleinterpretationisbasedontheclassicalconceptofapoint-likeparticle and
donothavethetheoryabletodescribeanindividualparticlewithitstrajectory
andgivenmomentumandenergyinany¯xedinstanceoftime. Becauseofthat
as noted by Einstein it was an incomplete theory, differently from the classic
mechanics which has both statistical theory (for example the thermodynamic
of a gas) and theory for each individual object (Newton, Euler-Lagrange equa-
tionsforthemotionofanindividualobject). IntheproposedcompletionofQM
(providedrecentlyin[10])instead, anindividualmassiveparticle'swave-packet
always occupies a nonzero 3-D volume. It holds also for bosons when they
become unstable after an initial 'space explosion' and, consequently, assume
the massive particle behavior and a ¯nite but non-zero matter/energy-density
volume in open 3-D space. Consequently, in this theory [10] for elementary
particlesbasedonenergy-densitywave-packets, thepoint-likeparticlesareonly
the stable-state bosons when they propagate with speed of lightin the vacuum,
andwiththeirenergy-densitydistributedinhighercompacti¯eddimensions. In
the Kaluza-Klein approach, such particles with different quantized charges can
be simply obtained by addition of closed compacti¯ed dimensions where the
matter can propagate in one or in opposite direction and hence producing the
positive/negative quantized charge. Thus, as in the string theory, I assumed
the existence of a number of closed dimensions as well [11], which differentiate
the spin-zero neutral (basic feature) particles described by the complex scalar
wave-packets ª in what follows.
It was shown [7, 8, 9, 10] that, generally, any massive particle can be de¯ned
in the Minkowski time-space by the complex wave-packet

In any ¯xed instance of time t, this complex time-oscillation of the 'pilot-wave'
exists only in a very limited space volume, in the points
¡ !
r where particle's
density ©
m
(t;
¡ !

particle (notice that the complex 'pilot wave' is de¯ned only on the particle's
barycenter). So, it is a local oscillation embedded inside the matter of the
particle, and has no any propagation outside its matter, and hence it is not a
plain wave. In fact, if a particle is in the rest state (
¡ !
v = 0) we have the time-
invariant distribution © around its barycenter

located in a very small volume around its barycenter, and does not propagate

In the assumption [10] of the topology of the matter of an elementary massive
particle, the wave-packet do not undergo a spreading, also when it changes its
matter density distribution (i.e., its energy-density ©

), and tends to its stable
stationarysphericallysymmetricdistributionduringinertialpropagationinthe
vacuum. That is, the matter has some internal self-gravitational autocohesive

AnalogouslytotheEuler¯rstequationof°uiddynamics(continuityequation),

I am sorry, for me in that moment, after so lot of time that I tried to publish the principal results of this
new theory (and this Section 2.5 was only an addendum; all other part of this theory are independent of it), I

divide this theory in two thematic volumes and to obtain the printable version of them as soon as possible.

the spherically-symmetric particle's mass density during particle's hydrostatic
equilibrium (during an inertial propagation of a massive particle), and that
particle's stability must be explained differently.
This paper is in effect the revision of the errors in Section 2.5 in [10]. The ex-
planation of particle's stability needs much more mathematical apparatus and
another Euler's equation (or more complex Navier-Stokes momentum equa-
tion) derived from the Cauchy momentum equation. Both new equations in-
troduce the common concepts of the pressure inside particle's matter opposed
to particle's self-gravitational forces inside its matter, in order to guarantee the
particle's hydrostatic equilibrium (analogously to the equation of hydrostatic
equilibrium in the stars, for example).
In next section we will confront the conservation law (4) for an individual
massiveparticlewiththestatisticalBoltzmannequationtoverifyinwhichcon-
ditions the Boltzmann equation, which describes the statistical behaviour of
a thermodynamical system not in state of equilibrium, can be reduced to the
propertiesofthecontinuousandsimple-connectedparticle'smatteri©

that, we will analyze the particle's stability by using the Cauchystress 2-tensor

theory of gravitation applied to the particle's mass density.
2 Hydrostatic equilibrium of a massive particle
The duality relationship between the statistical SchrÄ odinger equation (where
complex wavefunction Ã represents the probabilistic density) appropriate for
an ensemble of particles and the deterministic new equation for an individual
elementary particle was discussed in details in [10]. Here we will discuss the
relationship between the continuity equation (4) for an individual elementary
particle and the Boltzmann equation for the °uids composed by the particles,

°uid system not in state of equilibrium. It can be used to determine how
physical quantities change, such as heat energy and momentum, when °uid is

viscosity, thermal conductivity, etc..
Let us consider this °uid composed by particles, each particle experiencing

It was proven only in 2010 that exact solutions to the Boltzmann equation are
always mathematically well-behaved [6]. This means that if a system obeying
the Boltzmann equation is perturbed, then it will return to equilibrium, rather
than diverging to in¯nity or behaving otherwise. However, this existence proof
is not helpful for solving the equation in realistic scenarios. Indeed, such state-
ments only tell us whether the solution subject to speci¯ed conditions exist,

but not how to ¯nd them. In practice, numerical methods are used to ¯nd
approximate solutions to the various forms of the Boltzmann equation.

For the coordinate system with the center in particle's barycenter, which will

is, in this coordinate system during this hydrostatic equilibrium we have that
the matter density of particle's body (thus also its rest-mass energy density

However, from the fact that, based on the General Relativity (GR), the rest-
mass energy density generates a local gravitational ¯eld (that is, a local time-
space curvature), this local gravitational force will involve each in¯nitesimal

also inside particle's mass density. It is enough to consider the non-relativistic
case, when the constant velocity of particle satis¯es v << c, so that there is
not any external ¯eld which would generate the accelerations, and to consider
that the local time-space of the vacuum in which propagates this particle is a

can be considered as a generator of the local Newtonian gravi-
tation, with the coordinate center in particle's barycenter, described in what
follows:
Newton's¯eld-theoretictheoryofgravitation: Newton'stheorywaspre-
sented as a two-body interaction theory, by importation of concepts and meth-
ods borrowed from electrostatics.
Let the density distribution of gravitating matter, relative to an inertial frame,
be described by the function ½(
¡ !
r), and let a test particle of mass ("gravita-
tional charge") m reside momentarily at
¡ !
r, so that the force experienced by
this test particle be
¡ !
F = m
¡ !
g(
¡ !
r), where the acceleration
¡ !
g(
¡ !
r) is the gravi-
tational analog of an electrostatic ¯eld
¡ !
E. The force-law proposed by Newton
is conservative, so r£
¡ !
g = 0, and hence we can introduce the gravitational
potential Á so that
¡ !
g =¡rÁ (9)
Hence, in mimicry of the electrostatic equation r¢
¡ !
E = ½ (charge density
regulates the divergence of the electric ¯eld), we obtain the differential for of
the Gauss's law for gravity
r¢
¡ !
g =¡4¼G½ (10)
where G is the gravitational constant and the minus sign re°ects the fact that
the gravitational interaction is attractive. Thus from (9) and (10) we obtain
the gravitational Poisson equation:

The spherical symmetry of the gravitational potential makes each star's mass-

This self-gravitational force, directed into the barycenter of the particle, in

This is in complete according with the fact that Einstein did not believe into
the reduction of gravity to geometry [1]

.
We need that the body of the particleh©
m
provides also the physical internal
pressure P(r) (which is a non-geometrical property) in order to guarantee the
hydrostaticequilibriumofthemassiveparticles. Thehydrostaticequilibriumof
a massive elementary particle demonstrated that the body of this particleh©
m
isamaterialsubstance,whichis°uidandelastic,andwhichcannotbereduced
to the time-space geometry. This real physical material substance generates a
curved time-space curvature inside and around it (the micro-island curvature),
but this material substance can not be simply 'generated by time-space curva-
ture'. That is, a massive elementary particle can not be reduced to the pure
geometry: seealsothedebateofEinsteinwithWillemdeSitterwhoconsidered
a solution of Einstein's GR in which there is no matter, as an exponentially
expanding empty universe), as claimed by Emile Meyerson that Einstein's GR
theory was the identi¯cation of matter with space (in his book La Deduction
Relativiste, 1925).
2
In effect, if we erroneously assume (as in my previous error in Section 2.5 in [10]) that during inertial
propagation (hydrostatic equilibrium) of the particle, the self-gravitational force inside particle's body is zero
then we would not need any internal pressure in the particle's body and hence would be possible to reduce
ontologically the elementary particle into the time-space geometry (from the fact that the particle's stability
could be completely explained by particle's self-gravity (time-space curvature)). Moreover, without internal
pressure of particle's body it will not be possible to have the elastic Compton collisions of the particles.

Hence, based on the concept of the equilibrium inside particle's body, we ex-
pect that the internal force F(r) during the hydrostatic equilibrium is constant
in each point inside particle's body. So, we obtain the following hydrostatic
equilibrium differential equation:

ible with the broad de¯nition provided in the Introduction above. Throughout

the theory of massive elementary particle [10] it is assumed that the particle's
bodies undergoing the action of external forces are perfectly elastic, i.e., that
they resume their initial form (in its hydrostatic equilibrium) completely after
removal of forces.
The elastic body of an elementary particle has no any molecular internal struc-
ture and hence the particle's matter is homogeneous and and continuously dis-
tributed over its volume so that the smallest element cut from the body pos-
sesses the same speci¯c physical properties as the whole body. That is, it is
assumedthattheparticle'sbodyis isotropic, i.e., thattheelasticpropertiesare
the same in all spatial directions. Moreover, we have no any thermodynamic
dissipation inside particle's body during its elastic deformations, that is, we
haveno thermal losses of particle's internalenergy during such elastic deforma-
tions caused by the external forces: the particle's kinetic energy converted into
its internal elastic potential energy V during elastic deformations have no any
side-effects of thermal losses.
The essence of elasticity is the reversibility. Forces applied to an elastic ma-
terial transfer energy into the material which, upon yielding that energy to
its surroundings, can recover its original shape. Elastic energy occurs when
objects are compressed and stretched, or generally deformed in any manner.
For an massive elementary particle it corresponds to energy stored by chang-
ing the internal forces of particle's hydrostatic equilibrium based on particle's
self-gravitational force.
Such properties of the particle's body differentiate it from the structural ma-
terials composed by the molecular structures as all material object used in our
every-day practice.
3 Other two conservation laws in °uid dynamics of the
elementary particles
Here we will consider another two conservation laws for the internal dynamic
inside the material substance of an massive elementary particle, not considered
previously in [10] (Section 2.5).
Hence, from the fact that inside the particle's material body we have a pres-
sure (17) that makes the balance with internal self-gravitational force (16), our
theory of massive elementary particles needs also the Cauchy conservation of
momentumequation(herewewillusethesimplerconvectiveformderivedfrom

can be continually subdivided into in¯nitesimal quantities.
In effect, the matter density of particle's body h©
m
, which is a continuous
material substance, must have the elastic property. That is, this body returns
to its rest shape (hydrostatic equilibrium) after applied stresses are removed.
For example, this property if a fundamental physical property of the material
elementary particles during the collisions with the Compton effects.
Following the classical dynamics of Newton and Euler, the motion of parti-
cle's material bodyh©

is produced by the action of externally applied forces
(during the interaction with the bosons of the fundamental ¯eld-forces, weak,
strong and electromagnetic, or with the external gravitational force) which are

face of the elementary particle's body, as a result of the mechanical interaction

momentum equation).
Here we consider that
¡ !
g is equal to the particle's self-gravitational internal
force (by considering that locally it is much bigger than the external gravita-
tional force). Obviously, the stress terms on the right-hand side of the equation

this equation will be used in next section for consideration of small perturba-
tions of particle's hydrostatic equilibrium with small spherical expansions of
particles body in connection with relatively small decelerations of the particle.
In effect, a particle's body is considered stress-free if it is in the hydrostatic
equilibrium (during inertial propagation of the particle), required to hold the
°uid body together and to keep its spherically symmetric density shape ©

,
in the absence of external interferences. Thus, in that equilibrium state, we
have that
¡ !
u(t;
¡ !
r) = 0 in all points inside particles body, so that
d
¡ !
u

= 0 and
the equaiton above (in the absence of viscosity) reduces to the equation (17)
of the pressure with spherically symmetric distribution during the hydrostatic
equilibrium.
¤
Let us consider now the enthalpy conservation and the speci¯c internal energy
of massive elementary particle. During the accelerations of an elementary par-
ticle (and its spherical expansion/compression), the internal pressure P which
was static and spherically symmetric inside particle's body during previous in-
ertial propagation (with the hydrostatic equilibrium), balansing the opposite
self-gravitational force, now changes in time during spherical expansion (when

Note that the speci¯c internal energy e keeps account of the gains and losses of

nal energy of a given state of a massive elementary particle cannot be directly
measured.
However, it is fundamental concept which explains the principles of 'internal

and described in Section 2.6 in [10], dedicated to phenomena of 'virtual parti-

4 Stability of massive particles: perturbations of their
hydrostatic equilibrium
In the case of the particle's accelerations, if it is generated by an external
gravitational force, we have that the particle is moving in a curved time-space
which changes this stable rest-mass density distribution of particle's hydro-
static equilibrium . Consequently, an in¯nitesimal particle's matter/energy
density at a point (t;
¡ !
r) begins to move, so that we obtain that the variation-
velocity in this point is different from zero, i.e.,

Active principle of particle's auto-stability: The self-gravitational forces,

principle of the auto-stability of the particles. After any acceleration, when a

g(r) given previously by equa-
tion (16), so that from the equation above, we obtain again the hydrostatic
pressure equation (17). This fact is obtained naturally: if there are external
forces that accelerate the particle, they generate an internal movement with
velocity
¡ !
u 6= 0 of its rest-mass density satisfying the equation (32), as a re-
action to these forces; if external forces are eliminated, then residual internal
self-gravitationalforceswillproduceagainthemovementofparticle'srest-mass
density up to the moment when the obtained new density distribution becomes
equal to that of hydrostatic equilibrium. This auto-equilibrium is realized in a
very short interval of time, when the particle passes from an acceleration into
an inertial propagation.
This fact demonstrated that the gravitational force is fundamental force in any
elementary particle, and the self-gravitational force of the particle generates
a curved time-space region around each particle (so called micro-island time-
space curvature). It is considered in details in [11] (Chapter 1), dedicated to

non-separability of the Quantum Mechanics theory from the General Relativ-
ity.
Another important property of the massive particle's auto-stability must be
the property which does not permit that the reduction of the radius r

particle's density ©

and hence does not permit a creation of a black hole (otherwise such a mi-
cro black hole would grow, by Compton interactions with other particles, and
the whole Universe would become composed by only the black holes). Conse-
quently,wecanassumethatthereexistsanaturallimittotheparticle'sdensity
compressibility which guarantee that a particle can not be transformed into a
black hole, and we can optionally extend the Topology Assumptions with the
following compressibility assumption:
De¯nition 1 Limit Compressibility Assumption:

©

(34)
where the ¯nite positive real constant ©

is the maximal possible density.
The consequence of such a limited compression of the particle's density is that:
² At any ¯nite 3-D region where ©
m
reaches this maximal possible den-
sity ©
1
, the internal self-gravitational force (oriented toward particle's
barycenter) in this region can not move any in¯nitesimal amount of this
limit-compressed density in this region;
² During any inertial propagation of the particle, for which we obtain a
spherically symmetric density distribution of ©
m
>0, with a barycenter in
the center of a sphere with radius r
0
, we have that the density ©
m
is equal
to this limit-compressed density ©
1
at least with an in¯nitesimally small
radius r
m
<< r
0
. This nucleus is generated during transition from accel-
erated particle into the auto-stable state of inertial particle's propagation.
It is based on the fact that the variation speed
¡ !
u of the particle's density
during the acceleration will be oriented toward the particle's barycenter
during reestablishment of the particle's auto-stability during inertial prop-
agation. The only contra-force to this density °ow toward the particle's
barycenter (of self-gravitational forces) is the gradient-pressure and this
resistance caused by maximal possible density.

Thus, the differential equations (38) and (39) in next section can be considered

where ©

depends on r.
That is, if in the hydrostatic equilibrium the particle has this "nucleus", inside
it we have a linearly decreasing gravitational force oriented to the barycenter,
which can not move the energy-density because it has the maximal possible
and uniform density and can not be compressed more, and the energy-density
also in this part of particle is in stationary state. Consequently, in the whole
particle's energy-density distribution we have the stationary condition that the

The perturbations of massive particles can be extremely strong, like in the case
of the sharp 3-D space symmetry breaking during an inertial propagation (as
in the case of the double-slit experiments for the electrons [10] with a rapid
transversal (cylindric) explosion of particle's body in a wide disk-like shape or-
thogonal to the direction of particle's trajectory and parallel to the very large
massive obstacle in front of this particle), or relatively small perturbations dur-
ing non-relativistic interactions with external ¯elds (the bosons) of external
gravitational forces. During extremely strong excitations, the particle's body
can become very large for an extremely short interval of time with very low
matter/energy density and without any "nucleus" composed by maximal den-
sity around particle's barycenter. However, after such a shot-time 3-D space
explosion of the particle's body, when again particle begins to propagate in
the ordinary vacuum 3-D space symmetry without any external solicitation,
the self-gravity will invert the direction of the °ow velocity

r) toward

cle's body, and the hypothesis in De¯nition 1 would guarantee that the particle
would not be transformed into a black-hole, by constitution (at least a mini-
mal) "nucleus" around particle's barycenter. In that cases it is reasonable to
assume that inside an in¯nitesimaly small sphere with radius r
m
<<r

around
particle's barycenter we do not have any movement of particle's density but
only in the rest of the particle's volume.
In next section we will consider this case of the small ordinary perturbations
(with consecutive de/accelerations) which ideally generate a spherically sym-
metric expansions/compressions of particle's body w.r.t. its spherically sym-
metric hydrostatic equilibrium body shape.

stance t = 0, and that for t > 0 particle is in°uenced by a small perturbation

Thus, let us consider the solution of the differential equation (4) for the rest-

Let us seek a solution for such a spherical expansion/compression of the par-
ticle's body for t¸ 0, by separating the variables, ©
m
(t;r) = T(t)R(r), where
T(t) is a dimensionless function while R(r) is a 3-D energy density function

is the time evolution of the rest-mass energy density and hence we ¯x its ini-
tial value at t = 0 by T(0) = 1. We ¯x also u

where k is a dimensionless constant real value (because left-hand side depends

while the radial velocity component u

and u

densitydiminisheswithtimeduringparticle'ssphericalexpansions(becausethe
total rest-mass energy is invariant), we conclude that:
² During the spherical expansion, when u
R

(energy density diminishes with time in any point inside the particle's
energy-density sphere with radius r

² During the spherical compression, when u

k >0 (energy density increases with time in any point inside the particle's
energy-density sphere with radius r

(t) which decreases with time).
Remark: the value jkj is proportional to the external force which causes this
spherical perturbation from the particle's hydrostatic equilibrium. In effect,
a bigger value of jkj will produce stronger changes of T(t) which represents

external force ¯eld (gravitational or other fundamental quantum ¯eld forces
mediated by the bosons). Consequently, it is a fundamental parameter which
represents the strength of this external force, and will be considered in what
follows as a given (non derived) parameter in all equations.

limit for the real value n is n < 3, because u
R

signs. Moreover, we can not permit that n< 0 because, in that case, we would
obtain that in the barycenter (for r = 0) we have the zero energy-density, in
contrast with the particle's topological properties.

It is easy to verify that the two examples above are the particular cases of this
corollary for n=1:0 and n=2:0.
Based on this corollary and the possible model of ©
m
(0;r) in the hydrostatic
equilibrium, let us try to ¯nd what can be the true candidate for 0 · n < 3
of the hydrostatic equilibrium. In effect, based on the equations (16) and (17)
for the hydrostatic equilibrium, the dependences of the self-gravitational ac-
celeration g(0;r), internal pressure P(0;g) and internal self gravitational force

From the fact that the pressure must be positive (against the self-gravitational
force) during the hydrostatic equilibrium, we can chose enough big constant
pressure P
0
such that the internal pressure on the particle's surface is enough
inordertoguaranteeitscompactnessduringtheelastic collisions betweenmas-
sive particle with Compton effects.
The ¯rst comment is that, for 1 < n < 3, we have the singularities with very
rapid changing of internal force for r 7! 0, which is not a property of equilib-
rium. Moreover, we have that on the particle's surface the internal pressure
is minimal instead of to be maximal (what is necessary in order to have the
elastic Compton effects during weak collisions between massive particles - in
that case the strong internal pressure on the particle's boundary (surface) is
more resistant to the deformations during the Compton-effect collisions, and
permits the fusion between two massive particles during the collisions only in
high-energy impacts.
Consequently, it seems reasonable to seek for the ideal model in the range
0· n < 1; in effect, the best candidate for the hydrostatic equilibrium is that
oneforwhichwehavethe equilibrium of the internal force (seetheLemma1)in
each point inside particle's body and hence the most simple (which is usually
also reasonable from the physicist's point of view that the good solutions in
nature are frequently the most simple solutions) model for the density of the
particle's body-matter h©

in particle's hydrostatic equilibrium seems to be

¡3n+2+0,
which has only one acceptable solution n=1=2 (other one is negative value¡2
which physically is not acceptable because we would have maximal particle's
density on its boundary surface and zero in the particle's barycenter).
Let us show that this is the solution. In effect. the ¯rst-order differential

zero for t·0 and for t>4t. In this case we obtain that the time-evolution of
the particle's density for 0<t·4t is a simple exponential function T(t)=e

Obviously, such an impact of the boson will temporarily accelerate/decelerate
this massive particle so that after this impact the particle will continue an in-
ertial propagation (by returning into its hydrostatic equilibrium again) but with
a different velocity vector of propagation. We recall [10] that, before the di-
rect collision (and successive absorption) of a massless boson with this massive
particle, also this boson transforms from the point-like particle into a massive
boson with a ¯nite 3-D region of its energy-density.

Let us consider a complete cycle of particle's auto-equilibrium dynamics when
a particle passes from an inertial propagation with a stationary distribution

to a small acceleration and consecutive energy-density spherical ex-
pansion, and then, after some interval of time, again returns into the inertial
stationary propagation:

T
(t) for t>4t becomes
negative (now with k >0)).
² Self-compression process: Let us now consider what happens for
t > 4t when the external ¯eld (which caused this short time spher-
ical perturbation) is equal to zero, so that the particle has to propa-
gate (after a very short time during which this particle reaches again
its hydrostatic equilibrium) again with a new constant velocity in the
vacuum. The energy-density distribution of the particle at t = 4t is
that given by (58). Consequently, we have that during the expansion for

So, we have now an inverse process, that is, a compression of the particle's
energy-density up to the radius r
0
when the distribution of the energy-
density again becomes time-invariant ©
m
(t;r) =
K
p
r
. Thus, we obtain
again a stationary particle's state in which internal forces become con-
stant in each point inside particle's body, and hence internal energy-°ow
velocity
¡ !
w =

u =u(t;r)e
r
becomes zero again. Thus, we return again to
particle's hydrostatic equilibrium
5
, as it was in the initial moment t = 0
before the particle's expansion caused by an acceleration, however now
with a different (but constant) speed of this particle.
Consequently, any particle's acceleration changes its internal energy-density
distribution which, as a side effect, generates the dynamic changes of inter-
nal forces in the particle's body and creates the internal density-°ux velocity
¡ !
u(t;
¡ !
r) (which is zero in the hydrostatic equilibrium during an inertial propa-
gation, making equal internal force in every point inside particle's body). The
self-gravitational forces, in the absence of the external ¯elds (that caused par-
ticle's acceleration), now generate again the stationary (stable) energy-density
distribution
K

inwhichthereisaperfectequilibriumofparticle'sinternalforces
(equal in each point inside particle's body). Consequently, the auto-stability of
any elementary massive particle is explained by this internal self-gravitational
process.

Notice that if we assume that t = 0 is the beginning of particle's perturba-
tion, so that for t · 0 it was in the hydrostatic equilibrium during an iner-
tial propagation (with a constant (group) velocity), then in (67) we have that

General Relativity theory of gravitation and time-space curvature where the
time-space is considered as a particular ¯eld. In effect, in GR time-space plays
a dual role in this theory, because it constitutes both the dynamical object
and the context within which the dynamics are de¯ned. This self-referential
aspect gives general relativity certain characteristics different from any other
¯eld theory. For example, in other theories we formulate a Cauchy initial value
problem by specifying the condition of the ¯eld everywhere at a given instant
t=0, and then use the ¯eld equations to determine the future evolution of the
¯eld. In contrast, because of the inherent self-referential quality of the metrical
¯eld, we are not free to specify arbitrary initial conditions. Also in our case, we

The simply connected matter distribution [10] at any ¯xed instance of time
t (the space where its matter/energy distribution in the 3-dimensional space-
like hypersurface §
t
½ M is greater than zero) means that every closed 3-
dimensional loop in it, such that for each point
¡ !
r 2 V
t
½ §
t
of this loop,
©(t;
¡ !
r)>0, can be deformed continuously to a small sphere. In fact, from the
Poincare conjecture (Grigorij Perelman, [2, 4, 3]):
"Every simply connected closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere",
we have the fact that in stationary cases when a massive particle propagates
with a constant speed (w.r.t. a given Minkowski frame), the natural topology
of particle's body-volume V
t
is a sphere with radius r
0
(with the spherically
symmetric energy-density distribution ©

proportional to
1
p
r
for the distance r
fromthebarycenter),likethetopologyofstarsinuniverse. Duringacceleration
this 'geometry' of V
t
changes, but with autocohesive forces when the particle
again returns in its inertial propagation, its 'geometry' again becomes perfectly
a sphere (3-D space symmetry).
The physical explanation of this 'implosion' process can be, for example, pro-
vided by using the Ricci °ow, de¯ned by Richard Hamilton [5], expressed by
the equation for this 3-D manifold V
t
,

where h

is the
component of the 3-D Ricci curvature tensor (considered in uni¯cation of
QM with Einstein's GR [11], Section 1.4, for the 4-D time-space pseudo-
Riemannian metric). Ricci °ow expands the negative curvature part of the
manifold and contracts the positive curvature part, as can be seen in Fig.1

, where we
can see an example of the evolution of the stable state (sphere) into unstable
particle's state, and vice versa.
However, in order to consider a kind of Richard Hamilton's Ricci °ow (as that
in equation (75)) we must ¯rst transform the "Newton's" equation (73) into
its covariant form (similarly to the method applied in [11]). More work in this
direction has to be done in the future.
In [10] has been considered the processes of spherical expansions and compres-
sions for the massless bosons, and explained how unstationary bosons can ob-
tainthepropertiesofthemassiveparticlesduringtheirinteractionwithanother
particles. Let us now consider the case of the self-compression process for the
unstable (massive) bosons. In this case the restriction of its 3-D energy density
©

is guided by self-gravitational forces and by using the Ricci °ow, expressed
by the equation (75) for this 3-D manifold V
t
, which reduces the energy-density
topology into an in¯nitesimal but ¯nite sphere with a radius r

The proof of Poincare conjecture built upon the program of Richard Hamilton to use the Ricci °ow to
attempt to solve the problem. In some cases Hamilton was able to show that this works; for example, if the
manifold has positive Ricci curvature everywhere he showed that the manifold becomes extinct in ¯nite time
underRicci°owwithoutanyothersingularities. (Inotherwords,themanifoldcollapsestoapointin¯nitetime;
itiseasytodescribethestructurejustbeforethemanifoldcollapses.) ThiseasilyimpliesthePoincareconjecture
in the case of positive Ricci curvature. However in general the Ricci °ow equations lead to singularities of the
metric after a ¯nite time. Perelman showed how to continue past these singularities: very roughly, he cuts the
manifold along the singularities, splitting the manifold into several pieces, and then continues with the Ricci
°ow on each of these pieces. This procedure is known as Ricci °ow with surgery.

The enough condition that the process of compression continues up to the
restriction into a single point (boson's barycenter) in 3-D is to avoid the gener-
ation of a micro black-hole, in the way that the energy-density is progressively
expelled from the 3-D into higher compacti¯ed dimensions [11]. It remains to
provide mathematically the details of such a physical process in the future re-
search.
Other important conclusion is that for the formal development of QM oper-
ators, in the conservative extension of current probabilistic/statistical theory
based fundamentaly on the SchrÄ odinger equation (and its extensions) valid for
the ensemble of identically prepared particles for a statistical measurements,
for an individual elementary particle, the only necessary new equation is the
conservation of rest-mass energy (4) (the conservation of matter for which the
rest-mass and rest-mass-energy are some of its fundamental properties), while
the other two equations (conservation laws of momentum and internal energy)
provided in Section 3, are useful only for the physical comprehension of the
self-equilibrium process inside the massive particles.
In effect, the momentum conservation law is useful only to explain the internal
dynamics of the density-°ow speed

nal forces generated by the self-gravity acceleration
¡ !
g(t;

static equilibrium we have that, in the particle's proper frame (with coordinate
centerinparticle'sbarycenter),

u(t;
¡ !
r)=0,andtheparticle'sdensityisspher-
ically symmetric and proportional to
K
p
r
, so that the internal force is constant
and equal in every point inside particle's body.
The internal energy law is useful also to consider the behavior of a massive
particle with the rest mass m
0
and momentum p in a number of extreme per-
turbations and also in the cases of the so called virtual particles (when tem-
porary is not valid the equation for particles total energy E, that is, when
