Abstract
In this work, we study the existence of positive periodic solutions for two types of
third-order nonlinear neutral differential equations with variable coe cients. The results
are established by using the Krasnoselskii's  xed point theorem. The results obtained here
extend the work of Ren, Siegmund and Chen [30]. Two examples are given to illustrate
this work.

1 Introduction
Third order differential equations arise from in a variety of different areas of
applied mathematics and physics, as the deection of a curved beam having aDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2018
constant or varying cross section, three layer beam, electromagnetic waves or
gravity driven ows and so on [2, 16, 23, 28, 30].
Delay differential equations have received increasing attention during recent
years since these equations have been proved to be valuable tools in the mod-
eling of many phenomena in various  elds of science and engineering, see the
monograph [10, 24] and the papers [1]-[6], [9], [11]-[22], [26]-[28], [30], [32], [33],
[35], [36] and the references therein.
Ren, Siegmund and Chen [30] discussed the existence of positive!-periodic
solutions for the following neutral functional differential equation
(x(t) cx(t  (t)))
000
= a(t)x(t) +f(t;x(t  (t)));
wherejcj < 1. By employing Krasnoselskii's  xed point theorem, the authors
obtained existence results for positive !-periodic solutions.
In the present article, we study the existence of positive!-periodic solutions
for the following two types of third-order nonlinear neutral differential equations
(x(t) c(t)x(t  ))
000
=a(t)x(t) f(t;x(t  )); (1)
and
(x(t) c(t)x(t  ))
000
= a(t)x(t) +f(t;x(t  )); (2)
where c2 C(R;R); a2 C(R; (0;1)); f2 C(R R;R);  ;! > 0, and c, a are
!-periodic functions,f is!-periodic with respect to  rst variable. To show the
existence of positive !-periodic solutions, we transform (1) and (2) into inte-
gral equations and then use Krasnoselskii's  xed point theorem. The obtained
integral equations split in the sum of two mappings, one is a contraction and
the other is compact.
In this paper, we have two main contributions comparing with the existing
results. First, instead of constant c we take variable coe cient c(t). Second,
in addition tojc(t)j < 1, we consider the rangejc(t)j > 1 for c(t), which is
new in the literature. Also, the results obtained here extend the work of Ren,
Siegmund and Chen [30].
The organization of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we introduce
some notations and lemmas, and state some preliminary results needed in later
sections. Then we give the Green's function of (1) and (2) which plays an
important role in this paper. Also, we present the inversions of (1) and (2), and
Krasnoselskii's  xed point theorem. For details on Krasnoselskii's theorem we
refer the reader to [7, 8, 25, 29, 31, 34]. In section 3, we present our main results

on existence of positive !-periodic solutions of (1) and (2). Two examples are
also given to illustrate this work.

Lastly in this section, we state Krasnoselskii's  xed point theorem which
enables us to prove the existence of positive!-periodic solutions to (1) and (2).
For its proof we refer the reader to [25, 31, 34].
Lemma 7 (Krasnoselskii [25, 31, 34]) Let D be a closed convex nonempty
subset of a Banach space (B;k k). Suppose that A and B map D intoB such
that
(i) Ax +By2D; 8x;y2D,
(ii) A is completely continuous,
(iii) B is a contraction mapping.
Then there exists z2D with z =Az +Bz.
3 Positive periodic solutions
To apply Lemma 7, we need to de ne a Banach space B, a closed con-
vex subset D ofB and construct two mappings, one is contraction and the
other is a completely continuous. So we let (B;k k) = (C
!
;k k) and D =

3.1 Positive periodic solutions in the casejc(t)j> 1
In this subsection, we obtain the existence of positive !-periodic solution for
(1) and (2) by considering the two cases: 1 <c(t) <1 and 1 <c(t) < 1
for all t2 [0;!].

3.2 Positive periodic solutions in the casejc(t)j< 1
In this subsection, we obtain the existence of a positive periodic solution for
(1) and (2) by considering the three cases; 0 < c(t) < 1, 1 < c(t)  0 and
c(t) = 0 for all t2 [0;!].
