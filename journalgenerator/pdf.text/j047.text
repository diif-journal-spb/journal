NONLINEAR BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS
DESCRIBING MOBILE CARRIER TRANSPORT IN
SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES
E.Z.Borevich, V.M.Chistyakov
Abstract.
The present paper describes mobile carrier transport in semiconductor de-
vices with constant densities of ionized impurities. For this purpose we use
one-dimensional system of partial differential equations.The work considers the
proofs of: global existence of solutions of systems of such kind, their bifurcations
and their stability under corresponding assumptions.
Key words: Nonlinear boundary value problem, asymptotic behaviour of
solutions, semiconductors, carrier transport, constant densities of ionized im-
purities, interior transition layer phenomena.
Classiﬁcation: 35Q20, 35D05, 35B40.

Here the constant f > 0 represents a homogeneons density of ionized impu-
rutues, D(|E|) is the diffusion coeﬃcient, j

is the electron currien density for
x = 0. For sake of deﬁniteness we shall presumeE

j

Under such conditions the problem (1)–(3) has a trivial solution E(x) =

k = 1,2,..., in the neighborhood of which appear small bifurcational solutions
of the problem (1)–(3) [1]. In this paper we prove that the conditionK(E
0
)< 0
implies that the diffusion coeﬃcient D as a function of ﬁeldstrength has N–
shaped form and contains an interval (E
1
,E

), in which this function has a
negative derivative andD(E

)+E

D
0
(E
0
)< 0, i.e. so called condition of nega-
tive differential conductivity (NDC) is valid. In section 1 we prove that NDC–
condition is necessary and suﬃcient for the existance of bifurcational solutions
of the problem (1)–(3). Then in section 2 the extendability of all bifurcational
solutions on the parameterf is demonstrated. The corresponding bifurcational
problem can be considered as an eigenvalue nonlinear problem; in section 3
we discuss forms of eigenfunctions of this problem. It appears that asymptotic
behavior of bifurcational solutions under large values of parameter f depends
essentially on the parameter E
0
. In section 4 we prove that a unique point E
∗
0
exists on the interval (E
1
,E
2
) such that there arise so called interior transition
layer phenomena [2,3] in the problem (1)–(3). If E
0
∈ (E
1
,E
2
), but E
0
6= E
∗
0
,
then asymptotic behavior of bifurcational solutions has a completely different
nature. In section 5 the existence and uniqueness of solutions of nonstationary
initial–boundaru value problem for (1)–(3 for everyt> 0 is discussed; this the-
ory is applied to investigate stability and instability of bifurcational solutions.
It appears that the stability of the ﬁrst (positive ) and the second (negative )
eigenfunctions depends also on the parameterE
0
. In section 6 ti is proved that:
Electronic Journal.  66Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 1999
if E
0
= E
∗
0
, then the pair eigenfunctions are stabile; if E
1
< E
0
< E
∗
0
, then
only the negative function is stable, and if E
∗
0
< E
0
< E
2
or vise versa, only
positive one is stable. Other eigenfunctions are unstabile for any E
0
∈ (E
1
,E
2
)
for those values of the parameter f for which they exist. In the last section
7 the existence of parabolic travelling wave for E
0
= E
∗
0
and its stability for
suﬃciently large f are proved.

2) D(y) has a unique local maximum and a unique point of inﬂection for

Let E(x) = E

Proposition 2.1 If the inequality f <

on [0,1]. We shall consider the problem (5) as a nonlinear eigenvalues problem:

Let us analyse for which values of the parameter E
0
nontrivial solutions of
problem (4) exist.
Proposition 2.3 If 0<E
0
≤E
max
or E
0
≥E
min
thenthe problem (4) has
only trivial solution E(x) =E
0
. If E
0
∈ (E
max
,E
min
) then the problem (4) has
nontrivial (bifurcaational) solutions.
If E
0
∈ (E
max
,E
min
), then G
0
(E
0
) < 0, i.e. K(E
0
) < 0 and from theorem
1.1 the problem (4) has nontrivial solution. If 0 < E
0
≤ E
max
or E
0
≥ E
min
then K(E
0
) ≥ 0. Let us consider the problem (7). Further we prove that if
K(E
0
) ≥ 0 then thia problem has no small nontrivial solutions; from this and
from Rabinowitz’s results (see theorem 2.3 [6]) it follows that the problem (7)
can not have any nontrivial solutions. The problem (7) can be linearized in the
neighbourhood of a zero-solution
Lu =−fK(E
0
)u;
u(0) =u(1) = 0.
Since the last form of the problem has only a zero-solution, then the problem
(7) has no nontrivial solutions .
3. Extendability of bifurcational solutions on
parameter f
We show in this section that every bifurcational solution is extendable on the
parameter f > f
k
, where f

prove the following proposition.
Proposition 3.1 Let E
0
∈ (E
max
,E
min
). Then there exists such a positive
continius fuiction ϕ(f): R
+
→ R
+
, that for any solution (u,f) of the problem
(7) the inequality:
kuk
X
(f)≤ϕ(f) (8)
Electronic Journal.  69Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 1999
is fulﬁlled.
Proof. From the form of differential equation and the inequality (6) we
have an estimate

, (9)
This estimate gives an analogous estimate in the normC

([0,1]). The estimate
of u

(x) is based on (7) and inequalities (6) and (9). As a result we have

in the norm C
(1)
([0,1]). To estimate the uniform norm of u
00
(x) the equation
(7) can be used; it gives the estimate (8).
Now return to the problem (7). If E
0
∈ (E
max
,E
min
), then form the propo-
sition
a) of Theorem 1.1 and proposition 3.1 it follows that the bifurcational so-
lutions which were obtained in the proposition
b) of theorem 1.1 are extendable on the parametr f for any f > f
k
, k =
1,2,...
To synthesize these results we denoteU
+
k
to be set ofu(x)∈X, which have
(k +1) simple zeros and sign
x→0+0
u(x) = 1; let U
−
k
=−U

k
, k∈N.
Theorem3.1GivenE
0
∈ (E

,E

). Then for everyk∈N, everyν = +
or − and for every f > f
k
there exists at least one solution u(x) of boundary
value problem (7) such that u∈U
ν
k
.
In further text the functionsu
ν
k
(x)∈U
ν
k
will be called eigenfunctions of the
nonlinear operator of the problem (7).
4. Forms of eigenfunctions.
To investigate the forms of these eigenfunctions let the problem (4) be refor-
mulated as:
−E
00
−E
0
E =f(G(E
0
)−G(E))D
−1
(|E|),
E(0) =E(1) =E
0
.
(10)
If E
0
∈ (E
max
,E
min
) and (f,E) is a nontrivial solution of the problem (10)
the for each x ∈ [0,1] the inequality E
1
(E
0
) < E(x) < E
2
(E
0
) is fulﬁlled. In
Electronic Journal.  70Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 1999
this inequality E
i
(E
0
) (i = 1,2) is the solution of the equation H(E,E
0
) = 0,
which was mentioned in the proposition 2.2, i = 1,2. This result follows from
the fast that constants E
0
, E
1
(E
0
) and E
2
(E
0
) are the solutions of differential
equation (10).
The solutions E(x) of the problem (10) will be called a positive one if a
corresponding function u(x) =E(x)−E
0
is positive on (0,1).
Let E(x) be the positive solution of the problem (10). Let us prove that
E(x) has only one maximum. If it is not so then there exists such x
0
∈ (0,1)
that E(x
0
) is a localminimum. However that given
0≥−E
00
(x
0
) =f(G(E
0
)−G(E(x
0
)))D
−1
(E(x
0
))> 0,
wich is impossible.
Theorem 2.1 shows that each solution from S
k
has (k + 1) simple zeros
on[0,1]; similar reasoning gives next result.
Proposition 4.1 Let E(x) = u(x)+E
0
be such a solution of the boudary
value problem (10) that (f,u)∈S
k
, k = 1,2,.... Then:
a) if k = 2n, then E(x) has n maxima and n minimuma;
b) if k = 2n+1 then the numbers of minima and maxima differ by 1.
5. Asymptotic behaviour of the eigenfunctions for large
values of parameter f
The case of large concentrations of ionized impurities is of gread interest for
physical application. Mathematically this fact can be associated with asymp-
totical behaviour of the eigenfunctions for large values of parameterf. Let the
problem (4) be formulatrd as:
εE
00
+εE
0
E =H(E,E
0
),
E(0) =E(1) =E

(11)
where ε =f

) =E−E

Let u

k = 1,2,..., ν = +,−. Then E

(x,ε) = u

are the solutions of
the problem (11), which are deﬁned for 0 < ε < ε

, where ε

k
. We shall
call these the eigenfunctions of the problem (11). Let E

), i = 1,2 be two positive solutions of the equation H(E,E

The asymptotic behaviour of the eigenfunctions of the problem (11) sharply
changes when E

. In this case the families of solutions have interior
transition points.
Deﬁnition 5.1 [2]. Let E(x,ε) be the famili of solutions for the problem

Theorem 5.3 states that there exists a family of solutions of the problem
(11) with an arbitrary large number of transition points of such solutions.

(x,ε) has exactly k−1 transition points on the interval (0,1).
The proves of these theorems follow from some results of R.O’Malley [7].
It appears that the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions of the problem (11)
depends essentially on the properties of such differential equations as
¨ y +

¨ u−H(u,E

Proof. We shall use the results of P.Fife [3]. The equation εE

The properties c) and d) of proposition 2.2 are equvalent to the fast that the

Let us return to the proof of 5.1. It is raiher easy to prove that the rest point
(E
0
,0) is a stable focus for suﬃciently small ε> 0. By C
ε
we detnote a closed
loop which circles the point (E
0
,0), coming out from the point (E

(E

returningt

it. Then there exists the trajectoryy(t,ε) within the domain which
is formed by the loop C
ε
; this trajectory has properties: ω(y(t,ε)) = (E
0
,0),
α(y(t,ε)) =C
ε
, where α(y) and ω(y) are α–limit set and ω–limit set of y(t,ε)
[8]. Consider an arbitrary solution E(x,ε) of the problem (11). The function
y(t,ε) is a solution for the boundary value problem

Sinceα(y(t,ε)) =C
ε

(E

(E

point with a separatrix C
ε
then theorem 5.1 can be obtained by the reasoning
used in the 5–th proposition of R.’Malley’s theorem [7]. Proof of theorem 5.2
completely repeats that of theorem 5.1.
The closed loop C
ε
is an α-limit set for any solution of the problem (18).
When E

C

has two saddle points (E

(E

and the 4-th proposition of ’Malley’s theorem [7] give theorem 5.3.
6. Nonstationary initial-boundary value problem. Exis-

the conditions of theorems 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 [8] are fulﬁlled. To this end it is
suﬃciently to prove that

2) F is Lipschitzian locally.
Using the theorems 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 [8] we can formulate the following propo-
sition.
Proposition 6.1 A unique solution u(x,t) of Cauchi problem (20) exists
on some maximal interval 0≤t≤
¯
t.Moreover this solution exists for any initial
condition and either
¯
t = +∞ or ku(x,t)k
H

→ +∞ for t→
¯
t.
To prove the following proposition we need the theorem 3.5.2. [8] on a
smoothing differential operator.
Proposition 6.2 The solution u(x,t) of the nonstationary problem (20) is
a classical solution.
Proof. u(t;u
0
) ∈ D(A) for t > 0. The function t 7→
du
dt
∈ ∈ H
1
0
(0,1) is
G¨ olderian locally (see the theorem 3.5.2 [8]). There fore the function
(x,t)7→u(x,t;u
0
),
∂u
∂t
(x,t;u

)
are continions for t
0
< t <

t and x ∈ [0,1]. Since u ∈ D(A), then u
0
∈
W

2
(0,1) ⊂ C(0,1). There exists some δ > 0 that F(u) ∈ C
δ
(0,1) u(·,t) ∈
C
2+δ
(0,1). Thus, when t > 0 the function (x,t) 7→ u(x,t;u
0
) is continiously
differentiable by t and twice continiouslu differentiable by x; therefore it is a
classical solution of the (20).
The main item of this section is the following proposition which based on
the concept of the dynamical system for parabolic equations [8].

Proof. First consider the fact that the solution u(x,t) of the problem (20)
with the initial condition u
0
∈ C can not leave the set C on the interval of
its existence. For this we use a version of the maximum principle. Let t
1
be a
minimal value t
1
∈ (0,
¯
t), so that the solution u(x,t
1
) of the problem (20) has
a local maximum. σ = u(x

), where x

∈ (0,1) and σ > σ

(E

(x

) = 0,
∂

u

(x

) ≤ 0. Then from the differential equation (20) we
obtain that since (−h(σ,E
0
))< 0 then ˙ u(x
1
,t
1
)< 0.
Furthermore, the solution u(x,t) of the problem (20) can not have a local
minimum, which value is less thanσ
1
(E

)< 0 ( a proof is quite similar). Prove
that the solution of (20) exists for anyt≥ 0. Let it be not so. Then proposition
6.1 gives that

7. Stability and instability of eigenfunctions
This section deals with stability of solutions for the stationary problem (4)
by the linear approximetion. For this aim we need two theorems ( 5.1.1 and
5.1.3) from [8], which give suﬃcient conditions of stability and instability of
such solutions. Let E
ν
k
(x,ε) be the solutions of the problem (11) from section
4 deﬁned for suﬃcienly small ε, ν = +,−; k = 1,2,... Two following theorems
form the main subject of this section.
Theorem 7.1
1) If E
max
< E
0
< E
∗
0
, then the solution E
−
1
(x,ε) of the problem (11) is
stable for suﬃciently small ε;
2) if E
∗
0
< E
0
< E
min
, then the solution E
+
1
(x,ε) of the problem (11) is
stable for suﬃciently small ε;
3) if E
0
= E
∗
0
, then both solutions E
±
1
(x,ε) of the problem (11) are stable
for suﬃciently small ε;
Theorem 7.2 The solution E
±
k
(x,ε) are unstable for E
±
k
(x,ε), for every
E
0
∈ (E
max
,E
min
) and for each k = 2,3,....
Remark. Theorem 7.1 states thates that the solutions are stable only for
suﬃciently small ε > 0. Apparently this fact is assignable; it is quite possible
that the solutions E
±
1
(x,ε) can be unstable when ε is not small.
Proves of Theorems 6.1 and 6.2 must be preceeded by rather spacious
preambula. First discuss the case where E

Proof. For the proof it is suﬃcient to show that there exists a constant c
independent of ε, shuch that for any continuous function F with |F|
0
≤ 1 and
for any suﬃciently small ε> 0 there exists solution u

satisfying |u

≤ c. This can be done by constructing supersolutions u

and
subsolutions u

. For this supersolution the conditions L
ε
u

≤ F, u
ε
≥ 0,
u

for the subsolution. If the positive supersolution can be constructed, then we
merely take |u

. By a theorem of Nagumo [9], there exists an ex-
act solution (22) with |u

for suﬃciently large f, there exists a solution of (25) such that ϕ(s)→E

Theorem 4.1 [3] states that for suﬃciently small ε the equition (26) has a
solution y(τ,ε) such that y(τ,ε)→E

traveling wave. Suppose that there exists a solution ϕ(x)
ϕ

shuch that ϕ(x) → α for x → −∞, ϕ(x) → β for x → +∞ f(u,p) ∈ C

f(α,0) =f(β,0) = 0. The linearized problem of ϕ is

limits of these functions for x→±∞. Denote by σ

(L) the essential spectrum
of operator L [8].
Proposition8.1([8]) The essential spectrumσ

if and only ifb

points.
Proposition8.2([8]) If the solutionϕ(x) connects two saddle points, then
the solution ϕ(x) is stabile.
Since E

(E

) are saddle points, then proposition 8.1 and proposi-
tion 8.2 state that for suﬃciently small ε the solution y(τ,ε) of the equation
(26) connects two saddle points. The exercise 6 in§ 5.1 [8] gives the result that
the solutionE(x,t) expotentially approximatesϕ by norm inϕ Δ Ωff¬Ξ ﬁff ΩΔ

stability of the parabolic traveling wave for suﬃciently largef and for arbitrary
