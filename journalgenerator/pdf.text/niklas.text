Abstract.
R. V. Bekryaev derived a system for a horizontally baroclinic atmosphere con-
sisting of six ordinary differential equations. We prove dissipativity and ﬁnd
estimates for the location of the global attractor. The evolution of a compli-
cated attractor is analysed with a Poincar´ e map showing diﬃcult bifurcation
behaviour. Investigations in bifurcation diagrams show a rich dynamical be-
haviourincludinga lotof knowncomplicatedbifurcations,of which a fold-Hopf
bifurcation is examined in detail. Finally, we give some theory about the Lya-
punov spectra and present a method for determining the exponents.Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2005
1 Introduction
The equations for atmospheric ﬂow are one of the most studied dynamical
systems of the last century. Both their practical importance and their mathe-
matical richness have attracted much attention. R. V. Bekryaev at the Arctic
and Antarctic Research Institute of Saint Petersburg derived a model for a
horizontally baroclinic atmosphere. In the derivation of the system a mean
approximation of the atmosphere was used, this means that the atmosphere
was treated as a thin layer at some height above the surface of the Earth. The
Navier-Stokes equation, the equation for heat conduction, the continuity equa-
tion and a Galerkin procedure were then used to obtain the continuous system
consisting of six ordinary quadratic differential equations given by

where Pe is the Pecle number. This system was found by Edward N. Lorenz in
1963, see [3]. In 1984 Lorenz published a modiﬁcation of his system, referred
to as the Lorenz-84 model, see [4]. This system has been of great interest for
mathematicians and yields

where a and b are parameters. In a later paper [5], Lorenz pointed out that F
and G should be allowed to vary periodically, and in 2002, H. Broer, C. Sim´ o
and R. Vitolo published an article [6] where they examined this system for
F →F(1+ǫcos(ωt))
G→G(1+ǫcos(ωt))
ExceptfortheBekryaevsystem, thereis anothersix-dimensionalsystemexam-
inedbyL.VanVeen[7]in2003,withquiteanalogousbehaviourastheBekryaev
system. For example, both systems give rise to fold-Hopf bifurcations and the
dynamics seems to take place on three-dimensionalinvariant manifolds in both
systems. Also, L. Van Veen found a reduction of his six-dimensional system to
the Lorenz-84 model. It is interesting that all of these systems have so much in
common, even if they represent different models.

the Bekryaev system (1) is dissipative by ﬁnding a suitable Lyapunov function.

After this proof, seven of the parameters are given values found in [1], and
are from now on ﬁxed when the system is investigated by changing the three
parameters A, B and Q
F
. The values are
Be =−8.5242, C = 0, P = 16/5, Pr = 1 (2)
Q
Y
= 0, U
T
= 620.15, U
U
= 42.467
Estimates for the bounds of the global attractor are found for various values of
the parameter Q
F
for the case when A = 2 and B = 0.
In Section 3 one attains knowledge about some non-wandering sets that
occur when changing Q
F
for A = 2 and B = 0. The system is simulated using
a Runge-Kutta method programmed in C-code. A complicated attractor that
arises close to a fold bifurcation is discussed and analysed using a Poincar´ e
map, showing diﬃcult bifurcation behaviour. The Lyapunov spectrum is also
determined for this attractor at different values of Q
F
and compared to the
results from the Poincar´ e map.
Bifurcations in the plane of the parameters A and B will be analysed in
Section 4 using the software package AUTO 97, which can be found on the in-
ternet at [8]. The fold and Hopf bifurcation curves found in the AB-plane and
different regions and their corresponding set of equilibria are discussed. Two
bifurcations of codimension two are discovered, the Bogdanov-Takens and the
fold-Hopf bifurcation. The fold-Hopf bifurcation will be studied in more detail.
An approximationof the locally deﬁned three-dimensional center manifold will
be found and the system is transformed into a normal form for fold-Hopf bi-
furcations derived in [10], from which the behaviour near the bifurcation can
be analysed. Some of the results are then veriﬁed by further simulations with
AUTO.Intheendofthesectionsomeattractorsareshown,oneofwhichshows
an invariant torus.
The deﬁnition of the Lyapunov spectrum and some facts about the expo-
nents can be found in Section 5, and a method for computing the spectrum
is presented in which one augment the dynamical system with an orthonormal
frame and a Lyapunov vector. The implementation is also described and some
results are shown.

2 Dissipativity
In this section dissipativity will be proved for the Bekryaev system (1). Before
giving the deﬁnition of dissipativity,we introduce the evolutionoperator which
determines the state x
t
of a system at time t, provided the initial state x
0
is
known. Assume that for each t > 0 a single-valued map ϕ
t
is deﬁned in the
phase space X,
ϕ
t
: X →X
which transforms an initial statex
0
∈X into some statex
t
∈X at time t > 0
given by
x
t
= ϕ
t
x
0
We are now ready to give the following deﬁnition
Deﬁnition 2.1 An n-dimensional dynamical system is said to be dissipative if
there exists a bounded region S ∈ R
n
such that ∀x
0
∈ R
n
∃t
0
> 0 such that
∀t >t
0
, ϕ
t
x
0
∈S.
In words, the above deﬁnition means that, in a dissipative dynamical system
there exists a region such that all trajectoriesenter this region after suﬃciently
long time, and nothing can escape from this region. This means that if we can
prove dissipativity, we have proved the existence of a global attractor. It is
therefore of great interest knowing if a dynamical system is dissipative or not.
2.1 Proof of dissipativity
The dissipativity of the Bekryaev system is given by the following.
Theorem 2.1 The Bekryaev system (1) is dissipative.
Electronic Journal.  5Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2005
Proof
The idea of the proof is to ﬁnd a proper Lyapunov function V, and then prove
that it is possible to take a constant Γ such that all regions where V is in-
creasing in time are totally contained in the ellipsoid formed by V = Γ. This
means that outside the ellipsoid V = Γ the Lyapunov function V is decreasing,
and therefore, trajectories outside V = Γ tend inward this ellipsoid. Due to
symmetries in the Bekryaev system (1), we get rid of some improper terms in
the time derivative by considering as Lyapunov function

Clearly, expression (7) is a quadratic form only in the variables F,Y and Z.
Further, outside of the sphere V
′
FYZ
= 0, we haveV
′
FYZ
< 0 due to the negative
signs of the second order terms. This means that we can take a constant Γ
1
suchthatoutsidethesphereV
FYZ

thefunctionV
FYZ
isdecreasingintime.
This means that we have shown dissipativity in theFYZ-subspace.
Observethatalltermsin(5)involveoneofthevariablesF,Y orZ. There-
fore, due to the dissipativityin theFYZ-subspace, bounds for the cross terms
can be found by replacing F,Y and Z by suﬃciently large constants, say
F
max
,Y
max
and Z
max
such that
|F | ≤ F
max
|Y | ≤ Y
max
|Z | ≤ Z
max
From this and the triangleinequalitywe can ﬁnd a bound for expression (5) by
writing
V

Thus, V
′
cross
is less than a function including only linear terms, and it follows
that the derivative V
′
given by (4) becomes negative far away from the origin.
Therefore, it is possible to take a constant Γ such that all regions where the
Lyapunov function given by (3) is increasing in time are totally contained in
the ellipsoidgivenby the levelsurfaceV = Γ, and we have provedthe theorem.

are ﬁxed to the values given in (2). This case was studied by Bekryaev in [1]
and willbe analysed furtherin Section 3. By givingQ
F
a value, we willbe able
to determine the smallest possible value of the constant Γ deﬁned in Section
2.1, say Γ
s
, giving the smallest boundary of the global attractor. To do so,
consider the derivative with respect to time τ of the Lyapunov function given
by (3). In this case it takes the simpler form

(8)
Expression (8) is negative outside the ellipsoid V
′
= 0. In order to ﬁnd Γ
s
,
we will determine a point on both surfaces, that is, the ellipsoids V
′
= 0 and
V = Γ
s
, of which the corresponding normals ˆ n
V
and ˆ n
V
′ are parallel. From
this we have the equations
ˆ n
V
=αˆ n
V
′ α > 0
V = Γ

(9)
V
′
= 0
where the normals to the level surfaces can be calculated from
ˆ n
V
=±∇V and ˆ n
V
′ =±∇V
′
The ﬁrst equation in (9) is six-dimensional, and since we have eight unknown,
this is enough for ﬁnding solutions with the software package MAPLE. In this
case however, we obtained three real solutions, which is natural because the
ellipsoids may touch several times with parallel normals when Γ
s
is increased
from zero. But, choosing the solution that gives the largest Γ
s
ensures that the
ellipsoid V
′
= 0 is totally contained in the ellipsoid V = Γ
s
. To illustrate the
result, we look for the maximum value each of the variablesX,G,H,F,Y,Z
can attain on the global attractor. From the Lyapunov function (3) we ﬁnd
by setting all except one variable equal to zero the following bounds for the
variables

A = 2 and B = 0, the rest of the parameter values are given in (2). In Section

for the bounds of this attractor were found especially for this case, see Section

3.1 Finding equilibria
In this section we will ﬁnd equilibria to system (10) by solving the equations
obtainedbyrequiringthederivativestobe zero. ThesoftwarepackageMAPLE
was used in order to accomplish the following calculations. Unfortunately, the
package was not able to solve the system of equations immediately, therefore
symmetries in the system were used to make simpliﬁcations. By taking the
following linear combinations

Unfortunately,we cannot withthis method showthat these three equilibriaare
the only existing ones.

changes, this unstable equilibrium has four contracting directions and no
bifurcation occurs. The two other equilibria, F
1
and F

are created in a fold
bifurcation at Q
F
= 200. For large Q
F
values we have the stable limit cycle P
as an attracting set, the cycle is shown for Q
F
= 300 in ﬁgure 5; Section 3.3.
This cycle loses stability in a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation at Q
F
= 185, and
disappears in a subcritical Hopf bifurcation for Q
F
= 172 at equilibrium F

F

the number of contracting directions changes from ﬁve to three in the sub-
critical Hopf bifurcation at Q

F
= −10.3 we have a
fold bifurcation where two more equilibria, one stable (F

(F

, there are three equilibria in the interval
−61.0 < Q
F
< −10.3. In this interval the stable equilibrium F

b loses two
contracting directions in a subcritical Hopf bifurcation at Q
F
= −28.6, where
also an unstable cycle is created. Further, the branches F

disappear in another fold bifurcation at Q

A more complicated attractor (CA) occurs when F

furcation at Q
F
= −50,7. Figure 6 shows this attractor for Q
F

Z-coordinate for the ﬁve different parameter values Q
F
=−300,−450,
−650,−1000 and Q
F
=−2500 is shown in ﬁgure 7 to give an overview of how
the attractor changes with the parameter. For Q
F
= −300, the attractor CA
clearly shows one repeating laminar and one repeating more complicated part.
In fact, the laminar part becomes longer by increasing the parameter until we
have the stable equilibrium. In order to explain this behaviour, consider the
following. Figure 8 illustratesthe location of the attractingset forQ
F
=−50.7
and Q
F
= −51.0. In the ﬁrst case, trajectories are attracted by the stable
equilibrium F
2
a, and in the latter, we have the attractor CA. In ﬁgure 8 one

corresponding to the eigenvalue which is zero in the fold bifurcation where F

disappears. By comparing this eigenvector to the direction of trajectories in
the laminarpartofCA forQ

the behaviour of the more complicated parts of the attractor CA remains for
some parameter values larger than Q
F

a starting point at each side of equilibrium F

b, (which has ﬁve contracting
directions, cf table 3.1) in the repelling direction. From both starting points,
the trajectory arrives F

3.4.1 Construction of the Poincar´ e map
Consider a ﬁve-dimensional plane nearly orthogonalto the direction of the tra-
jectory when it passes the middle of the laminar part of the attractor CA at
Q
F
= −51.0. The Poincar´ e map P
Q
F
will be deﬁned by this plane, and when
investigating periodicity in the laminar part, we also need another condition
Electronic Journal.  17Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2005
for P
Q
F
, namely, that trajectories cross the plane almost perpendicular. This
is to avoid all intersections from other parts of CA. With this deﬁnition of the
Poincar´ e map, it is clearly not well deﬁned for all Q
F
values, because the be-
haviour of the laminar part changes with Q
F
, but it is enough for investigating
the attractor to approximately Q
F
=−400.
To ﬁnd the plane, new coordinates (x,g,h,f,y,z) are introduced such that
system (10) has, in these coordinates, the stable equilibrium F
2
a at the origin
for Q
F
=−50.7. We now have system (10) written in the form
˙ x = κ(x), x∈R
6
(11)
where κ forms the right hand side of the equations and κ(0) = 0. In the next
step, system (11) is transformed into the eigenbasis to the Jacobian matrix for
F
2
a at Q
F
= −50.7. This is done using diagonalization in the following way.
Let e
1
,...,e
6
denote the set of eigenvectors to the Jacobian matrix, where
e
1
is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue which is zero at the fold
bifurcation where F
2
a disappears. Then we put
P = [e
1
,...,e
6
] and x = [x,g,h,f,y,z]
T
Now, new coordinatesu = [a,b,c,d,k,l]
T
are deﬁned by
x =Pu
System (11) can now be transformed intou coordinates by
P ˙ u =κ(Pu)
giving
˙ u=P
−1
κ(Pu) (12)
In system (12), variable a corresponds to the direction of the eigenvector e
1
,
therefore, a will change quite fast during the laminar part of CA, where the
rest of the variables, b,c,d,k,l will stay almost constant. The ﬁve-dimensional
plane seeked for can now be found as a= 0.

3.4.2 Implementation and results
To see when a trajectory crosses the plane a = 0, we check if
a

≤ 0, i = 1,2,3,... (13)
whereisymbolizesthenumberofstepstakenbytheC-programme. Inwords,it
is checked if the variable a has changed sign after every iteration. To constrain
P

F
to intersections only from the laminar part, we deﬁne the norm N

in the
variables b,c,d,k,l by

Further, let the difference ΔN

be given by
ΔN

−N
i−1
We demand that ΔN
i
is bounded by a suﬃciently small number ǫ, that is
ΔN
i
<ǫ (14)
By testing, we found a proper value of ǫ, giving only the intersections from the
laminar part of CA. If (13) and (14) simultaneously hold after iteration i, the
program checks if
a
i
<δ or a
i−1
< δ (15)
where δ is a suﬃciently small number determining the accuracy. If (15) does
not hold, the programmereverses one iterationand takes half the step size and
so on, until (15) is satisﬁed.
We show the result of 350 implementations for the parameter values Q
F
=
−51,−52,...,−400. Bycomparingthetimeτ atdifferentintersectionswiththe
plane, we found the proper value ǫ = 0.001. Further, the accuracy parameter

ter value, which means that the whole simulation needed about 100 hours. For
Q
F
= −51,−52,...,−296, we have a ﬁxed point in the Poincar´ e map, which
means that the laminar part of CA occurs periodically with periodicity one.
When the parameter decreases further, the attractor jumps between different
periodicitiesandmorecomplicatedbehaviourduetounknownbifurcations. An
overview of this behaviour is illustrated in ﬁgure 9, which shows the results for

indicate the location of periodic cycles with periodicity two, and the broken
line indicates a periodic cycle having periodicity four.

One can see that system (16) is symmetric in such a way that the substitution

leavesitinvariant. Thismeansthatweonlyneedtoconsidervariationsinsome
values of the parameters A and B to understand the parameter plane.
4.1 The 20 regions
From Section 3 we know that system (16) has three equilibria for A = 2 and
B = 0. The software package AUTO was used in order to follow these equi-
libria under variations in the free parameters A and B. By doing this, several
bifurcations occurred that could be followed by the program in order to ﬁnd
the corresponding bifurcation curves in the plane of the parameters A and B.
This analysis contains the fold and Hopf bifurcations, limit cycles are not anal-
ysed with exception of the fold-Hopf case studied in Section 4.2, however,some

Theory about fold and Hopf bifurcations can be found in [9], [10] and [11].

stable limit cycles that occur will be illustrated in Section 4.3. Figure 14 and

Figure 13: Overview in an unreal scale of the bifurcation diagram in the AB-plane. The Roman
numerals symbolize the number of equilibria existing in each region. Solid curves indicate fold
bifurcations and broken curves indicate Hopf bifurcations.
The bifurcation diagram will be described from ﬁgure 13, but we will also refer
to the real bifurcation diagram illustrated in ﬁgure 14 - 17. One need to men-
tion that nothing ensures that all existing equilibria and bifurcations are found
in this analysis.

ing f

from region I

Thus, in region III

and III

, we have three equilibria, two stable and one
unstable. Moreover,close to the fold bifurcationcurvef

cation curve marked h

increasefromthreetoﬁve,andsimultaneouslyanunstablelimitcycleiscreated.
From the fact that the stable equilibrium in region I

due to the Hopf bifurcation at the curve h

, we ﬁnd that in
region III

respectively.
Thus, there are one stable and four unstable equilibria in this region. In region

, we have the same set of equilibria as in region III
b
, that is, one stable
and two unstable ones.
For the parameter values A = 0.23114, B = −0.023035, the Hopf bifurca-
tion curve h

collides with the fold bifurcationcurvef

and disappears. At this
point,wehavetwozeroeigenvalueswhichmeansaBogdanov-Takens(fold-fold)

bifurcation. Moreover, the fold curves f

and
the Hopf curve h

intersect at A = 1.2426, B = −0.016664. Here we have
one zero and a pair of pure imaginary eigenvalues which means a fold-Hopf
bifurcation (marked F-H in the ﬁgures). Figure 17 shows the location of this
bifurcation, which will be investigated further in Section 4.2. On the curve
segments f

, meeting at cusp point c

, one stable and one unstable equilibrium
arise if the curve is crossed above the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation, otherwise,
two unstable equilibria are created. Therefore, in region III

stable limit cycle created at the Hopf bifurcation. This cycle is shown for some
parameter values in region III

in ﬁgure 24; Section 4.3.
In the regions V
d
and V
e
, we have the equilibria from region III
d
together
with the two equilibria created at the fold bifurcation marked f

. This means
that there are two stable and three unstable equilibria in region V
d
, and due
to the Hopf bifurcation at the curve h
1
, there are one stable and four unstable
equilibria in region V

. Table 4.1 summarizes the number of stable equilib-
ria in each region, also, it tells about the number of contracting directions of
theequilibria. TounderstandthesetofequilibriainregionV

From table 4.1 it is clear that all equilibria found in this analysis have one
feature in common, they all have at least three contracting directions. This
is also true for the equilibria discovered in Section 3, cf table 3.1; Section 3.2.
Moreover,alllimitcyclesfoundalsohavethisproperty,andfromSection5.4,it
follows that all Lyapunov spectra determined have at least three strongly neg-
ative exponents. From these observations one may suspect that the dynamics

4.2 The fold-Hopf bifurcation
In this section we will start by presenting some theory from [10] about center
manifolds that allow one to reduce the dimension of a given dynamical system
near a local bifurcation. The three-dimensional dynamical system restricted to
thecentermanifoldforthefold-HopfbifurcationatA = 1.2426,B =−0.016664
will be approximated with up to second order terms. Then this system is
transformed into a normal form for fold-Hopf bifurcations, and this normal
form is then analysed giving the local bifurcation diagram.
4.2.1 Center manifold theorems
Consider a continuous dynamical system deﬁned by
˙ x =f(x), x∈R
n
(17)
wheref issuﬃcientlysmoothandf(0)= 0. LettheeigenvaluesoftheJacobian

. Suppose
that there are eigenvalues with zero real part, and assume that there are n
+
eigenvalues (counting multiplicities) with Re λ > 0 , n
0
eigenvalues with Re
λ = 0 and n
−
eigenvalues with Re λ < 0. Let T
c
denote the linear eigenspace
corresponding to the union of the n
0
eigenvalues on the imaginary axis and let
ϕ
t
denote the ﬂow
3
associated with (17). Under the assumptions stated above,
the following theorem holds.
Theorem 4.1 (Center Manifold Theorem) There is a locally deﬁned
smooth n
0
-dimensional invariant manifold W
c
of (17) that is tangent to T
c
at
x = 0. Moreover, there is a neighborhood U of x

for all t≥ 0 (t≤ 0), then ϕ

Recallthattheeigenbasisisabasisformedbyall(generalized)eigenvectorsofA(ortheirlinearcombinations
if the corresponding eigenvalues are complex). Actually, the basis used in the following may not be the true
eigenbasis. Any basis in the noncritical eigenspace is allowed. In other words, the matrix C may not be in real
canonical (Jordan) form.
Electronic Journal.  31Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2005
The following theorem ends this section.
Theorem 4.2 (Reduction Principle) System(18)islocallytopologicallyequiv-
alent near the origin to the system
˙ u =Bu+g(u,V(u))
˙ v =Cv
(19)
Notice that the equations foru andv are uncoupled in (19). This means that
only the ﬁrst equation, which is the restriction of (18) to its center manifold,
has to be analysed to understand the dynamics locally near the bifurcation. In
Section 4.2.2, we will show how to determine this equation for the fold-Hopf
bifurcation.
4.2.2 Approximating the system restricted to W
c
The following calculations have been carried out using the software package
MAPLE. As a ﬁrst step, it is veriﬁed by the eigenvaluesto the Jacobianmatrix
that n
+
= 0, n
0
= 3 and n
−
= 3, which means that the center manifold to the
fold-Hopf bifurcation is three-dimensional and stable.
We now deﬁne new parametersα = (α
1
,α
2
) and new coordinates (x,g,
h,f,y,z) in system (16) such that the fold-Hopf bifurcation occurs at the pa-
rametervaluesα = 0andattheorigininthenewcoordinates. Theseparameter
values are called the critical parameter values and the point is referred to as
the critical point. With these coordinates and parameters, system (16) takes
the form
˙ x =κ(x,α), x∈R
6
, α∈R
2
(20)
where κ forms the right hand side of the equations and κ(0) = 0. In the next
step, diagonalization is used to transform system (20) into the eigenbasis of
the Jacobian matrix at the critical point. This is done in the following way,
let e
1
,...,e
6
denote the set of eigenvectors to the Jacobian matrix, where
e
1
,e
2
and e
3
are the eigenvectors corresponding to the three eigenvalues on
the imaginary axis. Then we put
P = [e
1
,...,e
6
], x = [x,g,h,f,y,z]

by

The system ˙ x = κ(x,α) can now be transformed into w coordinates by the
transformation
P ˙ w = κ(Pw,α)
which gives
˙ w =P
−1
κ(Pw,α) (21)
By writing equation (21) as two vector equations in u and v respectively, we
ﬁnd
˙ u= a(α)+B(α)u+g(u,v,α), u∈R
3
˙ v =b(α)+C(α)v+h(u,v,α), v∈R
3
(22)
where a(0) = b(0) = 0. By settingα = 0 in (22) we obtain the 3×3 matrices
B, C and the two functions g and h in the representation (18) of our system
in the eigenspace to the Jacobian matrix at the critical point.
Our next task is to ﬁnd the functionv =V(u), where V :R

the critical eigenspace T

An approximation of the restriction of (18) to its center manifold given by
the ﬁrst equation in (19) is now determined, and we will followthe theory from
Chapter 8 in [10] to determine the normal form in Section 4.2.3.

4.2.3 The normal form
In Chapter 8 in [10], the following lemma is derived for fold-Hopf bifurcations.
Lemma 4.1 Suppose that a three-dimensional system
˙ x = f(x,α), x∈R

with smooth f, has at α = 0 the equilibriumx = 0 with eigenvalues

(ZP.3) E(0)6= 0, where E(0) can be calculated using (31).
(ZP.4) the map α→(γ(α),μ(α))

is regular atα = 0.
Then, by introducing a complex variable, making smooth and smoothly parame-
ter dependent transformations, reparametrizing time (reversing it if E(0)< 0),
and introducing new parameters, one can bring system (24) into the following

Four different cases of the fold-Hopf bifurcation can occur, established by the
signs of the parameters s and θ(0). The two cases corresponding to sθ(0) < 0
are much more complex. To determine s and θ(0), we follow parts of the
derivation of the normal form (25). During these calculations we also verify
the conditions (ZP.1), (ZP.2), (ZP.3) and (ZP.5). Condition (ZP.4) is not
veriﬁed here, this because there are some printing mistakes in [10], making it
diﬃcult to understand howγ(α) is deﬁned. Therefore, we suppose that (ZP.4)
is satisﬁed, and applyLemma4.1on the three-dimensionalsystemrestrictedto
the center manifold. The system is given by the ﬁrst equation in (19), that is
˙ u =Bu+g(u,V(u)), u∈R

the ﬁrst two equations of which are independent of the third one. The equa-
tion for ϕ describes a rotation around the ξ-axis with almost constant angular
velocity ˙ ϕ ≈ ω

, for | ξ | small. Thus, to understand the bifurcations in (32),
one needs to study only the planar system for (ξ,ρ) with ρ> 0 given by

The nontrivial equilibrium E

is a stable focus if β

if β
2
> 0. For parameter values belonging to the line
T ={(β

,β
2
):β
2
= 0, β
1
< 0}
the nontrivial equilibrium has a nondegenerate Hopf bifurcation and a unique
unstablelimitcycle existsfor nearbyparametervalues. The cycle coexistswith
the two trivial equilibria E
1,2
which are saddles. Under parameter variation,
the cycle can approach a heteroclinic cycle formed by the separatrices of the
saddles, its period tends to inﬁnity and the cycle disappears. The heteroclinic
cycle appears along a curve orginatingatβ = 0 and having the representation
P =

Now we can use the obtained bifurcation diagram for (33) to reconstruct bifur-
cations in the three-dimensional truncated normal form (32) by “suspension”
of the rotation in ϕ around the ξ-axis. The equilibria E
1,2
correspond to equi-
librium points of (32). Therefore, the curve S is a fold bifurcation curve where
two equilibria appear. Equilibrium E
3
corresponds to a limit cycle in (32) of
the same stability as E
3
. The curve H, at which a small cycle bifurcates from
an equilibrium, corresponds to a Hopf bifurcation in (32). Moreover, the limit
cycle corresponds to an invariant torus. Therefore, the Hopf bifurcation curve
T describesaNeimark-Sackerbifurcationofthecycle,atwhichitgainsstability
and an unstable torus appears “around” it.

Figure19: Bifurcationdiagramfor fold-Hopfbifurcation forthe cases =1,θ(0) <0 in theβ-plane.
In the phase portraits ξ is on the horizontal axis and ρ on the vertical axis.
Finally, the curve P corresponds to a “sphere” in (32).
Adding higher order terms to the truncated system (32) will result in a
nonequivalentbifurcationdiagram. Thisbecausethespherelikesurfacethatap-
pearsforparametervaluesonthecurveP isanextremelydegeneratestructure,
which disappears when adding higher order terms. Therefore, the torus cannot
approach the “sphere”, since it simply does not exist, and must therefore dis-
appear before. Instead, system (32) may have near the curve P, in addition to
local bifurcation curves, a bifurcation set corresponding to global bifurcations
(heteroclinic tangencies, homoclinic orbits) and bifurcations of long-periodic
limit cycles (folds and period-doubling cascades).

Figure 20: Bifurcation diagram in the AB-plane close to the fold-Hopf bifurcation.
When moving from region III
d
counter clockwise around the fold-Hopf
bifurcation, we have the following. By crossing the curve f
1
entering region V
e
,
two unstable equilibria are created, which means that we have crossed branch
S
+
. One of the equilibria has three (E
2
) and one has four (E
1
) contracting
directions. E
2
gains two contracting directions when crossing the curve h
1
,
which corresponds to branch H
+
, and an unstable limit cycle occurs which
corresponds to the nontrivial equilibrium E
3
. By following this limit cycle
in the negative A-direction, we found the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. The
corresponding bifurcationcurve marked t

4.3 Some attractors in the AB-plane
In this section, we show some attractors to system (16) that occur for different
values of the parameters A and B. Figure 22 and 24 illustrate two limit cycles,
one in region I
b
and one in III
′
d
, created at the supercritical Hopf bifurcations
represented by the bifurcation curves h
2
and h
3
respectively. The following at-
tractorsare produced by choosing a point close to the originas an initialpoint.
Figure 23 shows a limitcycle in regionI

forA =B = 0, in which the variables
H and Z are constant at the values H = 3.6397 and Z = 582.3547. Figure
25 and 26 illustrates limit cycles in region III
2
for A = 2, B = 1, and in I
b
for
A = 0, B = 15 respectively. Recall that due to the symmetry in system (16),
we obtain similar attractors by changing signs of A and B.

Figure 28 illustrates a limit cycle for A = 15, B = 18. By increasing both
parameters to A = 20, B = 25, the attractor shows a quasi-periodic behaviour,
and the attracting set is an invariant torus, see ﬁgure 29. This was veriﬁed by
calculating the corresponding Lyapunov spectrum, having two zero exponents.

5 The Lyapunov spectrum
In this section we begin by presenting a deﬁnition and some properties of the
Lyapunov spectrum. Then a method for computing the exponents is shown,
andﬁnally,wedescribehowtoimplementthismethodonacomputerandshow
some results. The theory presented here has been found in [12] and [13], and
we refer to these papers for more details.
5.1 The Lyapunov spectrum deﬁned
The Lyapunov spectrum is a striking characterization of an n-dimensional dy-
namical system. It associates a set of n real values to each orbit of the system
which describes exponentialinstabilitiesof inﬁnitesimaldeviationsfromthe or-
bit. Moreover, for an ergodic
6
dynamical system, the spectrum is independent
of which orbit you choose. In more detail, consider a continuous n-dimensional
dynamical system given by
˙ x =v(x), v,x∈R
n
For an initial conditionx(0) =x
0
, we integrate the system to obtain a corre-
sponding orbit

5.2 Properties of the Lyapunov spectrum
From the deﬁnition of the spectrum it can be proved that it is independent
of the choice of coordinate system. Moreover, any continuous time dependent
dynamical system without a ﬁxed point will have at least one zero exponent,
corresponding to the linear changing magnitude of a principal axis tangent to
the ﬂow. Axes that are on the average expanding correspond to positive ex-
ponents, and contracting axes correspond to negative exponents. Also, for a
dissipativedynamicalsystem there will be at least one negative exponent. Fur-
ther, an attractor for a dissipative system with one or more positive exponents

that, for example in a three-dimensional continuous dissipative dynamical sys-
tem, we can have the following spectra; (+,0,−), a strange attractor; (0,0,−),

a torus (quasi-periodic behaviour); (0,−,−), a limit cycle; and (−,−,−), a
ﬁxed point.
5.3 Determining the Lyapunov spectrum
From the numerical point of view, the above description is insuﬃcient because
the matrixM

becomes singularratherfastsince its eigenvaluesseparate
exponentially in time, if not all exponents are equal. This makes it diﬃcult to
measure the spectrum, and in this section we shall present a method for doing
this in which we augment the given dynamical system with an orthonormal
frame and a Lyapunov vector. The method applies to any ﬁnite-dimensional
dynamical system.
We deﬁne a time-dependent orthonormalk-frame to be the set of k(k≤n)
orthonormal n-dimensional vectors
ε(t) =e

(t),...,e
k
(t) (e
i
,e
j
)≡ δ
ij
i≤ i,j ≤ k (36)
where (.,.) is the usual Euclidean product in R
n
. Using this frame, we let the
matrix elements of the Jacobian matrixJ be given by
J
lm
= (e
l
,Je
m
), l,m≤k
which depend on time both through the Jacobian and the frame. Further, we
introduce a stability parameter β > 0, and deﬁne the symmetric stabilized
matrix elements L
mm
and L
lm
as
L
mm
=J
mm
+β((e

)−1), m≤k
and
L

), l6=m, l,m≤ k
Finally, let Λ = {Λ

(t),...,Λ
k
(t)} be a k-dimensional real vector. The aug-
mented dynamicalsystem is now given by the followingset of differentialequa-
tions, of which the ﬁrst two are vector equations

For system (37) we have the following theorem.
Theorem 1 Letx

exists. Set Λ(t = 0) = 0. Choosing
the stability parameter β > −λ
k
, then for almost any (i.e. with probability
1 when choosing randomly) initial frame ε(t = 0) the time evolution of the
dynamical system (37) yields
lim

m = 1,...,k
Thus, by following a trajectory of the augmented system we obtain almost
surely the k ﬁrst exponents in the Lyapunov spectrum for the given orbit. The
condition on the stability parameter is satisﬁed, for example by setting
β > max
kek=1
(−(e,Je)) (38)
where the maximum is over all unit-length vectorse and over the relevant re-
gion of phase space. Dynamically, this corresponds to ﬁnding the strongest
local contraction. For details and a proof of the above theorem, see [12].
5.4 Implementations and results
In order to implement the augmented dynamical system (37), we use the same
algorithm as in the rest of the simulations on the Bekryaev system, that is, a
Runge-Kutta method in C-code. When calculating the complete spectrum, we
get k = n = 6, which means that the augmented system to implement gets a
dimension of 48. As an initial frame, we chose the orthonormal set of vectors
e

(j) =
(

0i6=j
1≤i,j ≤ 6

Also, we start at a point on the attractor of which we want to calculate the
spectrum. Further, in addition to the main system to simulate, the program

insystem(37). Tochoosethestabilityparameterβ suchthatcondition
(38) is satisﬁed, we started with β = 0, and at each step in the simulation we
check the condition
β ≤ max(−J
mm
) m = 1,...,k (39)
If (39) holds we let β = max(−J
mm
)+1. After completed one simulation one
may ﬁx β as some value greater than the value obtained above to speed up
future simulations.
Figure 30 shows the result of a simulation of the Bekryaev system (1) with
the parametersA = 2, B = 0, Q
F

(2). We have the attractor CA discussed in Section 3, the spectrum obtained
yields (+,0,−,−,−,−) which indicates a strange attractor. In this case we
had the stability parameter β = 416. The elapsed time for this simulation was
approximately 20 hours. In table 5.1, we present the result of some more cal-
culationsof the Lyapunov spectrum for the attractorCA. All spectra obtained
for the Bekryaev system 1 include at least three strongly negative exponents.
