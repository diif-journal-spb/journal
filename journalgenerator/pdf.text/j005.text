Abstract.
The notion of astatism broadly used in classical linear control theory is ex-
tended to nonlinear systems. Some basic assertions concerning with the prop-
erties of astatic systems are presented. A special attention is paid to robust
control problems of Lagrangian systems and robotic manipulators as a partic-
ular case. It is shown that PID control ensure robust stabilization of a desired
position and tracking with a bounded error if the desired velocities are small
enough.

1 Introduction
The astatism is an extensively used notion in classical linear theory. Astatic
systems have zero steady-state error if disturbances are constant or tend to
constant values. Moreover, for linear systems the astatism ensure a bounded
reaction under any unbounded disturbances having bounded derivatives. In
linearcasetheastatismconditionsareverysimple. Itisnecessaryandsuﬃcient
to have stable transfer function with a numerator having zero root. It is of
practical interest to show what is a nonlinear astatic system, to state some
conditions ensuring the astatism and to clear up if the properties of linear
astatic systems are saved in nonlinear case. The paper gives some answers for
these questions. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the general results can be
usedfortheexplanationofrobustnessofPIDfeedbackinnon-linearLagrangian
systems and in robotics especially.
2 Astatism and boundedness of reactions
Let a system be presented in the form
˙ x =f(x,w(t)), x(0) =x
0
; y =g(x,w(t)) (1)
where x is the state vector, y is the output vector, w(t) is the vector of distur-
bances (inputs), andf(x,w) satisﬁes conditions ensuring existence and unique-
ness of solutions to (1) under any admissible w(t)∈W, t∈ [0,∞).
Deﬁnition. The system (1) is internally astatic if it has an isolated
equilibrium point x = 0 and this equilibrium is asymptotically stable under any
w(t) =w =const,w∈W.
The system (1) is input–output astatic if it has an asymptotically stable
solution x =x
∞
(w) under any w(t) =w =const,w∈W and
g(x
∞
(w),w) = 0.
Let f and g be linear in x and w, or more precisely, let
f(x,w) =Ax+Bw, g(x,w) =Cx+Dw
where A,B,C,D are constant matrices. Then the deﬁnition presented above
coincides with the deﬁnition of classical linear theory (see, f.e. [1]) and the
astatism conditions are equivalent the following ones:
Electronic Journal.  122Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 1997
– A is stable (Hurwitzian),
– A
−1
B = 0 (for internal astatism) or D−CA
−1
B = 0 (for input–output
astatism).
However, if f is linear in x only, i.e.
f(x,w) =A(w)x+B(w), (2)
then the astatism conditions have to include the stability of A(w) under all
w∈W, i.e. the parametric robustness condition.
It is clear now that the generalized notion of astatism introduced above is
much more sophisticated than the traditional notion of linear theory.

in the form (2) (with A(w) =
∂f
∂x
(0,w),B(w) =
∂f
∂w
(0,w)) is internally astatic
then the original non-linear system (1) is internally astatic too.
The basic problem under consideration is the following one. Let the system
(1) be internally astatic. Is it true that the output y(t) is bounded under any
w(t)∈W which are unbounded but have a bounded derivative?
Theorem 1

. Let the system (1) be internally astatic on a set of time–
constant disturbances w ∈ W and moreover, there exists a Lyapunov function
V(x,w) such that
V(x,w)→∞ under kxk→∞ for any w∈W (3)
and its time derivative

V deﬁned on trajectories of the system (1) under w =

Theorem 2. Let x = 0 be asymptotically stable equilibrium of the system
(1) under any constant w∈W and moreover there exists a Lyapunov function
V(x,w) satisfying (3) (i.e. radially unbounded) and
˙
V ≤−Q(x), under kxk≤R
where Q(x)> 0,kxk6= 0, Q(0) = 0,
Q(x)

Then, under any Δ> 0, one can show δ> 0 and R

The Theorem 2 gives some suﬃcient conditions under which the astatism
yields a boundedness of reactions if the disturbances have a bounded rate of
changements. Naturally, the conditions are much harder and “more local” then
in the linear case.
Note that the conditions of theorems 1,2 concerning with a “regular” be-
havior of Lyapunov functions in w are nontrivial.
Let f(x,w) be continuously differentiable in x and w, and uniformly Lips-
chitzianinxunderallw∈W. Letthesystem(1)haveanasymptoticallystable
solution underw =const∈W. Then following Massera theorem (see, f.e. [3]),
one can state only that there exists a smooth Lyapunov function V(x,w) such
that underkxk≤R:
a(kxk,w)≤V(x,w)≤b(kxk,w),
˙
V(x,w)≤−c(kxk,w),

where a,b,c are smooth positive anywhere (except zero x) functions monoto-
nously increasing with kxk (i.e. class K functions) and d,e are non-negative
smooth function. Sometimes one can show a limited upper bounds which are
independent on w; and it is possible not only for a bounded W. In those cases
any solutions to (1) are uniformly ultimately bounded, i.e. x(t) converges
in a ball if k ˙ wk and kx
0
k are small enough. In other terminology the system
(1) is dissipative. Proof of this assertion is analogous to the proof of Malkin
theorem on dissipativity under nonvanishing bounded disturbances (see, f.e.
[3]).

3 Astatic servomechanisms
In many cases the description (1) does not allow to express completely the
disturbance inﬂuence on the system behavior. In particular, it takes place in
thetrackingproblemswhereadesiredtrajectoryplaysroleofadisturbance,and
zero value of tracking errors is the desired equilibrium point (or it is required
to ensure uniform ultimate boundedness of those errors).
Let, f.e., it be desired that the state x(t) of the closed–loop system
˙ x =F(x,u), u =k(x,x
d
),
wherek(x,x
d
) is a static feedback control law (F(x
d
,k(x
d
,x
d
))≡ 0), converges
to a differentiable process x
d
(t), i.e. the output y(t) = x(t)−x
d
(t) tends to
zero. Denoting
y =x−x
d
and f(x,x
d
) =F(x,k(x,x
d
))
one obtain
˙ y =f(y+x
d
,x
d
)− ˙ x
d
If one return to the symbols introduced in the astatism deﬁnition, i.e. (y→x,
x
d
→w), one has
˙ x =f(x+w,w)− ˙ w (f(w,w)≡ 0)
One can see now that the right–hand side depends not only on w as in (1) but
on ˙ w also.
Note that the output coincides here with the state of the system and hence
the notion of internal astatism coincides with the notion of input–output as-
tatism.
In more general case if one desires to estimate the tracking errors for the
closed–loop system described by the differential equations of n-th order

(n−1)
,k(x,... ,x

one has to consider behavior of solutions to the equations of the following type

where x,w stand now for the errors and the desired trajectory.

where f

(0,w)≡ 0 and f

(x,w,0,... ,0)≡ 0
be useful in applications.
Note that the astatism property is deﬁned by f

(x,w) only. However the
system reaction depend on f
1
too.
Theorem 3. Let the system
˙ x =f

(x,w) (8)
be astatic and moreover there exists a radially unbounded Lyapunov function
V(x,w) such that

4 Integral feedback and astatism
Consider the following system
˙ z =f(z,u,w), z(0) =z
0
(9)
where u is a control. Choose u in the form of integral feedback
˙ u =−μψ(z); u(0) = 0 (10)
where μ> 0, ψ(0) = 0, z
T
ψ(z)6= 0 under z6= 0, .
Under w = const the closed–loop system (9), (10) has the unique equilib-
rium
z = 0, u =u
∞
(w) =const.
The system is astatic if the equilibrium is asymptotically stable. Let under
zero control and w =const∈W the system (9) have an asymptotically stable
solution
z =z
∞
(w), f(z
∞
(w),0,w)≡ 0.
The integral feedback (10) is introduced to shift that equilibrium to the desired
position z = 0 independently on any w =const∈W.
First of all, as in the linear theory, one has to know if the stability is not
destroyed.
Theorem 4. Let f and ψ be twice differentiable functions. Let, under any
w∈W and u∈U, U be bounded and the equation
f(z,u,w) = 0
have a root z
∞
(u,w) which is locally exponentially stable equilibrium of the
system (9) under w =const∈W, u =const∈U. Let the system
˙ u =−μψ(z
∞
(u,w)) (11)
have a locally exponentially stable solution.
Then there exists ¯ μ > 0, such that under any μ ∈ (0;¯ μ], the closed–loop
system (9), (10) is input–output astatic with input w and output z.
Proof to the theorem 4 is based on classical results by Tikhonov (see, f.e.
[5, 1]) and Klimushev [6]. In fact, let us introduce a “slow” time τ =μt. Then
(9), (10) can be rewritten in a singular perturbed form
du
dτ
=−ψ(z), μ
dz
dτ
=f(z,u,w) (12)
Electronic Journal.  127Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 1997
Under a small μ, the control u is a “slow” variable in reference to the object
statez(t).Thesystem(11)isthereducedoneinreferenceto(12)anditgivesan
appropriate description of the “slow” variables. The conditions of the Theorem
ensure that existence of the exponentially stable solution to the reduced system
yieldstheconvergenceofu(t)deﬁnedbytheoriginalsystemtoaconstantvalue.
However, due to the properties of ψ(z) it is possible only if z(t)→ 0.
Remark1. If the system (9) has globally asymptotically stable and locally
exponentially stable equilibrium (i.e. globally asymptotically stable hyperbolic
equilibrium)underu =const∈U andthesystem(11)alsohasgloballyasymp-
totically stable and locally exponentially stable solution under w =const∈W
then the closed–loop system (9), (10) has globally stable equilibrium under
positive μ, small enough. It follows from Hoppensteadt theorem [7].
Remark 2. Under some properties of the functions f,ψ ensuring the uni-
queness of zero equilibrium point, the condition z
T
ψ(z)6= 0 under z 6= 0 may
be omitted. Moreover all results are true if f,ψ smoothly depend on μ.
5 Astatism of controlled Lagrangian system and a slow
tracking
Consider a dynamical system described by the Lagrangian equation
A(q)¨ q+C(q, ˙ q)˙ q+g(q) =Q (13)
where, by deﬁnition, q is n-vector of generalized coordinates, A(q) is a positive
deﬁnite inertia matrix, C(q, ˙ q)˙ q is a vector of centrifugal and Coriolis forces
such that
˙
A(q) =C(q, ˙ q)+C
T
(q, ˙ q)
and g(q) is a vector of gravitational forces,
Let
Q =w+v

Electronic Journal.  128Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 1997
Under ˆ u =const, one can show [8] that the system (13), (14) has globally

Theorem 5. Under the conditions (16), (18) and μ> 0 small enough the
closed–loop system (13), (14), (17) has GAS equilibrium (q,u) = (q

) ≡
(q

[g(q

The result follows from the Theorem 4 and Remark 1 if one uses special
types of Lyapunov functions (energy like one as in [9, 10, 11] and Lur’e –
Postnikov like one:

) for the fast
and reduced systems corresponding to (13), (14) and (17) with q = ¯ q given by
(15) and for their ﬁrst approximation systems.
It proves the astatism of the Lagrangian system with PID feedback in ref-
erence to constant external forces.
For the particular case of linear feedback that result was shown early in
[12].
Using the Theorem 3 and the Lyapunov function presented in [4] one can
show now that PID feedback ensures a tracking of a desired trajectory q
d
(t)
with a bounded error if q
d
(t) is changed slowly enough.

6 Conclusion
The results presented in the paper allow to extend the useful notion of astatism
tononlinearsystems. Itisnecessarytohaveinmindthatinnon–linearsystems
the astatism does not ensure a boundedness of tracking errors if the desired ve-
locities are very large. However, some numerical simulations for robotic manip-
ulators show that the upper level of admissible velocities may have practically
reasonable high value.
