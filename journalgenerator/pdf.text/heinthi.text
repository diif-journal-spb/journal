Abstract
This paper considers the exponential stabilization problem for a class of linear sys-
tems with mixed time delays in both state and control. By using an improved Lyapunov-
Krasovskii functional and memoryless controller, new conditions for the exponential sta-
bilization of the system are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). This
approach allows to compute simultaneously the two bounds that characterize the ex-
ponential stability rate of the solution. A numerical example is given to illustrate the
effectiveness of our result.
Keywords: Exponential stabilization, mixed time delays, linear matrix inequalities.

1 Introduction
Time delays in control inputs are often encountered in many practical sys-
tems because of transmission of the measurement information. The existenceDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2008
of these delays may be the source of instability and serious deterioration in the
performance of the closed-loop systems. Therefore, the problem of stability and
stabilization of control systems with input delays has been received consider-
able attention from many researchers (see, e.g. [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 17, 19, 20, 22]
and references therein). The stability problem has been considered mostly for
linear time-invariant control systems with state and control delays. The lead
to memoryless controllers which means control law of the form u(t) = Kx(t)
([8, 13, 22]), or to more general controllers with memory that include, neverthe-
less, an instantaneous feedback termu(t) =Kx(t) +

): Another
method to improve the control of linear time-invariant systems with input de-
lay is the reduction method proposed in [1], which reduces the system under
consideration to a delay-free ordinary system by certain state transformation.
Based on the reduction method, Moon et. al. [12] proposed a delay feedback
controller for the robust stability of linear uncertain systems with input delay.
By using an improved state transformation, Chen and Zheng [3], Yue [19], Yue
and Han [20], derived su cient conditions for the robust stabilization of linear
uncertain systems with unknown input delay in terms of LMI's but the system
is required to be global controllable.
Recently, special interest has been devoted to the exponential stability and
stabilization problem for linear time-delay systems [5, 6, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16,
18]. Based on linear matrix inequalities approach [2], a systematic procedure
for  nding exponential stability conditions has been proposed in [11] for LTI
systems with constant delay. In [9, 15, 18], by using state transformation (t) =
e
 t
x(t), delay-dependent conditions for robust exponential stability of linear
uncertain systems with constant delay were given in terms of LMIs. By also
using the state transformation method, [14] gives conditions for the exponential
stability of non-autonomous systems with constant delay in terms of solution
of Riccati-type differential equation, which is further improved in [16] by using
Razumikhin method.
In this paper, the results of [9]-[13], [18]-[20] will be extended to linear
systems with mixed delays in both state and control:

By using an improved Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, new delay-dependent
conditions for the exponential stabilization are derived in terms of linear ma-
trix inequalities. The conditions do not require any assumption about the
controllability of the nominal system, e.g., neither (A;B) nor (A +D;B) needs

to be controllable. The approach also allows to compute simultaneously the
two bounds that characterize the exponential stability rate of the solution.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents notations, de nitions
and some technical propositions needed for the proof of the main result. Delay-
dependent conditions for exponential stabilization and an illustrated example
are presented in Section 3. The paper ends with conclusions and cited refer-
ences.

can  nd the maximum upper bound of the delays that guarantees exponential
stabilization of system (1) with decay rate ff.
Remark 3.2 The linear control systems with input delay considered in previous
works (e.g. [1, 3, 8, 12, 19, 20, 22]) are special cases of the system (1), where

4 Conclusion
This paper has proposed new conditions for the exponential stabilization of
linear systems with mixed delays in both state and control. Based on an im-
proved Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the delay-dependent exponential sta-
bility conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities which allows
to compute simultaneously the two bounds that characterize the exponential
stability of the solution. A numerical example is given to show the effectiveness
of the obtained result.
