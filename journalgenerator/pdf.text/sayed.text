Abstract: We present existence theorem of weak solutions for Hammerstein

weak minimal solutions for these integral equations and ¯nally prove the exis-
tence of the weak maximal and minimal solutions.
Keywords: Weak solution; Urysohn integral equation ; Hammerstein integral

Now, we shall present some auxiliary results that will be need in this work.

(2) A function h : E ! E is said to be sequentially continuous if h maps
weakly convergent sequences in E to weakly convergent sequences in E:
If x is weakly continuous on I; then x is strongly measurable and hence
weakly measurable (see[3] and [2]). Note that in re°exive Banach space weakly
measurable functions are Pettis integrable if and only if Á(x(:)) is Lebesgue
integrable on I for every Á2E

(see[3] pp. 78). Now we state a ¯xed point
theorem and some propositions which will be used in the sequel (see[9]).
Theorem1.1. Let E beaBanachspaceandlet Q beanonempty,bounded,
closed and convex subset of the space E and let T : Q ! Q be a weakly
sequentially continuous and assume that TQ(t) is relatively weakly compact
in E for each t2[0;1] . Then, T has a ¯xed point in the set Q:

Let E be a re°exive Banach space and D½E: Consider the following assump-

(1) g2C[I;E] ;
(2) f : I£D!E satis¯es the following
(i) For each t2I; f
t

(ii) For each x2D; f(:;x(:)) is weakly measurable on I ;
(iii) The weak closure of the range of f(I£D) is weakly compact in E
(or equivalently: there exists an M such that jjf(t;x)jj · M

k(t;s) f(s;x(s)) ds; t2I:
For any x 2 C[I;E] and since f(:;x(:)) is weakly measurable on I
and jjf(t;x)jj · M; then Á(f(:;x(:))) is Lebesgue integrable on
I 8Á 2 E
¤
and since k(t;:) is Lebesgue integrable on I; then we have
Á(k(t;:)f(:;x(:))) = k(t;:)Á(f(:;x(:))) isLebesgueintegrableon I 8Á2E

;
then k(t;:) f(:;x(:)) is Pettis integrable on I: Thus T is well de¯ned.
We shall prove that T : C[I;E]!C[I;E]:

Then Q is nonempty, uniformly bounded and strongly equi-continuous subset

4 The weak maximal and weak minimal solutions
Now we give the following de¯nition
De¯nition 4.1 Let q(t) be a weak solution of (1) Then q(t) is said to be a
weak maximal solution of (1) if every weak solution x(t) of (1) satis¯es the
inequality
Á(x(t)) < Á(q(t)); 8Á2E
¤
: A weak minimal solution s(t) can be de¯ned
bysimilarwaybyreversingtheaboveinequalityi.e. Á(x(t)) > Á(s(t)); 8Á2

:
In this section f assumed to satisfy the following assumption:
(4) for any x; y2 E satisfying Á(x(t)) < Á(y(t)); 8Á2 E
¤
implies that
Á(f(s;x(s)))< Á(f(s;y(s)))
Lemma 4.1 Let f(t;x); k(t;s) satisfy assumptions of Theorem 2.1
and let x(t); y(t) 2C[I;E] on I satisfying
Á(x(t)) · Á(g(t)) +

where one of them is strict.
If (f(t;x)) satis¯es assumption (4). Then
Á(x(t)) < Á(y(t)): (4)
proof: Let the conclusion (4) be false, then there exists t

such that
Á(x(t

and
Á(x(t)) < Á(y(t)) 0 < t < t

Theorem 4.1 Let the assumptions of Theorem 2.1 be satis¯ed. If f(t;x)
satis¯es assumption (4), then there exist a weak maximal and weak minimal
solutions of (1).

(1). Let ²>0 be given. Now consider the integral equation

k(t;s) ( Á(f(s;x

Using Lemma 4.1, then (6) and (7) implies
Á(x
²
2
(t))<Á(x
²
1
(t)) for t2 [0;1]:
As shown before in the proof of Theorem 2.1 the family of functions x
²
(t)
de¯ned by (5) is uniformly bounded and of strongly equi-continuous functions.
Hence by Arzela-Ascoli Theorem , there exists a decreasing sequence ²
n
such
that ² ! 0 as n ! 1; and lim
n!1
x
²
n
(t) exists uniformly in [0;1]
and denote this limit by q(t): from the weakly sequentially continuity of
the function f

Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal/ 58Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2008
which proves that q(t) as a solution of (1).
Finally, we shall show that q(t) is the weak maximal solution of (1). To do
this, let x(t) be any weak solution of (1). Then
Á(x

applying Lemma 4.1, we get
Á(x
²
(t)) > Á(x(t)) for t 2 [0;1]:
fromtheuniquenessofthemaximalsolution(see[2]),itisclearthat x
²
(t) tends
to q(t) uniformly in t 2 [0;1] as ²!0:
By similar way as done above we can prove that s(t) is the weak minimal
solution of (1).
The weak maximal and minimal solutions of (2) can be de¯ned in the same
fashion as done above.
Now, the function u assumed to satisfy the following assumption:
(4
¤
) for any x; y2 E satisfying Á(x(t)) < Á(y(t)); 8Á2 E
¤
implies that
Á(u(t;s;x(s)))< Á(u(t;s;y(s)))
Now the following lemma can be proved.
Lemma 4.2 Let u(t;s;x) satis¯es assumptions of Theorem 3.1
and let x(t); y(t) 2C[I;E] on I satisfying
Á(x(t)) · Á(g(t)) +

¤
where one of them is strict.
If (u(t;s;x)) satis¯es assumption (4
¤
). Then
Á(x(t)) < Á(y(t)):
Theorem 4.2 Let the assumptions of Theorem 3.1 be satis¯ed. If u(t;s;x)
satis¯es assumption (4
¤
), then there exists a weak maximal and weak minimal
solutions of (2).

By similar way as done above we can prove that s(t) is the weak minimal
