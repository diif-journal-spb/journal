can be converted to Volterra’s integral equation of second kind [see [3]]. For
initial condition ∂

y(a) = 0 for i = 0,1,..,n−1, the corresponding Volterra’s
equation is given by;

Clearly this conditions can be satisﬁed if P

following theorem;

for i =
0,1,..,n−1 the answer for homogenous differential equation inC[a,b] is given
by (20) in which a is replaced by b. One can derive solutions of homogenous
differential equation, with speciﬁc boundary conditions on either a or b, by
using (20). By substituting solutions of homogenous differential equation with
suitableboundaryconditions(derivedby (20))in tothe expressionsfor Green’s
functionsgivenbymethodofvariationofparameters,onecanderivetheGreen’s

3 Conclusion
Causal Green’s function for general linear differential operator in one variable
wasgivenby[theorem1]as series ofintegrals. Multiplicativepropertyofcausal
Green’s functions is shown by [theorem 2]. For differential operators which are
equal to multiplications of ﬁrst order linear differential operators, explicit for-
mula(15),wasgivenforcausalGreen’sfunctions. Aninﬁnitenon-abeliangroup
of operators on a subspace ofC
∞
[a,b] is introduced. Analytic formula for fun-
damental solutions of homogenous linear differential equation in one variable
wasgivenviaequation(7)andforspeciﬁcboundaryconditionviaequation(20)
as series of integrals. By using equation (20) and the method of variation of
parameters a way to derive Green’s functions with arbitrary boundary condi-
tions in one variable according to coeﬃcient functions of differential operators
was given.
