Abstract
Real two-dimensional autonomous systems of ordinary differential equations whose
unperturbed parts are vector homogeneous polynomials of the second order are considered.
As to perturbations, they are formal vector power series whose expansions don't contain
members of order less than three.
A normalization of the unperturbed part of the system is presented. Namely, nine-
teen classes of equivalence of vector homogeneous polynomials with respect to any linear
invertible transformations have been founded. Each class is represented by a canonical
form, i.e. by a polynomial of the special representation having the maximal number of zero
coe cients.
Generalized normal forms for  ve types of systems whose unperturbed parts are
degenerate canonical forms are explicitly given. These normal forms can be obtained
by almost identical formal transformations.

real two-dimensional autonomous systems

In [1, p. 1] and [8, x 3] a method of resonance equation is stated. That makes it possible
for any system with the  xed unperturbed part to obtain all possible formally equivalent to it
generalized normal forms (GNF) in explicit form, on condition that we can overcome some
technical computational problems.
As opposed to common de nition for resonance normal forms (Poincare normal forms,
or formerly normal forms) there are a lot of de nitions for GNF. Their concise description is
given, for example, in [7], [8].
Su ciently complete and containing all the proofs the theory of resonance normal forms
(i. e. the forms where the matrix of the linear part has nonzero eigenvalues) is given in [9], and
in a reduced variant in [10], [11].
This paper pursues two objects.
1) The  rst goal is to decompose the set of systems

unperturbed according to (1) into equivalence classes with respect to linear invertible changes
of variables, i. e. to select a  nite set of most simple systems: canonical forms (CF) which are
mutually linear non-equivalent, and such systems that a system (2) may be reduced to one
of CF by a linear invertible change of variables. Here "simplicity" of a CF means that such
a form is the most appropriate variant to be the unperturbed part of (1) that later on will be
normalized by means of almost identical changes. In fact, reduction to a canonical form means
a normalization of quadratic polynomials (P
1
;P
2
) in (1) or (2).
It is proved in part II that a unperturbed system (2) has 19 canonical forms, being all
of them are constructively obtained, i.e. for every CF conditions on coe cients of (2) are given
in explicit form and the linear singular change of variables reducing this system to the selected
CF is given. It should be noted that 5 CF of 19 have two representations: main and degenerate,
being degenerate representation differs from the main one such that one of polynomials in CF,
for example P
2
; is equal to zero identically.
A similar classi cation of quadratic canonical forms, including degenerate ones, was pre-
viously realized in [2, x 2]. On basis of this classi cation in [2] { [6] investigations of formal
equivalence of system (1) with 11 CF, each taken as the unperturbed part, were carried out
and then all the GNF were constructed.
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 50Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2010
However, as it turned out that given classi cation was not complete and had some short-
comings, because at that time the conditions (that have to be in a de nition of CF) both
on the location of nonzero coe cients in P
1
; P
2
and polynomial normalizing were not clearly
formulated.
These conditions are formulated below in p. 3.3, part II. They do not effect essentially on
the following normalization of the system (1), but allows us to extract uniquely so called 'main
CF' and linearly equivalent to it additional canonical forms that either have the same number
of nonzero elements which may not be located on optimal places or are normalized by other
way.
Indicated differences in de nition CF led to the situation when in the process of investiga-
tion of GNF in some initial systems additional (according to the classi cation given in [2,x 2]),
but not main CF were taken.
In part II all mentioned shortcomings of the previous classi cation are eliminated, and
the classi cationf is based on other principles, which allowed one to prove the pairwise linear
nonequivalence for obtained CF and to state in explicit form the conditions on the initial system
(1) wherein it may be reduced to a de nite CF.
2) The second goal of the paper is to normalize all the systems (1) in which every of 5
degenerate CF is sequentially taken as the unperturbed part.
Generally speaking, such a normalization is less effective as compared with normaliza-
tion the system (1) whose unperturbed part is given by a main canonical form equivalent to
a degenerate one. But inasmuch as main canonical forms turn out to be more complex than
degenerate ones, up to now due to considerable computational di culties there is no complete
normalization for some of them.
In part III for a system (1) with the unperturbed part selected from 5 degenerate CF and
an arbitrary perturbation all GNF that may be obtained by almost identical transformation
are written. Examples of normal forms with special structures are also given.
For completeness it should be noted that there is one more method to normalize (1) with
a degenerate CF in the unperturbed part. For this purpose we should take some term (or
terms) from the perturbation X
2
of (1) that has order greater than two and put it on the place
of the absent quadratic polynomial P
2
, so that we can justify orders by assigning a weight to
each variable.
The above method is described in [1, p. 1] and implemented in [8, x 6]. It is clear that in
GNF the new (not quadratic) polynomial P
2
does not change (do not annul even partially),
but using the polynomial we can annul some additional terms of the perturbation.
At last, part IV contains results concerning the problem of obtaining all GNF (in explicit
form) of systems having one of 19 CF as the unperturbed part.

De nition 1 We will call equations (7) resonant ones.
The main goal of the method of the same name that we describe here is to obtain resonant
equations in explicit form, i.e. to calculate factors c
ps
 i
:
However, solving the problem often faces considerable technical obstacles, being their com-
plexity depends on the number of nonzero coe cients in P
1
; P
2
:
Consequently, we have to simplify the quadratic unperturbed part of system (1) as much
as possible, reducing the system to so called canonical form (CF) by a linear invertible change
of variables.
In the special case that the system has the linear  rst approximation, the reducing it to
a CF means clearly the reducing the matrix of the linear part to a Jordan form. There is no
general accepted de nition for CF in this case.
The principles of de nition of canonical form will be formulated below, reasoning from
demands that arise when solving system (6) and alleviate the problem.
As was mentioned above it is the minimization of the number of nonzero coe cients in P
1
and P
2
that is the important criterion of simplifying system (6).
The question of considerable importance is which coe cients should be annulled in the
 rst place. So, for P
1
it is the best way (if that is possible) to put c
1
= 0; for P
2
{ a
2
= 0:
It turns out that it is su cient to eliminate 3 summands in left-side hands of system (6).
It is also clear that the more residual nonzero coe cients may be normalized by 1 the
simpler the solving (6) will be.
In speci c cases one of polynomials in (1) (for example P
2
) may be transformed to
a polynomial that is equal to zero identically. Then consequent simpli cations of P
1
lead to
arising degenerate CF which are linearly equivalent to main CF and, as mentioned above, have
advantages and disadvantages.
In conclusion we remind some de nition from [1] that will be necessary later on.
De nition 2 The coe cients of homogeneous polynomials Y
(p+1)
i
in (4), entering at least
in one of resonant equations (7) will be called resonant coe cients, and the other { nonresonant
ones. The coe cients of homogeneous polynomials h
(p)
i
which remain free when solving (6) will
be called resonant ones.
We correlate the matrix  
p
= f 
p

g
np
 ;k=1
; where  
p
 k
= c
ps
k

k
with an arbitrary set

; where k = 1;n

De nition 3 We call a set of n
p
coe cients of homogeneous polynomials Y
(p+1)
i
resonant
if det  
p
6= 0:
Thus for any p  2 resonant set is a minimal set of coe cients from Y
(p+1)
1
; Y
(p+1)
2
; such
that each of them is at least in one of equations (7), being resonant equations are uniquely decid-
able with respect to (7). In this case only different resonant coe cients may be in the resonant
set, otherwise in  
p
there will be equal columns or a zero column.
De nition 4 We will call a system (4) generalized normal form (GNF), if for any p  2
all the coe cients of homogeneous polynomials Y
(p+1)
i
are equal to zero, excepting perhaps
coe cients from a resonant set.
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 53Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2010
This de nition of GNF corresponds to the concept of generalized normal form of the  rst
order that was entered in [12].

R = 0; or R

R> 0; i. e. the sign of R
is invariant with respect to any linear invertible change of variables (9).
Actually it is easy to verify that

Remark 1 For brevity in what follows we will identify system (2) (and other systems
obtained from it) with the matrix A or polynomial P: The equations (9) will be identi ed
with the matrix L:

3.3 How to de ne a canonical form
Proposition 1 Without loss of generality we will further assume that in (2) the polynomial
P
1
(x)6  0; otherwise P
2
(x)6  0 and we can perform (14).
In system (2) we assign to any element of A or a coe cient of P
1
or P
2
an index equal
to the number that is on the place of the element in the matrix
 
1 2 3
3 2 1
!
:
De nition 6 For the matrix A of system (2) the sum of indices of its nonzero elements
is said to be matrix index.
De nition 7 The system (2) is referred to as a canonical form (CF
l
) or, that is the same,
main CF
l
; if a linear invertible change of variables (9) does not transform (2) to a system that
is more preferable than the initial one according to the following principles of hierarchy:
1) The system is nondegenerate, i. e. P
1
;P
2
6  0; and, if possible, P
1
 P
2
:
2) The matrix A has the minimal number of nonzero elements.
3) The index of A is minimal.
4) The number of elements of A with module equal to 1 is maximal.
5) The arrangement of nonzero coe cients of P
1
is the following:
5a) The order of the  rst nonzero coe cient in P
1
is minimal.
5b) The order of the last nonzero coe cient in P
1
is maximal.
6) Normalizing nonzero coe cients of the system:
6a) In P
2
left nonzero element equals 1.
6b) In P
1
the module of the right nonzero coe cient equals 1.
Remark 2 When de ning CF
l
the principles 1 { 4 are basic. The principles 5 and 6
allows us to select so called main CF
l
among existing linear equivalent canonical forms, though
other such forms may be also selected as a  rst approximation in an arbitrary perturbed system
when reducing it to GNF.
Such reasonings lead to the concept of additional CF
l
:
De nition 8 The system (2) is said to be additional canonical form (ACF
l
) if it is
linearly equivalent to a main CF
l
; but the principle 5 and maybe principle 6 do not hold.
In this case ACF
l
obtained from any nonsymmetrical CF
l
i
by (14) will be denoted as CF

To write all the canonical forms to which system (2) may be transformed by a linear change
of variables (9), we have to formulate some conditions.
Consider two cubic polynomials
Q
1
(t) =t
3
 ut
2
+vt  1; Q
2
(t) =t
3
+ (v
2
  2u)t
2
+ (u
2
  2v)t + 1; (15)
where parameters u; v have the following restrictions:
uv6= 0; 1; u6=v; u
2
+v6= 0; u +v
2
6= 0: (16)
Assertion 3 The roots of Q
1
; Q
2
satisfy one of two conditions:
9 t
0
1
; t
00
1
2R : Q
1
(t

) = 0; Q
1
(t

1
) = 0; t

6=t

;
9 ! t

2R : Q
1
(t

) = 0; 8 t

2R : Q
2
(t
2
) = 0 ) t
2
6=t
1
(t
1
;t
2
6= 0;u):
(17)
Proof Suppose that conditions (17) are not ful lled.
It means that Q
1
(t) has the unique real root t
1
=   and this root is a root for Q
2
(t)
as well. Then the polynomials (15) have the form
Q
i
(t) = (t + )(t
2
+b
i
t +c
i
) =t
3
+ (  +b
i
)t
2
+ ( b
i
+c
i
)t + c
i
(i = 1; 2):
So,

c

: From the second system we obtain
(u + )
2
= (v +

)

: Hence   > 0; otherwise u =  ; v =  
 1
; that contradicts (16).
Uniqueness condition for the real root of Q

implies the inequality b

equivalent to the impossible inequality (u + )

5 Canonical forms for system (2) in case l= 1

Hence eigenvalues of H are not equal to zero and have the form

Proposition 2 For the purpose of normalizing one of nonzero coe cients of P
0
in system
(25) may be taken 1. We assume that if ff6= 0; then ff = 1; and if ff = 0; then   = 1:
Let the change (9) x = Ly (detL =  6= 0) bring a system (2) of the form (25) to
a system (10) _ y =
e
P (y): Let us take
(e ff;
e

In addition, as matrix product is associative, we have:

Theorem 2 The system (10) obtained form a system (2) of the form (25) by change (9)
has the form

where coe cients of the polynomial
e
P

=e ffy

+
e
 y

and matrix
e
H are introduced in (27).
So, the case l = 1 is invariant with respect to change (9).
Proof The formula (29) follows from equalities:
e
P (y)
(11)
= L

P (Ly)
(25)

Note that the condition e ff

+
e

= 0 is equivalent to ff

5.2 Construction of canonical forms when l = 1
Without loss of generality we suppose that in (25) ff6= 0; as if ff = 0 then by renumbering
(14) we have a system (29) of the form
 
e
P
1
e
P

+p

!
:
Now, following to Proposition 2 we take ff = 1; i. e. the common factor in (25) is always
P
0
=x
1
+ x
2
:
To simplify (25) we take at  rst such a change (9) that reduces matrix H to a Jordan
form
e
H in (29).
It is evidently that the form of the change depends on the sign of the discriminant
D = (p
1
+q
2
)
2
  4 
pq
from the formula (26) for eigenvalues of matrix H  
1;2
6= 0:
Then in (29) with Jordan matrix
e
H we will perform an arbitrary change (9) choosing
its coe cients such that the obtained system be the simplest in the sense of de nition 7 {
a canonical form (CF
2
):
We will mark all the elements of obtained system by the symbol  . Similarly to (27)
coe cients of
 
P
0
have the form

Assertion 5 For system (2) the condition P
2
(x)  0 is invariant with respect to any
change (9) with r

Proof Perform in the system (2)with P

Assertion 6 Any change (9) with r

The assertion 6 immediately follows from (38).
In accordance with assertion 4 for l = 2 there is such k; that in (2) P

system (2) has one of two forms:

and detH =

By following to proposition 2, we assume that in system (39), if ff6= 0; then ff = 1

Remark 12 The system (39) may be written in the form (40), but the form (39) is more
preferable as it allows us to use results obtained for (25).
Proposition 3 To eliminate an ambiguity appearing when factoring out the linear common
factor P

from P in system (39) , we arrange for (if it is possible) to factor out such a linear
common factor that in matrix H the eigenvalue

6.2 Construction of degenerate canonical forms for l = 2
Simplify system (39), following to the scheme of contraction for (25).
By theorem 2 a change (9) brings both system (25) and system (39) to (29)
e
P =


(e ff;
e
 ); y
ff
e
Hy; where vector (e ff;
e
 ) and matrix
e
H are de ned in (27), but  
e pe q
= det
e
H = 0:
Take a change (9) such that in system (29) matrix
e
H become Jordan matrix, which is
possible due to formula (27
2
) .
So, if  
1
= p
1
+kq
1
6= 0; then change (9) with L
1
=
 
1 q
1
k  p
1
!
; and if  
1
= 0; then
q
1
6= 0 and change (9) with L
2
=
 
1 0
k q
 1
1
!
transforms system (39) in systems (29) of two
following forms:
e ff =ff + k;
e
  =ffq
1
  p
1
;
e
H =
 
p
1
+kq
1
0
0 0
!
or
e
A =
 
 
1
e ff

e

!
;
e ff =ff + k;
e
  = q
 1
1
;
e
H =
 
0 1
0 0
!
or
e
A =
 
0 e ff
e
 
0 0 0
!
:
(41)
By this means the existence of zero eigenvalue  
2
of H resulted in
e
P
2
  0 in systems (41):
Further by change (9) we will simplify as much as possible and normalize systems (41
1
)
and (41
2
); such that the condition P
2
  0 holds. Thereby we reduce the systems to the
canonical forms for which principle 1 is not satis ed.
Taking into account assertion 5 we note that an arbitrary change (9) with r
2
= 0 brings
systems (41

) to systems

6.3 The construction of main and additional CF for l = 2
Generally speaking, with a view to further normalization of perturbed systems it is unsu ciently
to bring systems (41) and together with them systems (39) or (40) to a DCF
2
: Principle 1 has
to be hold for a total normalization. Hence we will transform every DCF
2
i
in a nondegenerate
CF
2
by change(9).
Remark 15 A CF
2
obtained from a DCF
2
i
has as a rule more nonzero elements, which
is a reasonable "pay" for greater opportunities on the further normalization of perturbations.
Remark 16 A speci cs of the case l = 2 is such that due to a proportionality
of coe cients in polynomials P
1
; P
2
in systems (39) or (40) principle 1 in the de nition
of canonical form is fully applied, i. e. namely for l = 2 the requirement P
1
 P
2
(k = 1) is
actual. But principle 3 loses its value completely.

; 0) iff for any p  2 coe cients of homogeneous polynomials Y
(p+1)

(i = 1; 2)
satisfy 3 resonance equations (56).
Corollary 7 Any resonance set contains 3 coe cients:
1) the coe cient Y
(0;p+1)
2
; 2) any coe cient of Y
(s;p+1 s)
2
(1 s p + 1);
3) any coe cient of Y
(s;p+1 s)
1
(3 s p+1) or any coe cient of Y
(s;p+1 s)
2
(1 s p+1)
which is differ from the coe cient selected in 2), except Y
(1;p)
2
and Y
(2;p 1)
2
which can not be
in a resonance set simultaneously , because for them det  
p
= 0:
Theorem 13 A system (52) by a formal change (9) may be transformed in GNF (4),
where for any p  2 all the coe cients Y
(p+1)
i
(i = 1; 2) are equal to zero, except possibly 3
coe cients from a resonance set.
Example 1 A system (52) by a formal change (9) may be reduced to GNF (4), where in
the  rst equation there is no perturbation term:

It should be noted that there is no GNF in which we could annul y

(s  3); because any
resonant set contains either Y

or Y
(s;p+1 s)

p = 2r +  (r  1;  2f0; 1g); s = 2  +  +  ( (  + )=2   r;  2f0; 1g):
As a consequence of it, for any r  1;  2f0; 1g system (58) has the form:

p=2
X
(p+1)
i
(x) { the perturbation,
X
(r)
i
is a homogeneous polynomial by the order r (i = 1; 2); is naturally divides into 2 phase.
I) On the  rst phase by using linear invertible changes (9) we simplify the unperturbed
part of system (1), i. e. the vector of homogeneous quadratic polynomial P = (P
1
;P
2
):
In part II the set of systems (2) is divided into 19 linearly nonequivalent classes. For
each class canonical form (see de nition 7) is the simplest representative, being the form is an
analogue to a Jordan matrix for linear systems.
Depending on the order l of the common factor of polynomials P
1
and P
2
(see de nition
5) the set of canonical forms is divided into 3 subsets.
It is turned out that if P
1
and P
2
do not have a common factor (l = 0); (and
according to assertion 1 this is equivalent to the fact that corresponding them resultant
R 6= 0 ), then system (2) may be brought to one of 10 canonical forms: CF
0
1
{ CF
0
10
:
If P
1
and P
2
have a common factor of the  rst order, then system (2) is reduced to one
of 5 canonical forms: CF
1
1
{ CF
1
5
: At last, if P
1
and P
2
are proportional (l = 2); then
system (2) is reduced to one of 4 canonical forms: CF
2
1
{ CF
2
4
:
We consider two questions in detail.
1) The renumbering (14) brings any CF
l
i
(of course, if the form is not invariant with respect
to this change) to an additional canonical form CF
lr
i
(see de nition 8) for which principle 5
from the de nition of CF is not hold.
And for l = 2 there exists another variant of additional CF: ACF
2
2
in accordance with re-
mark 19 is obtained from a CF
2
2
with   = 1 by a linear change differing from the renumbering
and has its own ACF
2r
2
:
2) In case of l = 2 if we divide CF
2
2
into two forms depending on the sign of  ; then every
of 5 CF
2
is linearly equivalent to its degenerate CF (see de nition 9). The advantage of DCF
2
is that it has the index lesser than corresponding CF
2
. That easily allows us to investigate
GNF of systems (1) with DCF
2
in unperturbed part. But the absence of P
2
does not allow us
to annul some summands in the perturbation, which is possible for nondegenerate CF if there
are technical tools.

II) The second phase implies that for a system (1) with the unperturbed part CF
l
or
DCF
2
to obtain all the generalized normal forms ( see de nition 4) in explicit form by almost
identical change of variables (3).
In part III this problem has been solved for systems with DCF
2
1
;:::; DCF
2
5
in unperturbed
part.
Since before this article the classi cation of canonical forms introduced in [2, x 2],
where principles 5 and 6 of the de nition of canonical forms were not clearly formulated,
we consider results for other CF
l
i
or their close analogs.
In case of l = 0 systems (1) with the following 4 forms: with CF
0
1
=
 
1 0 0
0 0 1
!
{
in [2, x 6], with CF
0
2
=
 
0 0 1
1 0 0
!
{ in [4, x 11], with CF
0 
4
=
 
1 0 u
 
0 0 1
!
differing
from CF
0
4
=
 
u 0 1
0 0 1
!
by a normalization { in [2,x 6], with CF
0
5
=
 
u 0  
0 1 0
!
; where
  = signu (R< 0); { in [5,x 12] (unfortunately, CF
0
5
with R> 0 have not been revealed
yet) were investigated previously.
In case of l = 1 systems (1) with the following 4 forms: with CF
1
1
=
 
u 0 0
0 1 0
!
{
in [2,x 5], with CF
1
2
=
 
0   0
1 0 0
!
{ in [3,x 8], with CF
1
3
=
 
u 1 0
0 1 0
!
; including u = 1;
{ in [3,x 7], with CF
1
4
=
 
1 0 0
1 1 0
!
{ in [4,x 9] were investigated previously.
Thus, on one of cases two sets of formally equivalent GNF have been obtained. In the  rst
set the unperturbed part is presented by a CF
1
2
with   = 1; and in the second one { by a form
CF
1
3
; but with u = 1; and in accordance with remark 7 these CF are linearly equivalent.
In case of l = 2 systems (1) with the following 3 forms: with CF
2
1
=
 
1 0 0
1 0 0
!
{
in [2, x 4], with ACF
2 
2
=
 
 1  1 0
1 1 0
!
differing from ACF
2
2
=
 
1  1 0
1  1 0
!
by
a normalization { in [4,x 10], with CF
2
4
=
 
0 1 0
0 1 0
!
{ in [2,x 3].
In this situation in 3 cases two sets of formally equivalent GNF were obtained. By theorem 5
DCF
2
i
is linear equivalent to a CF
2
i
(i = 1; 3; 4); DCF
2
2
is equivalent to a CF
2
2
with   = 1
(and ACF
2
2
); and DCF
2
5
is equivalent CF
2
2
with   = 1:
We also note that system (1) investigated in [4,x 10] is up to the present the unique system
in which the unperturbed part has 4 nonzero summands (ACF
2 
2
):
