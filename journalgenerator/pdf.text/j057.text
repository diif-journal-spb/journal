1 Introduction
Let us consider an evolution system of the following type
u
t
= u
3
+ F(u

; v
2
; u
1
; v
1
; u; v); v
t
= G(u
1
; v
1
; u; v); (1)
where F and G are arbitrary functions, u
i
= @
i
u=@x
i
; i = 1; 2; 3; u
t
= @u=@t.
The symmetry classi cation of integrable systems of the type (1) was given in
the article [1]. We folowed there to ideas of the article [2]. But the canonical
conserved densities were obtained by the Chinese algorithm [3]. The list of
integrable systems that was presented in [1] consists of 15 systems. But some
of the systems are connected by the several contact transformations. We write
here the independent integrable systems from the article [1] for completeness:Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2000

Let us mention, that the systems (3), (5) are known as the Drinfeld-Sokolov
systems [4], [5].
We investigate the system (8) in this article.

If we perform the dilatation v ! v=jc

simple form

the system (9)

If we adopt that the matrix U depend on u; v, and the matrix V depend on
u; v; u

, then performing the differentiation in (10) one can easyly obtain

Therefore setting A

constructing a representation of the algebra (13), we found the following explicit

3 Recursion operator and Lie-B acklund symmetries
The recursion operator maps Lie-B acklund algebra of an evolution system into
itself. As we found the matrices (21) that satisfy the equation (10) then we used
the direct algorithm suggested in [10] and developed in [11] for constructing a
recursion operator. The recursion operator of the system (9) takes the following
form
  =

the following formula

can be easily checked. One can  nd the higher
symmetries by the recusrsion formula  
n+1
=

. For example,

The direct calculation shows that the system (9) also admits another sym-
metries:

Hence our system admits the third sequence of Lie-B acklund symmetries: !

is a local vector function and the other vector functions !
i
will be
local probably.
Let us consider the evolution system (u
t
; v
t
) = !
1
. If we set v = 1=w then
this system takes the following simple form
u
t
= 2 " w
1
; w
t
= w
3
(w
3
+ u
1
w + 2 u w
1
): (21)
The second equation can be rewritten as the conservation law (1=w)
t
= ( w w
2
+
w
2
1
=2  u w

)
x
. Hence the following transformation (t; x; u; w)! ( ; y; u
0
; z)
t

= t; dy = w

dx + ( w w
2
+ w

) dt;
u
0
(t
0
; y) = u(t; x); w(t; x) = exp(z(t
0
; y)=2):
(22)
is possible for (21). Performing it we obtain the following new integrable system

where u

Let us mention in conclusion that the operators (15) and (19) are hereditary
operators.

4 Conserved densities and Noether operators
The pair of functions ( ;  ) is called the conserved current of a partial dif-
fetential system with two independent variables t; x and dependent variables
u
ff
; ff = 1; 2; : : :; m, if D
t
 (t; x; u) = D  (t; x; u) for any solution of the system.
The function   is said to be the conserved density and   be the density current.
If we consider the evolution system u
t
= K(u) then gradient of any conserved
density  = E  :

ff
=
X
n
( D)
n

solves the following equation
(D
t
+ K
0
+
) = 0;
where K
0
+
is the adjoint for K
0
operator (see [7], [8] or [9]).
Operator   satisfying the equation
(D
t
  K
0
)  =  (D
t
  K
0
+
) (24)
is called the Noether operator [12].
According to this de nition Noether operator of an evolution system maps
the set of gradients of conserved densities into the set of Lie-B acklund symme-
tries of the system.
We solved the equation (24) and found two following Noether operators for
the system (9):
 
1
=
 
D
3
+ D u + u D v D
D v 0
!
;  
2
=
 
D 0
0 ("=2) D
!
: (25)
The direct check shows that  
1
and  
2
are implectic and compatible (see [12],
[13]). In other words  
1
and  
2
is the Hamiltonian pair. The recursion operator
(15) takes the form   =  
1
 
 1
2
as it can be checked. This formula implies that
  and  
 1
are hereditary operators.
Solving the equation D
t
  = D   one can easyly  nd the following simplest
