Abstract We provide a mathematical development of generalized gauge the-
ory for interactions of an individual particle represented by a complex energy-
density wave-packet 	 in the Minkowski time-space. So, we obtained a general
gauge 4-potential  eld which determinates the acceleration of this particle, by
using the complex phase transformation of 	, generated during any interaction
process, with local symmetry of the Lagrangian density: the Euler-Lagrange
equation derived from this Lagrangian density represents the partial differen-
tial equation of motion of 	.
This developed mathematical theory is then applied for the famous example of
the Aharonov-Bohm effect for the electrons.
Keywords: Interaction Processes, Mathematical gauge theory, Covariant
derivative, Local symmetries, Aharonov-Bohm effect.
1 Basic Equations and Interaction Processes in the IQM
Theory
Quantum mechanics, based on the Schr odinger equation is an epistemic statis-
tical theory, here denominated as Statistical Quantum Mechanics (SQM), to
differentiate it from the new part of the ontological quantum theory, provided
in [5, 6] and [7], denominated Individual particles Quantum Mechanics (IQM).Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2022
Both of them are necessary components of the quantum theory, as are the Clas-
sical Mechanics for Individual objects (ICM),based on the Newton equations,
Hamiltonian-Jacobi equations or the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion of in-
dividual objects) and the Statistical Classical Mechanics (SCM), based on the
Liouville equations.
In the IQM theory there is a deeper speci cation of the state of the particle,
and in this approach to completion provided in [5], these states are speci ed by
the energy-density distributions of a given particle in the Minkowski time-space.
Such an ontic state, also not fully accessible (non fully observable by the mea-
surements, and/or with non accessible small compacti ed higher-dimensions
for the electric charge (5th timelike dimension with the coordinate q

)
and spin (6th spacelike dimension with the coordinate q
5
), for example), has
to represent the complete description of an individual elementary particle, in
order to be able to compute from it all properties of a particle as its rest-mass,
position, speed, momentum, total energy, etc...
It was shown [4, 11, 12, 5, 17] that, generally, any massive particle can be
de ned in the Minkowski time-space (we will not use the real higherdimensional
expressions but only its reduced forms to the 4-D representation) with the
signature (+; ; ; ), by the complex wave-packet

  !
v (t)
at each space-time point (t;
  !
r ) inside particle's matter (where  
m
(t;
  !

As shown in [5], during an inertial propagation when the particle is in a hydro-
static equilibrium, we have that  
m
is spherically symmetric around particle's
barycenter with
  !
u (t;
  !
r ) = 0 in every point inside particle's matter, so that ev-
ery in nitesimal amount of  
m
propagates with the constant wave-packet group
velocity
  !
v . Only during the particle's accelerations we have that
  !
u (t;
  !
r )6= 0,
so that particle's body changes dynamically its shape in time.
In the assumption [5] of the topology of the matter of an elementary massive
particle, the wave-packet do not undergo a spreading, also when it changes its
matter density distribution (i.e., its energy-density  
m
), and tends to its stable
stationary spherically symmetric distribution during inertial propagation in the
vacuum. That is, the matter has some internal self-gravitational autocohesive
force analogously to the peace of perfect uid in the vacuum, so that at any
instance of time, the 3-D space topology of particle's matter distribution, and
consequently its compressible energy-density  
m
is simply connected, closed,
continuous and differentiable.
The Lagrangian densityL of a particle [5], is given by

Thus, each massive elementary particle satis es the following conservation laws:
Analogously to the Euler  rst equation of uid dynamics (continuity equation),
which represents the conservation of mass, here we have the analog equation
for the conservation of matter (that is of the particle's rest-mass energy),

It holds also for bosons when they become unstable after an initial 'space ex-
plosion' and, consequently, assume the massive particle behavior and a  nite
but non-zero energy-density volume in open 3-D space. We need that the body
of the particle  
m
provides also the physical internal pressureP (t;
  !
r ) (which is
a non-geometrical property) in order to guarantee the hydrostatic equilibrium
of the massive particles. The hydrostatic equilibrium of an massive elementary
particle demonstrated that the body of this particle  
m
is a material substance
[10], which is uid and elastic, and which can not be reduced to the time-space
geometry.
Hence, in this IQM theory [5] for individual elementary particles based on
energy-density wave-packets, the point-like particles are only the stable-state
bosons when they propagate with speed of light in the vacuum, and with their
energy-density distributed in higher compacti ed dimensions [6]. In Section 2.7
in [5], dedicated to the 3-D radial expansion of the bosons w.r.t. the direction
of particle's propagation, to the tunneling and reections, has been considered
the cylindrical expansion of the massive boson with energy density  
m
(that is,
during the unstable boson's states where the variation-velocity

Thus, by integration of this hyperdimensional density over 6th dimension
with coordinateq
5
, from [6] we obtain the common point-like 4-D representation
of the massless boson's energy-density in the 4-dimensional Minkowski time-
space by the Dirac function (note that its pilot-wave phase is '

where 1
 
is a constant (equal to a total energy E = pc of a boson in the
frame where the source of this boson is in the rest), which is consequently only
mathematically correct point-like representation of the massless boson. In fact,
now the total energy, for a given time-instancet, can be obtained by integration
in the ordinary 3-D space, by E =

. However, it is not physically correct, because we would have an
in nity density of energy

ct. In such case, the Schwarzschild radius r
s
would be greater (or equal)
than the radius of the point (boson's barycenter) which is zero, so that the
boson would become a black hole, which does not correspond to physical facts.
Note that this fact can't happen in the case when we are using the complete
6-D expression for the wave-packet, where

is also physically composed expression where the energy density is only  (q

and there exists only in the 6th dimension and not inM
4
, and hence the Dirac
'function'   in the Minkowski time-space M

de nes only the position of the
boson and not its energy-density. In effect, by the integration in 6-D time-space
of boson's energy density, its total energy is E =

So, from (7) the volume of the massless boson in the ordinary 3-dimensional
space is equal to zero. Only in such conditions a particle can travel with the
maximal possible speed of light. But the matter/energy of the boson exists
also in such conditions: it is uniformly distributed only in the spacelike sixth
dimension (used for the spin) where it propagates with a constant speed v
5
.
Consequently, the hidden matter of a boson in the compacti ed higher dimen-
sions results in zero rest-mass in the ordinary at Minkowski time-space and
explains why the boson can propagate with maximal possible speed. During
this massless stable-state, the gravitational anti-black-hole barrier acting in the
boson's barycenter (in 3-D space) does not permit the leaking of the matter
from 6th into ordinary 3-dimensional space.
We consider the vacuum as the perfect 3-dimensional space symmetry where
each possible direction of the propagation has the same physical conditions.
Thus, the propagation of the particles in the vacuum is inertial and the par-

ticle propagates along GR geodesics with constant speed as a stable particle
1
.
The asymmetry due to the presence of an in nitesimal inertial particle in at
Minkowski spacetime is purely circumstantial, because the spacetime is consid-
ered to be unaffected by the presence of this particle. However, according to
general relativity, the presence of any inertial entity disturbs the symmetry of
the manifold even more profoundly, because it implies an intrinsic curvature of
the spacetime manifold, i.e., the manifold takes on an intrinsic shape that dis-
tinguishes the location and rest frame of the particle. Note that, from the fact
that the stable bosons have no matter/energy in the ordinary 3-dimensional
(open) space, the stable bosons do not generate any local time-space curva-
ture, differently from the fermions. Thus, the local time-space neighborhood
of a massless boson is always a locally at Minkowski time-space, differently
from the fermions (and also unstable massive bosons). The fact that the sta-
ble bosons have no any curved island-metrics in the ordinary 4-dimensional
time-space, results in missing of any physical resistance of the neighborhood
time-space to their propagation (differently from the massive particles with
energy-density present in the 4-dimensional time-space and, generated from it,
curved micro-island metrics). Consequently, they propagate with maximal pos-
sible speed in the ordinary 4-dimensional time-space. Thus, the bosons have the
point-like 4-dimensional structure corresponding to their position (barycenter),
but physically their total energy-density is

But there are the situations when a stable, stationary, boson becomes ex-
cited for a short interval of time, as in the situations when the space symmetry
during its propagation is sharply broken. Thus, the time-space boundary condi-
tions for the particle's propagation are drastically changed, by considering that
particle's wave-packet is a time-space perturbation and, if such a perturbation
meets another perturbation, it changes its form. These events we analyzed in
details for the phenomena of refraction and 'wave-behaviors' of an individual
photon [5]. In all these situations a photon may change its momentum, direc-
tion of propagation and its velocity, without changing its total energy, because
these 'interactions' are not based on collisions with another particles (as Comp-
ton effects, or annihilations), but on instantaneous 3-D space expansions of their
geometric wave-packet scalar  eld   in the presence of a local sharply broken
space symmetry. These are strong General Relativity effects correlated with
the particle's 'micro-island' curvature metrics, caused by a dynamical changing
of the boundary conditions in the local space around this particle.

Example 1 The breaking of 3-D pace-symmetry for massless bosons and their
transformation into massive bosons (short-range bosons) and derived theory of
clouds of short-range photons generated by electrically charged particles that
generate the electromagnetic  eld is provided in [17].
In order to generate a static electric  eld around a single charged fermion
(as electron, for example), the short-range massive photons must be constantly
emitted in all radial directions from this charged fermion, so that the number
N >> 1 of emitted photons must be very high at each  xed instance of time.
However, in order to maintain the constant energy-level of the charged fermion,
it means that practically all of irradiated short-range photons will come back to
be absorbed by the same fermion. So, the total emitted energy from a charged
fermion corresponds to the total absorbed energy of the same fermion.
Moreover, in [17] we explained that such a cloud of emmitted/absorbed short-
range photons around any charged particle, generates the electromagnetic 4-
potential (gauge  eld),

The physical origin of the continuous emission of short-range photons from
charged particles is explained in [7], Section 5.1.2, based on the Kaluza-Klein
theory of the small compacti ed time-like 5th dimension (generating electric
charge of particle by propagation of particle's energy-density in this closed di-
mension).
The interactions between any two wave-packets (particles) can be obtained only
by their local collisions. In dependence on their energy and velocities, they can
produce a kind of Compton's effects (elastic collisions) in which they survive
the collisions by changing their momentum and energy (with the conservation
of total momentum and energy), or they can produce a total fusion with a
possible creation of the new stable particles (in Feynman's diagrams).
Thus, for any two massless bosons with the Dirac function energy-
distributions, it is impossible to have the collisions during their stable states,

but only when they are excited and involved in their temporary 3-D "spatial
explosions". Such 3-D spatial explosions can happen also when two stable
particles are at a very small mutual distance, during which the ideal spatial
symmetry for a free particle in the vacuum does not hold more for both of
them. The bosons have a physical role as the intermediators between the mas-
sive particles (that have the rest-mass and the 3-D volumeV
t
greater than zero),
that is, they are a quantum-source that generates the  elds (the phenomena
as electromagnetic  elds are the statistical results of actions of a high number
of photons). In the case when the bosons are massless (long range interactions
as for massless photons) then we have no the signi cant interference between
themselves. This situation can be obtained at the quantum level only if the col-
lisions between photons, for example, are practically improbable. Consequently,
a number of photons can coexist in the same small 3-D region of space without
any signi cant direct interference between them, heaving contemporarily the
collisions with fermions which have the rest-mass and volume V
t
greater than
zero. Also in such a situation, we can have the rare cases of the interference
between the photons. In normal situations, these interferences statistically can
be neglected, while in the cases of very strong  eld interactions (when the local
density of photons is extremely high) these inter-boson's interactions are sig-
ni cant. Thus, we have the following assumption:
Interaction-dynamics Assumption: The interactions between the bosons
and fermions are realized always between two non-point like particles. That
is, between a massive fermion and a massive unstable boson with a small but
 nite energy-density volume V

2 Introduction to Gauge Invariance: Local Symmetries
A key innovation of the 20th century was Herman Weyl's invention of gauge
theory, in which a global physical symmetry is replaced by a local one; the arbi-
trary phase in Hamiltonian-based quantum wave function becomes a function
of time-space, a change that requires the existence of the electromagnetic gauge
 eld. Weyl's gauge method, where the global symmetry is transformed into a lo-
cal one, applied to the Standard-Model symmetry groupSU(3) SU(2) U(1),
is enough in the SQM theory to yield the strong, weak and electromagnetic in-
teractions.
It is well known the relativistic invariance or Poincare symmetry and the
internal symmetry based on the Lie group U(1) symmetry of phase transfor-

mations (the conservation of matter and, dually, of electric charge for Dirac
equation). Analogously, we can consider the isospin symmetry SU(2) (used
for the electroweak force interactions) and the avour symmetry SU(3) of the
strong force interactions. All of them are continuous global symmetry trans-
formations (they give rise to conserved currents and charges as described by
Noether's theorem, that is, they presuppose that, at least in principle, we can
measure all the components of a  eld 	 at all points
  !
r in space at the same
time.
However, here we have to consider the theories which are invariant if the
symmetry operations are performed locally where the transformation parame-
ters are dependent on local space coordinates (for example, if the rotation angle
  of Lorentz transformation is not constant for all in nitesimal pieces of matter
 
m
= 		, but is dependent on its space position
  !
r , that is, the rotation angle
is a function  (
  !
r )). A gauge theory is a theory where the action is invariant
under a continuous group symmetry that depends on time-space and such local
symmetries introduce these gauge  elds to the theory which mediate a force.
Let us consider, for instance, the internal phase transformation, when   is not
a constant phase, but depends on space position
  !
r , and when we require that
the Lagrangian densityL in equation (3) be invariant under such local smooth
changes of phase:

0
j
(t;
  !
r )
= e
i (
  !
r )
	j
(t;
  !
r )
(10)
However, since the Lagrangian densityL is invariant under global internal sym-
metry when  is constant, it is not invariant under local phase transformations
given by (10). The problem is that the derivatives of the  eld 	 does not
transform like the  eld in (10). In fact we have for j = 1; 2; 3 that:

If we want to consider the phase transformations  (
  !
r ) that differ from a point
to point, we have to de ne a connection that speci es the mode how we suppose
to transport the phase of 	 from r

geometry, the vector  eld 	 are not vectors in the tangent space (plane) of a
manifold, but belong to an "internal" vector spaceV (like isospin, avor, etc..)
and hence the local transformation (10) can be considered as a time-space

We require that the physics do not depend on the local choice of the basis,

Minimal Coupling. Thus, we can make a system invariant under local gauge
transformation at the expense of introducing a gauge vector  eld, which de nes
in a given point p = r

the 4-vector A(r

), that plays the role of connection.
This procedure, that relates the matter  eld (of a particle) and gauge  eld
(by which this particle interacts) through the covariant derivative is known as
'minimal coupling'.
3 Uni ed IQM Gauge Theory for Individual Particles
Let us consider how such a kind of localization of the internal phase transfor-
mation is supported by the particle's matter/energy-density wave-packet which
propagates with an arbitrary acceleration in a given locally at Minkowski ref-
erence frame; we want to derive a general gauge  eld which is a source of such
an acceleration of this particle. That is, the gauge theory provided in this
section represents the uni cation of the three basic forces of the nature: elec-
tromagnetic, weak and strong forces. This is done by the general complex local
phase transformation  (t;
  !
r ) =  
R
(t) +i 
I
(t;
  !
r ) valid for each of these three
basic forces.

In hopes of duplicating the success of the standard model, general relativity (which is non-renormalizable)
was also formulated as a local gauge theory [24]. A Poincare transformation thet consists of constants and effects
all of space instantly is called a global transformation: in GR such transformations violates special relativity,
since such transformation takes us from one inertial reference frame to another, and, in presence of gravity,
reference frames will be accelerated so that would be possible to have the information transmitted faster than
the speed of light!

Uni ed Local Symmetry. Let us consider the evolution of the parti-
cle's wave-packet 	    (t;
  !
r )e
 i'
T
from initial time-instance t to another
	
0
   (t + t;
  !
r )e
 i'
T
j
(t+ t)
at a time-instance t + t > t, in a given  eld of
(combination of) basic forces. We would like to express this evolution as the re-
sult of the local phase transformation  (t;
  !
r ), that is, by 	7! 	
0
= e
i  (t;
  !
r )
	.
We assume that  t is an in nitesimal amount of time during which a particle
has the interaction with only one boson of the  eld so that, after this interac-
tion, this particle changed its velocity momentum and energy and its phase for
a small amount   . Hence, this local phase transformation  (t;
  !
r ) is complex
(differently from the usual theory for the point-like particles). The fact that this
complex local phase transformation is a local symmetry for this particle holds
from the fact that both 	 and 	
0
are the solutions of the same LagrangianL
for the  eld 	 only at two different instances of time.
Thus, by substitution of 	
0
  e
i (t;
  !
r )
	 intoL we obtain the same La-
grangian form, that is, we obtain thatL is invariant under this local phase
transformation. This complex local phase transformation supports any kind
of basic forces or their combinations and hence mathematically represents the
uni cation of these basic forces.
 
For a free particle (without any external  eld that inuence its propagation) we
obtain the case when the external gauge  eld is zero, that is, when A(r
4
) = 0.
In the case when we have some external gauge  eld (i.e., the total  eld which
can be represented by a sum of different types of the  elds as well) A(r
4
)6= 0
which inuences the propagation of a particle (without annihilation of this
particle), with Lagrangian density denoted byL
gauge
. The total Lagrangian
densityL =L
free
+L
gauge
is given by equation in (3), where the gauge  eld
is indirectly represented by the matter-density speed
  !
w(r
4
) =
  !
v (t) +
  !
u (r
4
),
where
  !
v (t) is the speed of particle's barycenter which changes in time (the
accelerations and matter-density speed are the direct results of the interaction
of a particle with this external gauge  eld A(r
4
)).
Consequently, any local phase transformation 	7! 	
0
= e
i (
  !
r )
	 transforms
the matter-density speed
  !
w(r
4
) and, consequently, the particle's trajectory,
accelerations and momentum/energy. This mathematical consequence explains
that the local phase changing of the phase indeed means that we have some
gauge  eld which modi es the original (free particle) particle's trajectory, speed
and momentum/energy. Thus, in what follows, we will use the general local
phase transformations  (r
4
) = (t;
  !
r ).

w(t;

above and the Lagrangian of the introduced gauged
 eld A
 
, which interacts with the previously free particle and determines its
 nal trajectory, speed and momentum/energy.
Let us consider the properties of the general gauge  led A
 
(the resulting
combination of all forces acting on this moving particle) and its effect on the
propagation of a given particle which at a given instance of time t has a given
speed
  !
v and a given momentum/energy. If we would eliminate the gauge
 eld (external force), then this particle would continue to propagate with this
constant speed as a free particle with the Lagrangian densityL
free
. But if we
do not eliminate this gauge  eld then, after an in nitesimal amount of time
t
0
= t + t, it will change its speed and hence the Lagrangian density will be
equal to that of accelerated particles in equation (17) where

w =

Consequently, the gauge Lagrangian is obtained by

which is invariant for the local phase transformations. Hence, from (19), also

must is invariant for the local phase transformations, as
expected.
Remark: Note that in this approximative derivation of the gauge Lagrangian,
we considered only the pilot-wave changing of the particle and not also of its
density   distribution, that is, the method of derivation ofL
gauge
was as for a
point-like particle, and because of that we obtained from (20) that    is a real
amount. If we consider also that during  t changes the energy-density

as
well, then we have to assume that   is a complex value in the gauge Lagrangian

L
gauge
. That is, for the non point-like massive particles the gauge Lagrangian
L
gauge
in (21) is valid only for the complex values   , as it will be shown.
 
Now we have to understand if the componentsA
j
of this gauge Lagrangian are
independent variables, as it is so if we de ne the gauge  eld independently of the
particle's  eld 	, or not. The answer is no. In fact, in our approach the gauge
Lagrangian is derived from the particle's Lagrangian densities for two possible
particle's states: when it is free particle and when it is not. Thus the gauge
 eld A
 
is derived indirectly from the particle's behavior. Here we have the
 nal behavior of a particle (its trajectory, velocity, accelerations, momentum-
energy changes, etc...) and after that we analyze the properties of the gauge
 eld which caused such a particular particle's behavior (which is a resulting
effect of a number of different fundamental forces as electromagnetic, weak,
strong). Hence, the total gauge  eld is derived from this concrete particle's
behavior, that is, from its  eld 	. Consequently, in this framework, we have
the gauge Lagrangian dependent only on two variables, so that, from (21), it
can be expressed byL
gauge
(	; 	).
The second consideration is that the gauge Lagrangian (21) does not cor-
respond exactly to the real situation because the  elds 	 =  e
 i'
T
(where  
is a real density distribution function) used inL andL
I
free
in equation (19) are
different not only in the pilot-wave phases but also in the densities  , and hence
(21) can be used only for the massive but point-like bosons. In effect, from the
fact that the interactions of the observed massive particle are always with the
unstable (massive) bosons, it means that the term in (21) in front of 		 must
be a real value.
However, if we want to use (21) for 	 that are not point-like massive par-
ticles, then we need to use the complex  eldsA
j
instead of real, in order to
obtain that such complex  elds compensate the fact that the observed particle's
density   inL and inL
I
free
are slightly different also for in nitesimal  t.
In fact, let us consider an in nitesimal phase transformation for a real
amount   
R
> 0 during an in nitesimal amount of time  t > 0 of the ob-
served massive particle which, at a time instancet  0, is given by the complex
 eld (particle's wave-packet) 	j
(t;
  !
r )
=  (t;

.

Then, for the changing of the density  , we may always de ne the real function:
  
I
(t;
  !
r ) 
(
 ln(
 (t+ t;

 (t;

; if  (t + t;

0 , otherwise
(22)
Note that natural logarithm is always well de ned for particle's barycenter,
where
  !
r =

r
T
(t), for an in nitesimal  t. So, from
@

 t
and
 t
 (t;

@ (t;

Consequently, the changing of the particle's wave-packet satis es local

	 where   (t;

(23)
So, for the non point-like massive particle expressed by the  eld 	, we need to

This result shows that in this mathematical framework, the gauge  eld
properties are not determined in all time-space points, but exclusively in the
time-space points of the particle's barycenter, that is, on its trajectory

(t).
Let us show that it is indeed so.
Indeed, let us consider the invariant free LagrangianL

in (18) and show
that it corresponds to the general LagrangianL restricted only on the particle's

trajectory time-space points. Thus, we have to show that analogously toL = 0,
L
I

= 0. It is enough to verify that from (24) and (21),L
gauge
= 0, so that
from (19),L
I
free
=L L
gauge
= 0  0 = 0. Let us show now thatL
I
free
is
just the reduction ofL to the time-space points on the particle's trajectory.
In fact, in LagrangianL
I

given by (18), in the place of
  !
w we have the
speed of barycenter
  !
v , and what we need is only to show that the component

In effect, it holds from (20), so that the LagrangianL
I

, for the in nites-
imal phase transformations, can be equivalently written as follows,
L

(	; 	) =

which is a reduction of the general Lagrangian for accelerated particlesL in
(17) only to the time-space points of the particle's trajectory, where w

,
j = 1; 2; 3.
Note that this is a general result for any possible combination of the external

depend on the particular case of the gauge  elds. Let us now determine this
parameter and, after that, the values that must have the general gauge 4-vector
 eld A on the trajectory of the particle.
Let us consider the changing of the  eld 	 on the trajectory points (t;

in (20) caused by an in nitesimal local complex-phase transformation    =

trajectory. Thus for  t! 0, we obtain

It seems a natural choice that the scalar componentA

determines particle's total energy (or Hamiltonian), while the vector gauge

determines particle's canonical momentum.
In fact, the imaginary component of the scalar gauge potential Im(A

particle's shape   during interaction of the particle with intermediary bosons
(gauge  eld). It is easy to verify (we can extend its validity from the particle's
barycenter also for any point

r from the fact that
  !
u (t;

That is, the total time derivative of particle's rest-mass energy density

determined by the imaginary component of scalar gauge potentialA

this generalization, we can de ne the gauge 4-potential also for the positions

potential A
 
= 0, as expected in the at Minkowski time-space (there is no
any interaction of this massless boson with another bosons during its stable
Dirac function state when propagates with the speed of light in the vacuum
along the GR geodesics). Only if this boson becomes unstable massive boson
(by the presence of another material objects on its trajectory) then it can have
an interaction with another particles and change its trajectory, as it happens
for the fermions.
Now, from (24) and (31), we obtain that

Remark: In our working framework, where we determine the (composed) gauge
 eld only from the particle's behaviour (dominantly from its trajectory), it is
an expected result, because based only on the observation of the particle's
trajectory, mathematically we are not able to determine the values of the gauge
 led in the time-space points different from the particle's trajectory. That is,
we are able to derive acting forces on the particle only in the time-space points
of the particle's trajectory, that is in the barycenter of the particle.

But this is not a particular side-effect of this completion of the Quantum
Mechanics, based on the  eld 	 of the matter/energy-density wave-packet of
an elementary particle, but a fundamental new result: it creates a strong conti-
nuity between a 'macroscopic' classical mechanics and 'microscopic' Quantum
Mechanics. This continuity is based on the fact that gauge  elds acts on the
particle's barycenter with the produced forces which determine and modify the
original free particle trajectory.
It is well known that the standard Quantum Mechanics and its gauge theory
is based on the energy considerations and wavefunctions based on the Hamilto-
nian energy-levels, as in Schr odinger, Klein-Gordon or Dirac equations, and on
their Lagrangian densities which de ne the interactions of a free particle with
external forces by an explicit introduction of the particular gauge  eld.
The second new result of this dual approach used in this completion of
QM is that here the general Lagrangian density of the accelerated particle's
wave-packet contains implicitly the gauge  eld, whose effects on the particle
are visible in the behavior of the general Lagrangian density, that is, in its
Euler-Lagrangian equation of motion. This is a similar approach to that used
by Johannes Kepler, for example, to establish that the orbit of a planet is an
ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci, and after that by Newton to explain
that the 'gauge  eld' that determines such orbits must satisfy his own laws
of motion and law of universal gravitation (the direction of the acceleration is
towards the Sun and the magnitude of the acceleration is in inverse proportion
to the square of the distance from the Sun).
 
Let us show how the parallel transport at  nite distances works, along a par-
ticle's path (of the particle barycenter) from the initial point r

at the time-instance t, into the  nal point r

= (t

=t +4t, for any  nite time interval4t> 0. From the fact that the parallel
transport along a  nite particle's trajectory (r

integrated and hence, from (24), we have that

Notice that this result (38) can be obatiend directly by integration of in nites-

Moreover, the interaction of a particle with an external  eld boson cnages only
locally particle's density   mainly in particle's surface, so that the density in
particle's barycenter (which is maximal possible density

does not change
during the interactions (emission/absorbtion) of bosons, and the speed of this
invariant particle's denisity in its barucenter is equal to particle's speed

Conclusions: We have seen that the general Lagrangian density of a particle
is the addition of a Lagrangian density of this particle in its perfect stationary
(free particle) state and a total gauge  eld (as a combination of a number
of existent quantum  elds), which can be observed on the particles barycenter
(trajectory). That is, like in the standard quantum gauge  eld theory where the
particles are considered as point-like objects. We are able to use the standard
gauge  eld theory also in the constructive way (as in the standard quantum
mechanics) by considering a Lagrangian densityL
free
of the free particle (that
propagates with a constant speed) by adding to it a speci c gauge Lagrangian.
In both cases, the point-like approximation for the particles is well suited for
the interactions of a particle with the gauge  elds. Thus, this new theory of QM
(the IQM theory), based on the non point-like massive particle that propagates
as wave-packets of a given invariant amount of matter, distributed in a small
but  nite volume, is a conservative extension of the standard point-like based
quantum mechanics for the particles. But for the high-energy physics, where the
annihilation and creation of the new particles are dominant, the interactions
of the non point-like particles introduce the direct collisions of their matter-
densities, which produce the forces that are not based only on the bosons (also
in their unstable states when they have the properties of the 'virtual particles')
of the gauge  elds.
A local symmetry can be connected also to indeterminism because of the
time dependence of its transformation parameter. For example, the time depen-
dence of a transformation for a local symmetry will ensure that a transforma-
tion can have the initial and  nal con gurations invariant, while transforming
the history between those two points. Thus for the local U(1) symmetry with
 (t;
  !
r ), this can be theoretically achieved if the parameter  (t;
  !
r ) vanishes at
the initial and  nal times, t
i
and t
f
, for every
  !
r , while it has non-zero value
at at least one point
  !
r for a time t, for which t
i
<t<t
f
. Since such a trans-
formation is a symmetry of the theory, the transformed history will extremize
the action for the same initial and  nal con gurations and hence a theory with

a local symmetry can thus be indeterministic.
Notice that this is not possible in our case, because from equation (38) for
a limit4t7! 0 around this time-instance t we always have that lim
4t7!0
  = 0.
That is, we can not have at t the value of  6= 0 if the initial  (r
4
) and  nal
 (r
0
4
) con gurations are the same, so that ln(
 (r
0
4
)
 (r
4
)
) = 0. Consequently, in our
case there is no more than one realizable history for a given initial and  nal
con guration of the  eld 	, and hence our system is deterministic and these
local symmetries must be necessarily the gauge symmetries.
4 Example: Aharonov-Bohm Effect
The most commonly described case, sometimes called the Aharonov-Bohm
solenoid effect, takes place when the wave function of a charged particle pass-
ing around a long solenoid experiences a phase shift as a result of the enclosed
magnetic  eld, despite the magnetic  eld being negligible in the region through
which the particle passes and the particle's wavefunction being negligible inside
the solenoid.
It is sometimes called the Ehrenberg-Siday-Aharonov-Bohm effect,  rst
predicted the effect in 1949 by Werner Ehrenberg and Raymond Siday [1].
Aharonov-Bohm effect was  rst described in 1959 in an article [2], written by
Yakir Aharonov and his doctoral advisor David Bohm and received various re-
sponses. The Aharonov-Bohm effect is important conceptually because it bears
on three issues apparent in the recasting of (Maxwell's) classical electromag-
netic theory as a gauge theory, which before the advent of quantum mechanics
could be argued to be a mathematical reformulation with no physical conse-
quences. In fact, when developing their idea, Aharonov and Bohm consulted
experimental physicist Robert G.Chambers and in their article, they described
the experiment which had to be carried out to prove their theory. Only a year
later [3], in 1960, Chambers performed the proposed experiment and proved
that effect does exist. In following years, effect was con rmed by more and
more precise experiments.
The Aharonov-Bohm effect shows that the local electric
  !
E and magnetic
  !
B
forces do not contain full information about the electromagnetic  eld, and the
electromagnetic 4-potential vector, (
 (t;
  !
r )
c
;
  !
A(t;
  !
r )) in (8) with (9), must be
used instead. By Stokes' theorem, the magnitude of the Aharonov-Bohm effect
can be calculated using the electromagnetic  elds alone, or using the 4-potential
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru 164Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2022
alone. But when using just the electromagnetic  elds, the effect depends on the
 eld values in a region from which the test particle is excluded. In contrast,
when using just the electromagnetic four-potential, the effect only depends on
the potential in the region where the test particle is allowed. Therefore, one
must either abandon the principle of locality, which most physicists (and me)
are reluctant to do, or accept that the electromagnetic 4-potential offers a more
complete description of electromagnetism than the electric and magnetic forces
can.
My opinion [17] is that the electric and magnetic forces are only derived ef-
fects of the fundamental electromagnetic phenomena based on the 4-potentials
(which are the statistical results of the interaction produced by high number
of photons as intermediators between charged massive particles). This vision
of the electromagnetic phenomena is compatible with the vision of gravitation
phenomena based on the fundamental concept of the time-space curvature, that
is, on the gravitational potential (metrics), where the gravitational acceleration
force
  !
g is a derived effect (in the case of the Newton's gravitation approxi-
mation, this force is just equal to the gradient of the gravitational potential,
similarly to the electric force which is proportional to the gradient of the scalar
potential   in (9). So, from the fact that
  !
E and
  !
B are derived forces, we can
also have the 3-D regions where we have the photons (thus 4-potential different
from zero) but with zero electromagnetic  elds
  !
E =
  !
B = 0, as in the case of
the scalar Tesla's waves (composed by massive photons) considered in [17].
Let us now consider a long solenoid, carrying magnetic  eld
  !
B . If solenoid
is ideal (i.e. in nitely long and with a perfectly uniform current distribution),
the  eld
  !
B inside is uniform and the  eld outside is zero. We will use cylindrical
coordinate system (r; ;z) withz axis in the middle of solenoid and pointing in
direction of magnetic  eld.
Thus, we consider the case when outside the solenoid   = 0 while, from

In the case when we send a coherent beam of electrons toward this solenoid,
these massive bosons around solenoid interact with the electrons of this beam by
changing their direction of propagation, momentum and energy (Hamiltonian
is changed by the 4-potential, that is by the interaction with massive bosons).
This model can be used as the physical explanation of the Aharonov-Bohm
effect, based on the massive photons (the intermediate bosons of the electro-
magnetic 4-potential  eld) interacting with the coherent beam of electrons (see
 gure 1). Thus, the electrons passing near to the solenoid have the interactions
with these massive photons, so that these interactions change the trajectory,
momentum vector, and energy (Hamiltonian) of each electron in the beam and
explain the interference between left and right (around the solenoid) beams of
electrons. The right beam trajectory is parallel to
  !
A (at the point of closest
approach), while the left beam trajectory is antiparallel. Even in the absence
of any Lorentz force on the electrons, these interactions produce a phase shift
between the complex wave-packets 	 of the electrons in the right w.r.t. the left
beams.
For any contracted curve around the solenoidC with the surfaceS, from the
Stokes theorem we have that (consider that we adopted positive-time Minkowski

Magnetic Aharonov-Bohm effect: Let us now consider the phase-shift
Aharonov-Bohm effects on the left and right beams of electrons in Figure 1:
two electrons (one in left and other in the right beam) traveling together (in
parallel) with the same velocity
  !
v pass by the solenoid on opposite sides.
At the point of closest approach to the solenoid, one is traveling parallel to

A(r; ) =A

on its side, the other antiparallel. So, the pilot-wave of each
wave-packet (

and

known as the magnetic Aharonov-Bohm phase shift. We consider that from

Note that such a transformation from the Schr odinger wavefunction (a state vector in Hilbert space)
when the solenoid is off to the state 
0
= e
i 
R
when the solenoid is on, from my point of view seems non
correct, because we know that each state in SQM remains equal if we change only the phase of it. Consequently,
in the SQM, we have that both and 
0
correspond to the same quantum state of the electron. This is in
contradiction with the fact that the state of the electron, when the solenoid is off, must be different from
the state 
0
when the solenoid is on, and hence they would have different trajectories depending if solenoid
is off or on. So, also the probability density to  nd this electron (described by these two wavefunctions) at
a given point, instead to be equal,

t = 0 (when the beam of electrons is split in the left and right-hand side com-
ponents) to t> 0 (when the left and right beams are recombined, see  gure 1)
these two considered electrons traveling together de ned two paths

respectively, such that

So, if we change magnetic  eld in solenoid, we change phase difference between
beams and interference pattern will shift. Aharonov and Bohm suggested how
it could be measured by heaving electron waves traversing the two paths inter-
fere with each other. Achieving interference patterns requires that the initial
electron beam be adequately coherent and that its splitting maintain that co-
herence. The former is accomplished by having a well-collimated beam with
narrow spreads in angle and particle energy, and later requires something like
a diffraction grating or an electromagnetic biprism.
4.1 Uni ed IQM Gauge Theory for Aharonov-Bohm effects
By considering that IQM theory is classical deterministic part of the quan-
tum theory, also in classical electrodynamics theory this Aharonov-Bohm effect
there exists, and not only in the statistical quantum mechanics based on the
probabilistic wavefunction (with the ensemble interpretation). In our case, in
IQM theory, an individual electron is not point-like but is composed by its 3-D
body of rest-mass density  
m
(t;
  !
r ) =  
2
(t;
  !
r ). During the interaction with
the  eld
  !
A (that is, with massive photons which are the intermediate bosons
of this  eld), the rest-mass energy density of the electron is changed as well, so
that for the modi ed electron's wave-packet

(t;

 i'

T
e
 iff
H
6= 	 e

R
,
because  
0
(t;
  !
r )6=  (t;
  !
r ). In fact, the interaction of an individual massive
particle (an electron in our case) and external  elds (
  !
A in our case) in the IQM
theory is de ned in the uni ed gauge theory [7], based on the local symmetry
(a kind of localization of the internal phase transformations for the electrons's
accelerated complex wave-packet 	).
So, we will use now this Aharonov-Bohm experiment as an example, to which
we can apply this new gauge theory, with the following property:
Let us consider the evolution of the particle's wave-packet 	   (t;
  !
r )e
 i'
H
T
,
from initial time t to another

   (t + t;

j
(t+ t)
at a time-instance
t + t>t, in a given external  eld (a combination of basic forces). We would
like to express this evolution as the result of the local phase transformation
  (t;
  !
r ), that is, by 	7! 	
0
= e
i  (t;
  !
r )
	. We assume that t is an in nitesimal
amount of time during which a particle has the interaction with only one boson

of the external  eld. Thus, after this interaction, this particle changed its ve-
locity, momentum, energy, and hence its phase for a small amount   . So, this
local phase transformation (t;
  !
r ) = 
R
(t;
  !
r )+i 
I
(t;
  !
r ) is complex, differently
from the SQM theory for the point-like particles (where it is a real value).
In the gauge theory of the IQM presented in Section 3, we derived the gauge La-

and from this we see the fundamental physical difference between the general
IQM gauge 4-potential A
 
and electromagnetic 4-potential A

: when the elec-
tromagnetic 4-potential is zero, the gauge 4-potential becomes constant (differ-
ent from zero) and continues to govern particle's inertial propagation as well.
That is, the gauge 4-potential always determine particle's pilot-wave phase also
in the intervals of time when particle is free.
Thus, from equation (38) in Proposition 1,

Hence, the uni ed gauge theory of IQM is in perfect accordance with classical
electrodynamics. Note that in the de Broglie pilot-wave phase, the total energy
is equal to the Hamiltonian and the momentum is canonical.
 
In addition, the classical Maxwell equations are derived from QED scatter-
ing process while both classical electromagnetic  elds and potentials serve as
mathematical tools that are constructed to approximate the interactions among
elementary particles described by QED physics, i.e., neither classical  elds nor
potentials represent any real entities of nature.
The vector potentials ( ;
  !
A) as well as EM  eld are nothing but mathematical
idealisations that approximate the interactions among electrons which are me-
diated by the photons, as it has been shown in [17], the EM  eld will come into
play in classical theory since they comprise major parts of the Lorentz force
equation. Now it is clear that, in the Aharonov-Bohm effect, it does not matter
whether the EM  elds are zero or not in the region where the beam of electrons
can enter, the underlying mechanism is the interactions between this beam of
electrons and the  eld
  !
A, while such interactions are mediated by massive pho-
tons. Moreover, the Maxwell's EM  elds are not produced directly by electrons
or any hypothetical magnetic monopoles, they serve as calculation tools and
emerge in the classical world because of the coupling effect between charged
particles with photons. We can regard the classical four-potential ( ;
  !
A) as
well as EM  eld as mathematical statistical manifestations of photons. There
is no any 'nonlocal feature' in an Aharonov-Bohm experiment: its effect can
be interpreted as the manifestation of massive photons propagating between
electrons in the framework of the IQM theory.
As it was shown in [17], the electromagnetic phenomena and forces are achieved
trough the basic phenomena of emission and absorption of the long/short-range
photons by the charged particles. So, also Lorentz force is the statistical effect
of this phenomena of emission and absorption of the long/short-range photons
by the charged particle.
Thus, we can have the particular cases when the 4-potential  eld ( ;
  !
A) there
exists, mediated by massive and slow photons, in which the Maxwell's electro-
magnetic  elds
  !
E and
  !
B are zero and the Lorentz force consequently is zero,
but still there is another force that these massive photons generate on an elec-
tron, based on their mutual collisions in which these massive photons transfer
their momentum to this electron.
It is just the case of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, because for  =
@
  !
A
@t
=r 
  !
A =
0 we obtain, from (61), that the Lorentz force
  !
F is zero. However, in the late
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru 174Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2022
1990's, a quantum force was predicted for the Aharonov-Bohm physical system
by Shelankov [18], and elucidated by Berry [19]. That this (non-Lorentz) force
is indeed present is demonstrated a number of times [20]. For experiments with
electron beams, the presence of a longitudinal force along the beam can lead
to time delays, while a transverse force leads to deections. The absence of a
longitudinal force, as made apparent by the absence of electron time delays, has
been investigated more recently. The deection, another indicator of force, is
accompanied by a characteristic asymmetry in the electron diffraction pattern.
In order to understand the underlying physical nature of these non-Lorentz
forces, we have to analyze the consequences of the Maxwell equations in the
case of the Aharonov-Bohm effects.
So, if we replace the equations (9) into the ordinary Maxwell equations for the
electric and magnetic  elds
  !
E and
  !
B , we obtain the following equations for
the electromagnetic 4-potential in the region outside the solenoid for r > r
0
,
where   = 0 and current
  !
j = 0:
 r

@
@t
(r 
  !
A) = 0; ( r

2
@t
2
)
  !
A +r(r 
  !
A +
1
c
2
@ 
@t
) = 0 (68)
From the fact that, in our case, the voltage potential is   = 0, we have no any
scalar wave for  , differently from the case analyzed in [17] for Tesla's scalar
waves. So, we need to investigate if we have the vector
  !
A (radiation) waves.
Notice that, in our case, it holds not only Coulomb gauge potential condition
r 
  !
A = 0 but also the Lorentz gauge potential conditionr 
  !
A +
1
c
2
@ 
@t
= 0.
Thus, the system of two equations (68) is reduced only to the vector-potential
wave equation:
( r
2
+
1
c
2
@
2
@t
2
)
  !
A = 0 (69)
Hence, if it would be a non trivial identity with zero, then we would have that
the vector potential  eld
  !
A is mediated by the long-range photons which are
emitted from the accelerated electrons in the solenoid (we recall that also if
the speed of free electrons in the solenoid's current is constant, from the fact
that their orbit in the solenoid is a circle, all electrons in the solenoid's current
have a constant acceleration with direction toward the center of the solenoid)
and then become massless photons able to propagate by the speed of light as a
cylindrical wave.
Let us show that this is not the case here, so that the mediated bosons for
the  eld
  !
A are massive and slow short-range photons [17], which generate the
electrostatic  eld of each electron (in its rest-frame).
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru 175Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2022
So, let us show that (69) is not the wave equation of massless photon's prop-
agation with the speed of light. Let us control its  rst term with Laplacian
operator, given in the solenoids cylindrical coordinate system with the center
in the center of solenoid,

Also the second time-derivation component of the wave-equation (69) is equal
to zero, because the vector
  !
A is time-invariant, and hence this wave equation
does not represent the propagation of the massless photons with the speed of
light. Thus, the intermediators for the vector-potential  eld
  !
A can only be the
massive and slow short-range photons, irradiated by electrons in the solenoid.
Let us show that the non-wave vector potential
  !
A(r; ) = A
 
(r)e
 
, given in
this cylindrical coordinate system with the center in the center of the solenoid,
outside this solenoid (for r > r
0
, where r
0
is the radius of the solenoid) is
really the statistical consequence of the short-range photons generated by the
free electrons inside this solenoid that propagate with a velocity
  !
v
s
= v
s
e
 
,
with a constant speed v
s
. We consider that the natural interference of the free
electrons inside the solenoid (their mutual repulsion) can be neglected w.r.t.
the external source- led that generates the electric current inside this solenoid.
Thus, the density of the free electrons in this solenoid is constant, so that for
any small angle    =
 
n
, where n >> 1, the number of free electrons in this
solenoid's section is N > 1. We denote the electrostatic potential generated
by a free electron (w.r.t. its rest-frame) in the solenoid's section at the angle
  +ff by 
+ff
, while that in the section at the angle  ff (symmetrically to the
observed angle  ) by  
 ff
.
From the fact that all free electrons in the solenoid's current move with a
constant speed
  !
v
s
= v
s
e
 
, there is no any electrostatic potential (  = 0)
generated by them (in our frame with cylindrical coordinate system), but only
the vector potential
  !
A generated by superposition of all moving electrostatic
potentials of each individual free electron of the current. We consider that
r r
0
>>d, where d is diameter of the wire of the solenoid, so that all N free
electrons in a given section large the in nitesimal angle   =
 
n
, forn>> 1, are
practically at the same distance from the observed point (r; ), and that inside
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru 176Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2022
this sector    all N free electrons practically propagate linearly with constant
speedv
s
. Hence, from (72)

, for the discrete set of angles ff =j  , 0 j  2n,
so that 0 ff  2  covers the whole solenoid, we obtain:

Note that each short-range photon has an angular speed as well caused by the
angular speed of the free electrons in the solenoid. So, the cloud of short-
distance photons emitted/absorbed by the free electrons in the solenoid has an
radial movement from and toward (returning phase) the center of solenoid, but
also this rotation around the solenoid which generates a vortex of short-range
photons. The radial movement of the photons of this dense cloud has no effect
to the electrons in the beams, because they have impact on them from both
sides (emitted/returned photons) with the same radial momentum quantity.
But the angular momentum of the vortex of the short-range photons in this
vortex is only in one direction: so its effects on the left-hand and right-hand

sides of the electron-beams around the solenoid are very different, and this ex-
plains the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
So, we have the collisions of the two uids: the vortex uid of the massive short-
range photons emitted from the solenoid (intermediators for the electromagnetic
vector-potential
  !
A) and the uid of the coherent beam of the electrons outside
the solenoid. In the two-uid hydrodynamics the superuid (Magnus force is
not the only force on the vortex transverse to its velocity) there is also a trans-
verse force between the vortex and quasiparticles moving with respect to the
vortex. The transverse force from rotons was found by Lifshitz and Pitaevskij
[21] from the quasiclassical scattering theory and also Iordanskij [22] revealed
the transverse force from phonons. Then it was demonstrated that the Lifshitz-
Pitaevskij force for rotons and the Iordanskij force for phonons originate from
interference between quasiparticles which move past the vortex on the left and
on the right sides with different phase shifts, like in the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
So, let us consider in details such effects of the collisions between the vortex of
massive low-speed short-range photons around the solenoid and an individual
electron passing near to this solenoid vortex.
When the solenoid is 'on', the speed of the electron is

verse force F = m

acting on an individual electron (caused by the col-
lisions with the massive photons generated by the accelerated electrons in the
solenoid). This transverse is asymmetric (w.r.t. the left/right electron-beam
components around the solenoid) and experimentally demonstrated [18, 19, 20].
The word force is a label to describe a transfer of momentum between two ob-
jects: from the massive photons which creates a vortex around the solenoid and
an individual electron which passes close to this solenoid.
In hydrodynamics, such a ow pattern is called a vortex tube, a vortex line,
or simply a vortex. Thus, as noted in [23], the Aharonov-Bohm effect of the
transverse force is similar to the classical hydrodynamics Magnus force (The Ior-
danskij force [22] is related to the acoustic Aharonov-Bohm effect). The analogy
between wave scattering by vortex and electron scattering by the magnetic-ux
tube (the Aharonov-Bohm effect) was studied in classical hydrodynamics for
water surface waves (the acoustic Aharonov-Bohm effect).
The scattering of the electrons from the vortex of massive photons (quantum
intermediators of the electromagnetic potential vector
  !
A), emitted from the
solenoid (by generating a kind of a superuid), is analog to the scattering of
phonons by the vortex in the hydrodynamics [23]. In fact, the formula (56) in

[23], representing the quasiclassical solution  of the sound equation, is formally
similar to the rest-mass energy wave packet 	 of an electron in the IQM, where
~! corresponds to the electrons total energy and ~
  !
k to its momentum; The
variation of the action  S, due to interaction with the circular velocity from
the vortex along quasiclassical trajectories, corresponds to the variation of the
phase ~  
R
used here in our IQM theory of Aharonov-Bohm effects:
"Using this solution in the momentum balance one obtains the equation of
vortex motion, which contains the Iordanskii force. The momentum transfer re-
sponsible for the Iordanskii force occurs at small scattering angles where a phe-
nomenon analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm effect is important: an interference
between the waves [here: the electron's rest-mass energy density wave-packets]
on the left and on the right from the vortex with different phase shifts after
interaction with the vortex."
From page 3 in [23].
However, the relationship with Aharonov-Bohm effects presented in [23] (Sec-
tion 7) is given in the statistical Schr odinger equation SQM framework, while
here this work is done in the IQM classical deterministic mechanics framework.
