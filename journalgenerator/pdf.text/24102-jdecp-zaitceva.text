Absract. The paper presents a generalized algorithm for designing closed op-
timal systems with a dynamic controller and a nonlinear actuator. The purpose
of the proposed algorithm is to identify the area of system performance degra-
dation, manifested as unintentional oscillations, due to the inuence of actuator
nonlinearity and reduce this area. The algorithm is implemented using a heuris-
tic search algorithm and the method of sequential nonlinear correction. The
results of the algorithm operation are shown on the PI control system of the
angular plant motion with a saturated actuator. Simulation of the system with
various input parameters showed the possibility of uctuations in the system
output. The numerical analysis results of the nonlinear system are presented in
the form of exponential diagrams of the performance error, covering all input
parameters.

1 Introduction
Actuators are usually designed without large reserves of traction forces due to
restrictions on the mass and size of the engineering object. During operation,
the actuator is close to the limit of its traction, which can lead the system to the
verge of stability. The system stability can be affected by external disturbances,
large amplitudes of the input signal, and sharp manoeuvring. Therefore, the
controller synthesis based on ensuring global asymptotic stability provides the
desired result only in a limited range of system parameters [1].
Studies show that nonlinearities such as saturation in terms of speed and
level of the control signal have a valuable negative impact on the operation of
systems [2{4]. In the literature, the so-called integrator excitation phenomenon
in a feedback system, or windup, is known, when the control signal is lim-
ited, the integrator accumulates an error, leading to undesirable output oscil-
lations [1{3]. The increasing amplitude of the output oscillations can lead to
the destruction of the equipment. Hence, an additional saturation compen-
sation block is introduced for the nominal regulator. The static anti-windup
compensator is implemented as part of the standard controller in the form of
an ampli ed mismatch between the input and output of the saturation. That
is, its structure involves measuring the saturation level. However, such an ap-
proach is unrealizable if a human operator acts as a regulator. Another way
to compensate for saturation is to introduce a phase-advancing nonlinear  lter
into the rive control loop, which increases the phase stability margin [5{7]. The
phase compensation method has found application in aircraft control systems
to avoid oscillations about the axes of inertia. Also, a promising approach can
be nonlinearity compensation using neural networks, as shown in [8], where the
dependence of the material size on temperature has the form of hysteresis and
negatively affects the positioning accuracy of the drive. It is necessary to focus
on the safety of nonlinear electric drive systems, intensive research on stabil-
ity and the development of safe controls due to the spread of various robotic
technology in human life. An illustrative example of this fact is the existence
of hidden attractors in the system, the identi cation of which is possible only
with the help of specially developed computational procedures [9,10].
The authors have investigated the ability of oscillation prevention in the
manual control system of an aircraft and a robotic arm [6, 11]. These works
show the effective use of a serial nonlinear corrective device to stabilize the
controlled parameter. It seems that for all systems, there is a range of oper-

ating parameters and a saturation level that limits this range. It has led to
an assumption that it is possible to select numerically the area of acceptable
operating parameters for a particular system. This paper aims to develop a
technique that allows any control system to mistakenly identify the  eld of
input signal parameters in which stability loss is possible.
2 Optimal Control System with Saturated Actuator
2.1 Brief description of the synthesis algorithm
Some works show that it is possible to design a controller in a system with a
constraint by optimal control methods. However, such solutions lead to relay
control, signi cant computational di culties, and, ultimately, failures in imple-
mentation in digital systems [1, 12]. The approach proposed in this paper is
also based on the principle of system optimality. The algorithm contains ad-
ditional steps associated with a nonlinear correction method described below.
Let us assume that the block diagram of the system control corresponds to
that shown in Fig. 1, where a nonlinear correction device (or nonlinear  lter)
is already embedded into the actuator speed control loop.

The nonlinear  lter proposed for use is described by the following equations
[6,7,13]:

where   =T

The harmonic linearization coe cients of the nonlinear  lter are determined
by the well-known formulas [14,15], and (1), (2), and (3) have the expressions:

Fig. 2 shows the main used property of the nonlinear correction, which
consists of the ability to control the phase response regardless of the magnitude
of the input signal amplitude, which is important for nonlinear systems excited
by signals with various amplitudes and frequencies.

In the second point of Algorithm 1, it is required to solve the optimization
problem, which can be formulated as:
maxJ(K) =!
c
; subject to g(K)<b; (7)
where!
c
is the crossover frequency,K is the vector of controller gains, andg is
the function limited by the parameterb. It is convenient to impose restrictions
on the frequency indicators of the system quality, for example, the oscillation
index. Since the cutoff frequency is approximately inversely proportional to the
transient time, then (7) can be written as minJ(K) =t
t
.
Solution (7) reduces to a standard linear programming problem, which in
the general case can be solved by a gradientless search method. Many different
e ciency search algorithms can be used in the best way for problems in consid-
eration [16]. In this paper, the standard Nelder-Mead algorithm in MATLAB is
used for simplicity. The result of solving the problem (7) is a set of coe cients
of the controller.
In the last step of Algorithm 1, it is proposed to determine the area of
acceptable input signals r
 
for the system under consideration and the found
controller parameters. In this paper, it is proposed to construct the generalized
sensitivity function as a function of input signal parameters. To calculate it,
the assumption is introduced that the considered nonlinear system is uniformly
convergent for the class of signalsr
 
(t) =A sin(!t) and for eachr
 
(t) there is a
unique steady-state periodic solution y(t) such that e(t) =r
 
(t) y(t) [17,18].
By de nition, the generalized sensitivity function for a nonlinear system is
calculated as follows [18,19]:
S(A;!) =
jje(t)jj
2
jjr
 
(t)jj
2
; (8)
where A and ! are the amplitude and frequency of the reference signal.
Equation (8) is the function of two arguments, which makes it possible to
construct a three-dimensional diagram for greater clarity.
3 Illustrative Example
3.1 System Description
Let's execute the modelling of the feedback control system shown in Fig. 1 with
a nominal controller, a nonlinear actuator, and a plant described below. The
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2024.102 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 16Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 1, 2024
control law is described by a standard proportional-integral (PI) form aimed
at eliminating the performance error e(t) =r
 
(t) r(t). The transfer function
of PI controller from performance error e(t) to control signal u
c
(t) is written
as [20]:
W

(s) =K

K

where K
p
and K

are the unknown gains to be found.
Let us assume that the control is performed by one variable - a coordinate
or an angle. So, the transfer function of the plant together with the actuator
from the control signal u
c
(t) to the system output r(t) can be written as:
W
p

where T
a
is the actuator time constant, and the rest of the parameters refer to
the plant: k
 
is the gain,T
 
is the time constant,  is the damping gain, and!
 
is the natural frequency.
The appearance of saturation is possible both in terms of the level and
the speed of the signal. Consider speed saturation as the most problematic,
which can be described by the function: sat

• input is harmonic with amplitudes A = [5:::50] deg, and the frequencies

To improve the stability and performance quality of the system, we use
a nonlinear  lter (1)-(4) and determine its time constants for a given control
object and saturation level: T = 0:01 s and T

= 50 s.
Fig. 3 shows the time response of the nonlinear system under different
input parameters. It can be seen that the amplitude and frequency of the input

affect the performance error ( gures on the left), and there are a several inputs
at which the performance error tends to zero ( gure on the top right). The
introduction of a nonlinear  lter stabilizes the output (bottom right  gure).

4 Conclusion
The paper shows the dependence of nonlinear system performance on the in-
put signals parameters and the effect of actuator saturation. An algorithm is
proposed for synthesizing a control system with the nonlinear actuator. This
algorithm consists of automatic tuning of the controller parameters, embedding
a nonlinear corrective  lter, as well as constructing the area of acceptable pa-
rameters of the system inputs that provide the required quality of control. The
proposed algorithm can be applied in engineering control systems operating
based on performance errors at the simulation stage and in real-time control.
The results can be used in the design of systems and numerical analysis to
identify the area of prohibited parameters for security purposes.
