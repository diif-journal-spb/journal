Abstract
In this paper we prove the existence of solutions to fractional abstract integro-differential equa-
tion with impulsive nonlocal conditions in Banach spaces. The results are obtained using fractional
calculus and  xed point theorem. An example is provided to illustrate the theory.
1 Introduction
Fractional differential equations have recently been addressed by several researchers for a va-
riety of problems. The interest in the study of differential equations of fractional order lies in
the fact that fractional derivatives provide an excellent tool for the description of memory and
hereditary properties of various materials and processes. With this advantage, the fractional-
order models become more realistic and practical than the classical integer-order models, in
which such effects are not taken into account. As a matter of fact, fractional differential equa-
tions arise in many engineering and scienti c disciplines such as physics, chemistry, biology,Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2012
economics, control theory, signal and image processing, biophysics, blood ow phenomena,
aerodynamics,  tting of experimental data, etc. [17, 24, 25, 26] . For some recent development
on the topic, see [5, 20, 19] and the references therein.
In [14, 16] the authors have proved the existence of solutions of abstract differential equations
by using semigroup theory and  xed point theorem. Many partial fractional differential equa-
tions can be expressed as fractional differential equations in some Banach spaces [15].
The study of nonlocal Cauchy problem for abstract evolution differential equations has been ini-
tiated by Byszewski [11]. Subsequently several authors [12, 21] have discussed the problem for
different types of nonlinear differential and integrodifferential equations including functional
differential equations in Banach spaces. Balachandran et al. [6, 3, 4] established the exis-
tence of solutions of quasilinear integrodifferential equations with nonlocal conditions where
the quasilinear operator is unbounded. The existence of solutions of fractional abstract dif-
ferential equations with nonlocal initial condition was recently investigated by
 
NGu  er  ekata
[22] and Balachandran and Park [3]. Numerical experiments for fractional models on popula-
tion dynamics are discussed in [22]. On the other hand, the theory of impulsive differential
equations has undergone rapid development over the years and played a very important role
in modern applied mathematical models of real processes arising in phenomena studied in
physics, population dynamics, chemical technology, biotechnology and economics: see for in-
stance the monograph by Lakshmikantham et al. [18]. Benchohra and Seba [8] studied the
existence of fractional impulsive differential equations in Banach spaces while Balachandran
and Kiruthika [2] discussed the existence of nonlocal Cauchy problem for semilinear fractional
evolution equations where as Chang and Nieto [13] studied the same type of problem for
neutral integrodifferential inclusions via fractional operators. Belmekki et al. [7] proved the
existence of periodic solutions of nonlinear fractional differential equations where as Ahmad
and Nieto [1] discussed the existence results for nonlinear boundary value problem of frac-
tional integrodifferential equations with integral boundary conditions. Recently, the study of
impulsive differential equations has attracted a great deal of attention in fractional dynamics
and its theory has been treated in several works [10, 18]. Balachandran and Trujillo [10]
investigated the nonlocal Cauchy problem for nonlinear fractional integrodifferential equations
in Banach spaces which motivates to study the existence of solutions of fractional quasilinear
impulsive integrodifferential equations in Banach spaces by using the fractional calculus and
 xed point theorems. This work initiates new avenues for obtaining numerical solutions of
impulsive fractional integrodifferential equations.
2 Preliminaries
In this section, we shall introduce some basic de nitions, notations and lemmas which are used
throughout this paper.

for t> 0 , and '
ff
(t) = 0 for t  0, and '

Let B(X) be the Banach space of all linear and bounded operators on X. Now let us consider
the set of functions
PC(I;X) =fu :I = [0;T ]!X :u2C((t

there exist u(t

k
)g:
endowed with the norm

PC

t2I
ku(t)k
(PC(I;X);k:k
PC
) is a Banach space.
3 Semilinear Evolution problem
Consider the linear fractional impulsive evolution equation
u

k
0<ff  1
 uj
t=t

u(0) = u

where A(t) is a bounded linear operator on a Banach space X, I

u(t
k
+h) and u(t
 
k

u(t
k
+h) represent the right and left limits of u(t) at t =t
k
.
De nition 3.1 A function u(t) is said to be a solution of the abstract Cauchy problem (3.1)
if the following conditions are satis ed
(i) u2PC(I;X) and u2D(A(t)) for all t2I;

(ii) u

exists on I where 0<ff< 1;
(iii) u satis es Eq (3.1) on I and satisfy the conditions
 uj
t=t
k

k
(u(t
 
k

2X
Now, we assume the following conditions to prove the existence of a solution of the Eq.
(3.1).
(H1) A(t) is a bounded linear operator on X for each t2 I and the function t! A(t) is
continuous in the uniform operator topology and there exists a constant M such that
M = max

Theorem 3.3 If the hypotheses (H1) and (H2) are satis ed, then Equation (3.1) has a unique
solution onI. Moreover, the mappingu
0
!u is a lipschitz continuous fromX intoC([0;T ];X).

Proof
The proof is based on the application of Picards iteration method. Let M =

Let u;v2PC(I;X). Then from Eq. (3.3), we have for each t2I

< 1 for large n, then by the well-known generalization of
the Banach contraction principle, F has a unique  xed point u2 PC([0;T ] : X). This  xed
point is the solution of Eq. (3.1).
The uniqueness ofu and Lipschitz continuity of the mapu
0
!u are consequence of the following
argument. Let v be a mild solution of Eq.(3.1) on [0,T] with the initial value u

The result follows by the application of contraction mapping principle. Our next result is based
on the following well-known  xed point theorem.

P;Q be two operators such that

(ii) P is a contraction mapping;
(iii) Q is compact and continuous.
Then there exists z2S such that z =Pz +Qz:
Now, we assume the following condition with (H4) and apply the above  xed point theorem.
