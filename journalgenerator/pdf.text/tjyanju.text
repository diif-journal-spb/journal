Abstract
In this paper, we employ a complete Lyapunov function, Demidovic theorem
and the generalized theorems of Ezeilo to establish su cient conditions for the
existence of a limiting regime in the sense of Demidovic for certain second
order nonlinear vector differential equation. We equally prove that the limiting
regime is periodic or almost periodic with respect to variable t, uniformly in
X;Y whenever the forcing term is periodic or almost periodic. The results of
this paper are quiet new with respect to second order differential equations.
Keywords and phrases: second order nonlinear differential equation,
limiting regime, uniformly periodic (or almost periodic) solution, Lyapunov
function, convergence.

1. Introduction
We shall consider the following second order nonlinear vector differential equa-
tion:

is an n n symmetric, positive de nite matrix and the dots as usual indicate
differentiation with respect tot: It is also assumed that the functionsH andP
are continuous in their respective arguments displayed explicitly.
On the qualitative properties of second order differential equations, many in-
teresting results have been obtained. For results on stability [see: 1,2,3,10,11,
18,21,23,30,31], boundedness [see, 3,10,18,19,20,25,26,27,29] and convergence[
17,22,28]. But on the subject of a limiting regime in the sense of Demidovic,
as far as we know, nothing seems to have been done regarding second order
differential equations. The followings are some of the results on existence of a
limiting regime for third, fourth and  fth order differential equations.
In [15], Ezeilo used the ideas of Demidovic[12] and Ezeilo[16] to establish su -
cient conditions on the existence of a limiting regime to the third order nonlinear
differential equation of the form
x

00
+bx
0
+h(x) =p(t;x;x

)
where a; b are constants and h;p are continuous functions of their arguments.
Later, Afuwape and Omeike [8] considered a more general form of the equation
above which is of the form
x
000
+ax
00
+g(x
0
) +h(x) =p(t;x;x

)
the authors improved on the earlier results on the subject of discussion. Fur-
thermore, Olutimo[24] extended the results of Afuwape and Omeike [8] to the
corresponding vector version by considering a differential equation of the form
...

X +G(

Afuwape[9] also extended the results of Ezeilo[15] to the fourth order nonlinear
differential equation

where a;b;c are constants. Much later, Adesina[5] went further to consider a
more general fourth order nonlinear differential equation of the form

where a;b;c;d are constants.
Our goal in this paper is to establish su cient conditions for the existence
of a limiting regime in the sense of Demidovic and also prove that the limit-
ing regime is periodic or almost periodic for a second order non-linear vector
differential equations de ned in (1.1) whenever the forcing function P (t;X;
_
X)
is periodic or almost periodic in t uniformly with respect to X and
_
X. In es-
tablishing our results, we shall employ the direct method of Lyapunov coupled
with the approach of Demidovic[12] and theorems of Ezeilo[16].
2. Preliminary results and de nition
Demidovic[12] in 1961 considered a nonlinear system given by
_
X =F (X) +G(t) (2:1)
where F (X) and G(t) are continuous functions of their respective arguments
displayed explicitly. He gave su cient conditions which ensure the convergence
of all solutions of equation (2.1) to a periodic solution ( i.e limiting regime)
for t! 1. About four years later, Ezeilo[16] considered a more generalized
differential system of the form
_
X =f(t;X) +g(t;X) (2:2)
and came up with the following results.
Let f(t;X) in the equation (2.2) above satis es either
kf(t; 0)k m<1 for all t2R
or
Z

kf(t; 0)k
p
dt<1; 1 p< 2;
whileg(t;X) satis es Lipschitz condition, withg(t; 0)  0: Then, Ezeilo in [16]
stated and proved the following theorems for equation (2.2) above.
Theorem 2.1 [16]
Suppose that:
(i) there exists a positive de nite n n matrix A such that the eigenvalues of
fD +D
T
g, where D =A
@f
@X
, are all negative for all values of t and X.
(ii) f(t; 0) satis es either
kf(t; 0)k m<1 for all t2R
or
Z

for all X; Y; t, with (t) satisfying

Then, there exists a unique solution X
 
(t) of equation (2.2) such that
kX
 
(t)k m; for t2R; (2:3)
and every solution X(t) of equation (2.2) converges to X
 
(t) as t! +1:
Theorem 2.2 [16]
Suppose conditions (i) and (ii) of Theorem 2.1 hold, and if in addition the
following conditions hold
(i) iff(t;X) andg(t;X) are uniformly almost periodic int forkXk m, then
the unique solution X
 
(t) of equation (2.2) is uniformly almost periodic
(u.a.p) in t;
(ii) if f(t;X) and g(t;X) are both periodic functions of t, forkXk  m and
have the same period !, then X
 
(t) is periodic in t, with a least period !.
De nition 2.3 [8,12,15]
We say that a solution X
 
(t) of equation (2.1) is a limiting regime in the sense
of Demidovic, if there exists a constant m, 0 < m <1 such thatkX
 
(t)k 
m; 1<t<1 and if every other solution of equation(2.1)converges toX
 
(t)
as t!1:
De nition 2.4 [24]
A continuous function f : R! x is called almost periodic if for each   > 0
there exists %( ) > 0 such that every interval of length %( ) contains a number
  with property that
jf(t + ) f(t)j<  for each t2R:

tively.
Lemma 2.7 LetQ andD be any two realn n commuting symmetric matrices.
Then,
(i) the eigenvalues

where

Proof. See [6,7,13, 14].
Hence forth, it shall be assumed that vector functionP (t;X;
_
X) is separable in
the form
P (t;X;
_
X) =r(t) +Q(t;X;
_
X)
with r(t) = r(t) +Q(t; 0; 0) so that Q(t; 0; 0)  0: We shall write (1.1) in the
equivalent form as

Theorem 3.2
Suppose thatH(0) = 0 and conditions (i) and (ii) of Theorem 3.1 hold. Further,
suppose that there exists a solution X(t) of equation (1.1) such that

then X

where both A and B are n n constant symmetric matrices which commute
with each other. It is obvious that V(0,0) = 0.

To prove Theorem 3.1 completely, we need to prove that any two solutions
of (2.7) converge. This will be shown in the lemma below.

Given thatX

there exists positive constants say K

So that, for the unique solution X

X(t)k = 0;
which implies that
X(t) =X

This completes the proof of Lemma 3.5.
Proof of Theorem 3.1
Having proved Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5, the proof of Theorem 3.1 then fol-
lows exactly as in Theorem 1 of [7] with the obvious modi cations as required.
Proof of Theorem 3.2
The method to be used in proving Theorem 3.2 is as outlined in Ezeilo [7] but
with some modi cations as a result of Q(t;X;Y +R) which is almost periodic
in t.
Let us consider the function de ned as
 (t) =V (X(t + ) X(t);Y (t + ) Y (t))
where V is the function de ned in equation (3.2) with X; Y replaced by
X(t + ) X(t);Y (t + ) Y (t)); respectively. Then, we easily have by the
inequality (3.3) that there exists positive constants c
1
; c
2
both positive such
that
c

S(t)  (t) c
2
S(t) (3:20)
with
S(t) =fkX(t + ) X(t)k
2
+kY (t + ) Y (t)k

g:
Following the approach used in proving Lemma 3.5, we have for some positive
constants c
3
; c
4
that
_
    c

fkX(t + ) X(t)k
2
+kY (t + ) Y (t)k

with   =Q(t + ;X(t + );Y (t + ) +R(t + )) Q(t;X(t);Y (t) +R(t)):
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru 74Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2018
Now, we can rewrite (3.21) as
_
    c
3
fkX(t + ) X(t)k
2
+kY (t + ) Y (t)k
2
g

+ c
4
fkX(t + ) X(t)k +kY (t + ) Y (t)kgk k: (3:22)
Assuming now that the function Q is uniformly almost periodic in t. Then for
arbitrary number  > 0, we can  nd  > 0 such that
kQ(t+ ;X(t+ );Y (t+ )+R(t+ )) Q(t;X(t));Y (t)+R(t))k

noting that (t

, inequality (3.30) thus becomes

Multiplying inequality (3.31) by

it then follows that
kX(t + ) X(t)k +kY (t + ) Y (t)k   (3:32)
The proof of the  rst part of Theorem 3.2 is completes once we choose   to
satisfy (3.23) and   =c

The proof of the second part of Theorem 3.2 is as follows. Assuming that
Q(t;X;Y +R) is periodic int with period  and we  x the  in the de nition of
 (t). Then, the terms on the left hand side of (3.23) is identically zero, and if
we proceed just as we did above, we shall obtain the following in place of (3.30)
kX(t + ) X(t)k
2
+kY (t + ) Y (t)k
2
  0:
But the above cannot be less than zero. Therefore,
kX(t + ) X(t)k
2
+kY (t + ) Y (t)k
2
= 0:
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru 76Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2018
This obviously implies that
X(t + ) =X(t) and Y (t + ) =Y (t)
this therefore shows the periodicity as required and the proof of Theorem 3.2
is completed.
