Abstract
In this paper we prove the existence of a limiting regime in the sense of Demidovic for
certain third order nonlinear differential equations. We also prove that such a solution is
periodic ( or almost periodic) whenever the forcing term is periodic ( or almost periodic).
The generalized Theorems of Demidovic are used in the proofs of our results. The results
generalize earlier results in the literature.
Keywords:Existence of a limiting regime in the sense of Demidovic; Uniformly periodic
solution; Uniformly almost periodic solution; Third-order non-linear differential equations.

1 Introduction
In generalizing the results of Demidovic [5] on the existence of a limiting regime,
Ezeilo [7] considered the system of equations of the form
_
X = f(t;X) +g(t;X) (1.1)
where f(t;X) satis es either
jjf(t; 0)jj m<1 for all t2 IR
or
Z
1
 1
jjf(t; 0)jj
p
dt<1; 1 p< 2;
while g(t;X) satis es Lipschitz condition, with g(t; 0)  0:
Precisely, the following theorem was proved:
Theorem 1 [7], Suppose that
i) there exists a positive de nite n n matrix A such that the eigenvalues of
fD +D
T
g; where D =A
@f
@X
; are all negative,
ii) f(t; 0) satis es either
jjf(t; 0)jj m<1 for all t;
or
Z

jjf(t; 0)jj
p

iii) g(t; 0)  0 and
jjg(t;X) g(t;Y )jj (t)jjX Yjj
for all X;Y;t with (t) satisfying
Z

q
(t)dt<1; 1 q  2:
Then, there exists a unique solution X
 
(t) of (1.1) such that
jjX
 
(t)jj m; for t2 IR; (1.2)
and every other solution X(t) of (1.1) converges to X
 
(t) as t! +1:

Also, the following was proved [7]
Theorem 2 Suppose conditions (i) and (iii) of Theorem 1 hold, and if in ad-
dition the following conditions hold
I) iff(t;X) andg(t;X) are uniformly almost periodic int forjjXjj m; then
the unique solution X
 
(t) of (1.1) is uniformly almost periodic (u.a.p) in
t;
II) if f(t;X) and g(t;X) are both periodic functions of t; forjjXjj  m and
have the same period !, then X
 
(t) is periodic in t; with a least period !:
De nition 1 We shall say that a solution X
 
(t) of (1.1) is a limiting regime
in the sense of Demidovic, if there exists a constant m; 0<m<1 such that
jjX
 
(t)jj m;  1<t<1:
It is known that Ezeilo in [6, 7, 8, 10] applied the ideas of these theorems
to second order and third order nonlinear equations. Also, Afuwape [2] applied
these theorems to a fourth order non-linear differential equation. We also note
that Afuwape [1], Afuwape and Omeike [3, 4] and Tejumola [13, 14] studied
the convergence of some third order nonlinear differential equations. Other
considerations pre 1974 are also recorded in [12]. The existence of limiting
regime in the sense of Demidovic has only been addressed by few.
Our objective in this paper is to prove the existence of a limiting regime in
the sense of Demidovic by applying theorems 1 and 2 to third order non-linear
differential equations of the form
:::
x +a x +g( _ x) +h(x) =p(t;x; _ x;  x): (1.3)
Our method shall be in the use of a complete Lyapunov function. This equation
is more general than that considered by Ezeilo in [10] and unlike in [14] , we
use a complete Lyapunov function in our proofs. We also give an example to
illustrate the results.
We shall assume thatp(t;x; _ x;  x) is separable in the formq(t) +r(t;x; _ x;  x):
We shall write (1.3) in the equivalent system form
_ x = y
_ y = z +Q (1.4)
_ z =  az g(y) h(x) +r(t;x;y;z +Q) aQ

withQ(t) =

t
0
q(s)ds; andg(y); h(x) continuous in their respective arguments.
We shall also assume that the incrementary ratio H
 
( ) =
h( + ) h( )
 
; ( 6= 0);
of h(x) lies in a closed sub-interval [ 
0
;kab] of the Routh-Hurwitz interval
(0;ab); for some constant b > 0; such that g(y)=y > b; for all y 6= 0; and
g(0)  0; where k< 1; (this will be determined later).
2 The Main Results
Throughout this paper, we shall denote by D
j
; (j = 0; 1; 2; 3;    ) a positive
constant.
We shall assume that the solutions of (1.3) are uniquely determined by their
initial conditions. Since, we can always replace q(t) by q(t) +r(t; 0; 0; 0); we
shall assume that r(t; 0; 0; 0)  0: Moreover, we shall assume that the function
r(t;x;y;z +Q) satis es

The main result of this paper on the existence of a limiting regime in the
sense of Demidovic is the following:

Then, there exists a unique solution x

for t2 IR: Moreover, every other solution x(t) of equation (1.3) converges to
x
 
(t) as t!1:
Our other result on the almost periodicity or periodicity of the limiting
regime x
 
(t) is as follows:-
Theorem 4 Suppose thath(0) = 0 and that hypotheses (i) and (iii) of Theorem
3 hold. Suppose further that there exists a solution x(t) of equation (1.3) such
that
[x(t)]

Then

 D

; then x
 
(t) is almost periodic in t:
(II) ifQ(t) andr(t;x; _ x;  x) are periodic int; with period ; for [x(t)]
2
+[ _ x(t)]

+
[ x(t)]

 D

; then x
 
(t) is periodic in t; with period  :
Remark 1 If in equation (1.3) g( _ x) =b _ x; then the earlier results of Ezeilo in
[10] will be obtained from Theorems 3 and 4.
3 Some Preliminary results
Let (x;y;z) be any solution of system (1.4). Our main tool, in the use of
Theorems 1 and 2, for the proofs of the results is the following function, de ned

In line with Ezeilo [7], it su ces to prove the following lemma:
Lemma 3.5 Assume that the conditions (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of Theorem 1
hold. Then, for arbitrary t

Moreover there are  nite constants 
0
andk

, also dependent only ona;g;h and
q;r, such that if
V (x(t

Proof of Theorem 2.1
Having dealt with the proofs of lemmas 3.1-3.6, the proof of Theorem 2.1
then follows exactly as in the proof of [7, Theorem 1], with the obvious changes
as required.
Proof of Theorem 2.2
The method is as in [7] but with certain modi cations due to the presence
of the perturbation r(t;x;y;z +Q) which is uniformly almost periodic (u.a.p)
in t:
Consider the function
	(t) =V (x(t + ) x(t);y(t + ) y(t);z(t + ) z(t)) (3:25)
where V is the function de ned in (3.1) with x;y;z replaced by x(t + ) 
x(t);y(t + ) y(t) and z(t + ) z(t); respectively. Then, we easily have by
(3.2) that there exists positive constants d

> 0;d

> 0 such that
d

letting t

one obtains that

it follows that

where   is chosen to satisfy (3.29) with ` = d

d

11
. The set of all   satisfying
(3.29) is relatively dense, and hence (3.38) implies that (x(t);y(t);z(t)) is u.a.p.
This proves the  rst part of Theorem 2.2.
To prove the second part of the theorem, assume now that r(t;x;y;z +Q)
has the period ! in t and  x the   in the de nition of 	(t) equal to !. The
terms on the left hand side of (3.29) is identically zero, and so proceeding as
above we shall have, in place of (3.36) that
[x(t +w) x(t)]
2
+ [y(t +w) y(t)]
2
+ [z(t +w) z(t)]
2
  0:
Hence
[x(t +w) x(t)]
2
+ [y(t +w) y(t)]
2
+ [z(t +w) z(t)]
2
= 0
and it is readily seen that
x(t +w) =x(t); y(t +w) =y(t) and z(t +w) =z(t)
which is the required result. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.2.
