Then solutions of system (5) have asymptotics x(t) → 0 as t → +∞ for any
x(0).
This theorem extends result, obtained in [1] under condition κ

3 The proof of theorem
We introduce, following [2], the functions v(t) = v
n
for t
n
≤ t < t
n+1
, u(t) =
R
t
0
[f(t)−v(t)]dt, and y = x−bu and transform system (5) to the form
˙ y = Ay+bv+Abu. (8)
The objective of such a transformation is in ﬁnding the system such that the
function f is excluded, the function v is a ”frozen” function ϕ(σ(t)), and the
function u is small in a certain sense.
By (6) we have
c

b = c

Ab = 0. (9)
Consider now the Lyapunov function [3]

If the Hermitean matrix

is positively deﬁnite, then by the frequency theorem of V.A. Yakubovich for
the nondegenerate case [4] there exist μ > 0 and a positively deﬁnite matrix H
such that the term under integral sign in (17) may be estimated as follows
W
1
−G <−μ(u
2
+v
2
+|y|
2
). (19)
The Silvester criterion implies that for the positive deﬁniteness of this matrix
it is necessary and suﬃcient that for all ω∈ [0,+∞] the inequalities
α(ω) > 0, α(ω)β(ω)−|δ(ω)|
2
> 0
were satisﬁed. The second inequality coincides with frequency condition (7)
and therefore is also satisﬁed. The ﬁrst inequality follows directly from the
second one. Really, as ω →∞ β → τ
1
, δ → 0, and, consequently, α(∞) > 0
and α(ω) cannot be zero for any ω.
Thus estimate (19) is proved.
Relations (17) and (19) resulted in the inequality

. (20)
By (4) and by the positive deﬁniteness of the matrix H V → +∞ as
|y| → ∞. Therefore (20) implies that u,v ∈ L
2
[0,+∞). Since the matrix
A is the Hurwitzian one, it follows from (8) that y(t)→ 0 as t→ +∞. From
that v∈ L
2
[0,+∞) and from (1) the asymptotics v(t)→ 0 as t→ +∞ follows.
In [2] it is stated that |u| ≤ T|v| and therefore u → 0 as t → +∞. Finally,
from the relation x = y−bu it follows that x→ 0 as t→ +∞. The proof of
theorem is completed
