Abstract 
 
In this paper we investigate stability and boundedness of solutions of some nonlinear differential 
equations of third order with delay. By constructing a Lyapunov functional, sufficient conditions for 
the stability and boundedness of solutions for equations considered are obtained.  
 
Keywords: Stability, boundedness, Lyapunov functional, differential equations of third order     
                    with delay.

1. Introduction 
 
The results existing in the literature on the stability and boundedness of solutions of nonlinear 
differential equations of third order with bounded delay have been developed over the last several 
decades. After a literature survey about nonlinear equations of third order with bounded delay, one can 
conclude that there are not so many results on the stability and boundedness of solutions. Up to this 
moment, the investigations concerning stability and boundedness of solutions of nonlinear equations of 
third order with bounded delay have not been fully developed. Certainly, these results should be 
obtained to be able to benefit from the applications of the theory of stability and boundedness of 
solutions. At the same time, we should recognize that some significant theoretical results concerning 
the stability and boundedness of solutions of third order nonlinear differential equations with delay 
have been achieved, see  for example the papers of  Sadek [9], Tejumola and Tchegnani [10], Tunç 
([11], [12]), Zhu [14] and the references citied in these papers. It should be noted that, in 1969, Differential Equations and Control Processes, № 3, 2007

respectively, abbreviated as x , y and z . Then the solution is unique (See [2, pp.14].)   
The motivation for the present work has been inspired basically by the paper of Palusinski et al. [8] 
and the papers mentioned above. Our aim here is to discuss the result verified by Palusinski et al. [8] 
on the stability of the solutions to the equation (1) for the stability and  boundedness of solutions of 
this equation in the case 0 = p and 0 ≠ p , respectively.    
 
 
2. Preliminaries 
 
In order to reach our main result, we give some important basic information for the general non-
autonomous delay differential system (see also Burton [1], Èl’sgol’ts [2], Èl’sgol’ts and Norkin [3], 
Hale [4], Kolmanovskii and Myshkis [5], Kolmanovskii and  Nosov [6], Krasovskii  [7] and 
 Yoshizawa [13]. 
Now, we consider the general non-autonomous delay differential system

following lemma is given.

First for the case 0 )) ( )), ( ( )), ( ( ), ( ), ( , ( = − − t z t r t y t r t x t y t x t p the following result is established. 
 
Theorem 2: In addition to the basic assumptions imposed on the functions
