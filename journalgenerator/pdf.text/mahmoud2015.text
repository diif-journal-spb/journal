Abstract
In this paper, by constructing Lyapunov functionals we investigate su cient condi-
tions, for the stochastic asymptotic stability of the zero solution of certain second-order
stochastic differential equations with delay.
By de ning an appropriate Lyapunov functionals, we prove two new theorems on the
stochastic asymptotic stability. Our results improve and form a complement to some
known recent results in the literature.
Keywords and phrases: Stochastic differential equations, delay, asymptotic
stability, Lyapunov functional.
1 Introduction
Modeling of physical systems by ordinary differential equations, ignores
stochastic effects. By adding random elements into the differential equations we
obtain what is called a stochastic differential equation and the term stochastic
is called noise [10].

Stochastic differential equation is a differential equation, in which one or
more of the terms is a stochastic process and resulting in a solution which is
itself a stochastic process.
Stochastic differential equations play a relevant role in many application
areas including environmental modeling, engineering, biological modeling and
mostly, one of more important application of stochastic differential equation is
in the modeling of electrical networks.
Due to statistical properties, a stochastic process can be used to de ne the
randomness in an uncorrelated white Gaussian noise, which can be thought of
as the derivative of Brownian motion (or the Wiener process) [20].
In many branches of science and industry stochastic delay differential equa-
tions have been used to model the evolution phenomena because the measure-
ments of time-involving variables and their dynamics usually contain some de-
lays.
Furthermore stochastic perturbations are often introduced into these deter-
ministic systems in order to describe the effects of uctuations in real environ-
ment, thus yield stochastic delay differential equations.
Mathematically stochastic delay differential equations were  rst introduced
by It^ o and Nisio [7], in which the existence and uniqueness of the solutions have
been investigated.
In the last several decades, numerous studies have been developed toward
the study of stochastic delay differential equations, such as stochastic stability,
Lyapunov functional method, Lyapunov exponent, stochastic ow and attrac-
tion etc. (see [5], [8], [9], [15], [16], [18], [24] and the references therein).
Stability is one of the most important problems in the study of stochastic
delay differential equations. One of the powerful techniques employed in the
study of the stability problem is the method of the Lyapunov functionals.
One general method of Lyapunov functionals constructed both for determin-
istic and stochastic delay differential equations was proposed and developed by
many authors, for examples, [12, 13, 19].
The advantage of this method can judge the stability of systems without
knowledge of the solutions. Therefore it is at all times hotpot in the study of
the stability theory in the last century.
On the other hand, since the introduced stochastic calculus about  fty
years ago, the theory of stochastic differential equations have been developed
very quickly. In particular, the Lyapunov's second method has been developed
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 2Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2015
to deal with stochastic stability by many authors, for example, [14, 17].
However it is generally much more di cult to construct the Lyapunov func-
tionals in the case of delay, than the Lyapunov functionals in the case of non-
delay of higher-order, for example, [1  3; 22; 23; 25  28]. Therefore anther
useful technique has been developed, that is to compare the stochastic delay
differential equations with the corresponding non-delay equations.
Besides it is worth-mentioning that, there are only few papers on the same
topic for certain  rst-order stochastic differential equations with delay, for ex-
ample, [14, 21].
In [14], Kolmanovskii and Shaikhet present an interesting survey of a gen-
eral method of Lyapunov functionals construction for stochastic differential
equations of neutral type.
In this paper by constructing Lyapunov functionals, we investigate su cient
conditions for the asymptotic stability of the zero solution to the following
second-order stochastic delay differential equations
 x(t) +a _ x(t) +bx(t h) + x(t) _ !(t) = 0 (1.1)
and
 x(t) +a _ x(t) +f(x(t h)) + x(t  ) _ !(t) = 0; (1.2)
where a;b and   are positive constants, h and   are two positive constant
delays; !(t)2 R is a standard Wiener process; f(x) is a continuous function
and f(0) = 0.
2 Preliminaries and stability result
A general scalar stochastic differential equation has the following form
dx(t) =f(t;x(t))dt +g(t;x(t))d!(t); (2.1)
where f(t;x(t)) : [0;T ] R! R and g(t;x(t)) : [0;T ] R! R are drift
and diffusion coe cients and !(t) is the so called Wiener process, a stochastic
process representing the noise [11].
Instead the appropriate stochastic chain rule, known as It^ o formula contains
an additional term. This additional term which roughly speaking is due to the
fact that the square of the stochastic differential (d!(t))
2
is equal to dt, in the
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 3Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2015
mean-square sense, i.e. E[(d!(t))
2
] = dt. So the second-order term in d!(t)
should really appear as a  rst-order term in dt.
Suppose x(t) is a solution of the stochastic differential equation (2:1) for
some suitable functions f;g. Let g(t;x(t)) : (0;1) R!R be a twice contin-
uously differentiable function.
Let the function
y(t) =g(t;x(t));
be a stochastic process, for which
dy(t) =
@g
@t
(t;x(t))dt +
@g
@x
(t;x(t))dx(t) +

2
@
2
g
@x
2
(t;x(t))(dx(t))
2
; (2.2)
where (dx(t))
2
=dx(t):dx(t) is computed according to the rules
dt:dt =dt:d!(t) =d!(t):dt = 0; d!(t):d!(t) =dt:
Hence for any given initial value x(0) =x
0
the stochastic differential equa-
tion has a unique global solution denoted byx(t;x
0
). Assume furthermore that
f(t; 0) = 0 and g(t; 0) = 0 for all t   0. Hence the stochastic differential
equation admits the zero solution x(t; 0)  0.
De nition 2.1 The zero solution of the stochastic differential equation is said
to be stochastically stable or stable in probability, if for every pair of  2 (0; 1)
and r> 0, there exists a   = ( ;r)> 0 such that
Pfjx(t;x

)j<r for all t  0g  1  ; wheneverjx

j<

:
Otherwise, it is said to be stochastically unstable.
De nition 2.2 The zero solution of the stochastic differential equation is said
to be stochastically asymptotically stable, if it is stochastically stable and more-
over for every  2 (0; 1) and r> 0, there exists a   = ( )> 0 such that

We naturally consider the It^ o differential of the process V (t;x(t)), where
x(t) is a solution of the stochastic differential equation and V is a Lyapunov
function. According to the It^ o formula, we of course require V 2 C
1;2

R

;R
+
), which denotes the family of all non-negative functions V (t;x) de ned
on S
h
 R
+
such that they are twice continuously differentiable in x and once
in t.
By the It^ o formula we have
dV (t;x(t)) =LV (t;x(t))dt +V
x
(t;x(t))g(t;x(t))d!(t);
where
LV (t;x(t)) =V

We shall see that
_
V (t;x(t)) will be replaced by the diffusion operatorLV (t;x(t))
in the study of stochastic stability. For example, the inequality
_
V (t;x(t))  0
will sometimes by replaced by LV (t;x(t))  0 to get the stochastic stability.
Theorem 2.1 Assume that there exist V2C

(S

that
V (t; 0) = 0;  (jxj)<V (t;x) and

Then the zero solution of the stochastic differential equation is stochastically

Then the zero solution of the stochastic differential equation is stochastically

Now we present the main stability results of (1:1) and (1:2).

From the results (4:3); (4:4) and (4:5), we note that all the conditions of Theo-
rem 2.2 are satis ed, so that the zero solution of (1:2) is stochastically asymp-
totically stable.
This completes the proof of Theorem 2.4.
5 Conclusions
If we allow for some randomness in some of the coe cients of a differential
equation, we often obtain a more realistic mathematical model of the situation.
So the study of stochastic differential equations is richer than the classical
deterministic ones.
By constructing Lyapunov functionals, su cient conditions for the stochas-
tic asymptotic stability of the zero solution of two equations (1:1) and (1:2).
The obtained results are extend existing results in the literature on determin-
istic systems to stochastic delay systems.
Finally, we can say that there exist a lot of applications for the second-order
stochastic differential equations with delay or without delay.
The importance of second-order equations is conditioned by Newton second
low.
