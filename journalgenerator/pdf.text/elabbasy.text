1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
    We are concerned with the oscillation of solutions of second order differential 
equations with damping terms of the following form

such that xg(x)>0 for x ≠0 and g ′(x)>0 for x ≠0. φ is defined and continuous on R×R-{0} 
with u φ(u,v)>0 for  uv ≠0 and φ( λu, λv)= λφ(u,v) for  0< λ< ∞ and (u,v) ∈R×R-{0}. 
 
    By oscillation of equation (1.1)[(1.2)], we mean a function x ∈C¹([T

and satisfies equation 
(1.1)[(1.2)] on [T
x
, ∞). 
    A solution of equation (1.1)[(1.2)] is called oscillatory if it has arbitrarily large zeros 
otherwise, it is called nonoscillatory. Finally, equation (1.1)[(1.2)] is called oscillatory if 
all its solutions are oscillatory. 
    In Section 2 we provide sufficient conditions for the oscillation of all solutions of 
(1.1). Several particular cases of (1.1) have been discussed in the literature. To cite a 
few examples, the differential equation

oscillation theorems for (1.3), (1.4). In particular, we extend and improve the results 
obtained in [13], [17], [2] and [14]. 
    In Section 3 we will establish oscillation criteria for equation (1.2). Several particular 
cases of (1.2) have been discussed in the literature. To cite a few examples, the

2.  OSCILLATION RESULTS FOR (1.1) 
 
    In order to discuss our main results, we need the following well-known inequality 
which is due to Hardy et al. [4]. 
Lemma 2.1. If X and Y are nonnegative, then 
 
1
 X +( -1)Y - XY 0,  >1,
λλ λ

−

where equality holds if and only if X=Y. 
Theorem 2.1. Suppose, in addition to conditions 
 (1,z) z  for all z 0,                                      (2.1)
0< (x)  for all x,                               (2.2)

that there exist differentiable functions 
 
0
k,  :[t , ) (0, )   with (t) 0 ρ ρ ∞→∞ ≥   
and the continuous function 
 
H : D ≡{(t,s): t ≥s ≥t
0
} →R   and  h : D
0
≡{(t,s): t>s ≥t
0
} →R, 
and H has a continuous and nonpositive partial derivative on D  with respect to the 
second variable such that 
 
H(t,t)=0  for   t ≥t
0
,   H(t,s)>0  for   t>s ≥t

and

- (H(t,s)k(s))=h(t,s)(H(t,s)k(s))  for all  (t,s) D .

Proof. On the contrary we assume that (1.1) has a nonoscillatory solution x(t). We 
suppose without loss of generality that x(t)>0  for all  t ∈ [t
0
, ∞). We define the function 
ω(t) as

Now, suppose that (2.14) holds. With the same argument as in Theorem 2.2, we 
conclude that (2.17) is satisfied. By (2.24), there exists a constant M such that (2.18) is 
fulfilled. Then, following the procedure of the proof of Theorem 2.2, we see that (2.22) 
holds, which contradicts (2.25). This contradiction proves that (2.25) fails. The 
remainder of the proof is similar to that of Theorem 2.2, so we omit the details. This 
completes the proof of Theorem 2.3. 
 
    Theorem 2.4. Suppose that (2.1) and (2.2) are satisfied and let the functions H, h, ρ 
and k be the same as in Theorem 2.1. Moreover, suppose that Differential Equations and Control Processes, № 4, 2008

then equation (1.1) is oscillatory. 
The proof of Theorem 2.4 can be carried out as the proof of Theorem 2.2 and therefore 
it will be omitted.   
 
    Remark 2.1. If α=2 and p(t) ≡0, r(t) ≡1 and ψ(x) ≡1, then Theorem 2.1, 2.2 extend and 
improve theorem in [17]. 
 
    Remark 2.2. If p(t) ≡0, r(t) ≡1 and ψ(x) ≡1, then Theorem 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 extend and 
improve Theorem 2, 4 and 3 of Li [13], respectively. 
 
    Remark 2.3. If p(t) ≡0, then Theorem 2.1-2.4 extend and improve Theorem 2, 4, 6 
and 5 in [2], respectively.
