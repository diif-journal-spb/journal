Abstract.
Group invariant solutions of the magma equation have been investigated
for different values of two physical parameters.
1 Introduction
The ﬂow of melt in the earth’s mantle which is like a porous ﬂow is effected by
the buoyant force caused by the density difference between melt and matrix.
The model equation describing this motion and the phase transition have been
investigated by many authors
1,2)
. Neglecting the phase transition and allowing
only vertical motions, Scott and Stevenson
3)
proposed an equation assuming
that the melt and matrix are fully connected and incompressible, which was
given by
u

= [u

x andt denote vertical space co-ordinate and time respectively, andu =u(x,t)
is the mean volume fraction of the liquid phase which is non-negative for any
x and t. The parameters n and m denote the dependency of permeability and
effective viscosity. Scott and Stevenson suggested that the reasonable values of
n and m are 2∼ 5 and 0∼ 1 respectively. Equation (1.1) is called the magma
equation.

obtained the explicit form of travelling wave so-
lutions of equation (1.2) by using the transformation from z to ζ given by

An n

Lie group of transformations, 2≤r ≤n, can be reduced to an (n−r)

ODE if the Lie group is solvable. The reduced (n−r)
th
order ODE can be
obtained directly from the givenn
th
order ODE without the need to determine
any intermediate ODEs of orders n − r + 1 to n − 1. Solvable Lie groups
play an important role in the study of group invariance of ordinary and partial
differentialequations
