Abstract 
 
           In [1] and [2], the authors used a linear incidence rate into a mathematical model 
to examine the immune impairment for a proliferation model of CTL responses in 
the immune response to HIV. Under the assumption that the immune impairment 
increases over the HIV infection, they classified four processes of the disease 
progression dynamics, according to their virological properties. In particular they 
showed that a typical disease progression presents a risky threshold and an 
immunodeficiency threshold. Moreover the immune system might collapse when 
the impairment rate of HIV exceeds a threshold value. On the other hand if the 
immune impairment rate never exceeds the threshold value, the viral replication is 
well controlled by CTL responses. In this paper we show that all of the above 
results remain valid if we use a general functional response,      instead of    as 
the incidence rate into the above mathematical model.

    The origin of various disease progression in HIV(i.e. Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus is a lentivirus(i.e. a member of retrovirus family, that causes acquired

immunodeficiency syndrome,AIDS.) infection is largely unresolved but many 
researchers have been trying to explain it. An important factor in understanding the 
unusual incubation period distribution in the development of AIDS(i.e. Acquired 
Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is the dynamics of the long-lasting struggle between HIV 
and our immune system [3]. In early models of HIV infection [4] an explosion in the 
virus load caused by increased HIV variants diversity explains the immune system 
collapse in [5]. The CTL(i.e. Cytotoxic T Cells or killer T cell or Cytotoxic T-
lymphocyte are a sub-group of T cells which induce the death of cells that are infected 
with viruses or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional.) exhaustion induced by an 
evolutionary increase of viral infectivity accounts for immune deficiency. Moreover, in 
[6] the functional deteriorations of T and B cells caused by accumulations of deleterious 
mutations are considered as a reason for development of AIDS. 
In [1,2]  the authors present discussion of an immune impairment effect caused by the 
depletion and dysfunction of DC(i.e. Dendritic cells are immune cells forming part of 
the mammalian immune system.) on HIV disease progression. Because the progressive 
decrease of DC number and function during the course of HIV-1 is observed [7,8,9]. 
The authors in [1,2] simply assumed that the immune impairment effect increases over 
HIV infection.  
The authors in [1,2] by using the discussion of the immune impairment effect caused by 
the depletion and dysfunction of DC on HIV disease program, extend the standard 
virus-immune model including the effect of immune impairment cause by HIV infection 
[4] to the following equations:

target cells, the exposed or infected cells that produce virus and the infective or HIV-1 
virus particles at time  , respectively. The positive constants                  and   are 
the proliferation rate of CD4

 T cells( i.e. helper T cells are immune response mediators 
and play an important role in establishing and maximizing the capabilities of the 
adaptive immune response. These cells have no cytotoxic or phagocytic activity and 
cannot kill infected cells or clear pathogens, but in essence manage the immune 
response, by directing other cells or perform these tasks.), the decay rate of infected

Finally,       is the incidence rate of the transmission of the infection or the rate of

Notice that most of the famous functional responses such as: Lotka-Voltra, Michealis-
Menten, Holling type II, Holling type IV, Monod-Haldane, Ivlev and Rosenzweig 
satisfy the above hypotheses. See the appendix.  
The authors in [1] studied the mathematical analysis of the system (1.1) by assuming 
that the rate of infection is bilinear i.e.          . However, the actual incidence 
rate is probably not linear over the entire range of  . Thus, it is reasonable to assum that 
the infected rate is given by one of the famous functional responses such as Michealis-
Menten, Holling type II and IV, Monod-Haldane, Ivlev and Rosenzweig. Since all of 
these functional responses satisfy hypotheses H

, we consider the system (1.1) with 
the general functional response     , for mathematical analysis investigation of HIV 
infection.   
In this paper, we will analyze the global stability of the viral free equilibrium and the 
local and global stability of the infected equilibrium points for general incidence rate. In 
fact, we will show that the results which are obtained in [2] remain valid for general 
functional response,     . In fact the model (1.1) has four possible equilibria: 
uninfected equilibrium, shortage state equilibrium, immunodeficiency equilibrium and 
controlled state equilibrium. In section 2, we consider the stability of the uninfected and 
the shortage state equilibria. In section 3, we study the stability of the other equilibria. 
In section 4, we will discuss the biological results.         
2  Equilibrium Points and Stability  
   In this section and the next one, we will find the equilibrium points of the system (1.1) 
and then we will consider the stability property of them. In order to do this, we will find 
the eigenvalues of the linearized system of this system at these points. 
At an equilibrium point of the system (1.1) we must have  
{
                     
                  
    
    
                       
                                                                                        
From the third equation we obtain      or 
   
    
  .  
In the following, we consider the case     and the other case will be considered in 
section 3. 
By substituting      into the second equation yields,            . If    , then 
from the first equation we must have   
 
 
. Thus  
 
  
 
 
      is one of the 
equilibrium points which is called uninfected steady state of the system. If         
 , by using this in the first equation of (2.1) we get   
    
 
. Hence at the second 
equilibrium point, if exists we must have  
                                                                                                                                 
By hypothesis,  
 
, we have  ̇  . Since at an equilibrium point we must have 
  
    
 
   the acceptable root of (2.2) must be in the interval,    
 
 
 . Therefore the Differential Equations and Control Processes, № 1, 2013

second equilibrium point exists if and only if,   
 
 
   . Let  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
. This number is 
called the basic reproductive ratio of the virus for the system. Thus we have the 
following theorem. 
Theorem 2.1 . For    , if  
 
  , then the uninfected steady state  
 
   
 
 
      is 
the unique equilibrium point of the system (1.1). If  
 
  , then in addition to the 
uninfected steady state , there is another equilibrium point  
 
    
 
  
 
    with 
 
 
    
 
 
  and  
 
  .    
Here we will analyze the local asymptotical stability of these equilibrium points. In 
order to do this, we check the sign of the eigenvalues of Jacobi matrix of (1.1) at these 
points. This matrix is given by   
     [
     
 
         
  
 
               
   
    
   
      
 
   
    
  
]                                                  
where           .  
At first we consider the local stability of the equilibrium point  
 
. Hence, we calculate 
the eigenvalues of    
 
 : 
   (  
   
    
 
 )    
   
[
 
 
 
      
 
 
  
       
 
 
  
     
]
 
 
 
 
    
Therefore, the eigenvalues of    
 
  are the roots of the characteristic polynomial  
     (     (
 
 
) )         
Thus,  
 
    , 
 
     (
 
 
) and  
 
    are the eigenvalues of    
 
 . Clearly, 
 
 
 and  
 
 have negative real part. If,  
 
     (
 
 
)  , then the rest point  
 
 is 
locally asymptotically stable. This condition is the same as,   
 
  . Therefore, we 
have proved the following theorem. 
Theorem 2.2. If  
 
  , the equilibrium point  
 
 is locally asymptotically stable and if 
 
 
  , this equilibrium point  is unstable.  
Now we will show that if  
 
  , the equilibrium point  
 
 is globally asymptotically 
stable. First of all, consider the following domain in the         space, 
 
 
 {                        }     
 
 
    
It follows from hypotheses  
 
 and  
 
 and the equations of the system (1.1), if an orbit 
initiating on the boundary of  
 
, then this orbit gets into  
 
 immediately as time 
increases. This means that the flow generated by that system gets into  
 
 on the 
boundary of  
 
. Let    
 
, for   
 
 
 and consider the following set for     : Differential Equations and Control Processes, № 1, 2013

                         }  
 
where,              
 
 (
 
 
  )  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 , and  
 
    
 
 
 .  
If we differentiate          along the orbits of the system (1.1), we obtain: 
 
  
  
      
 
  ̇  
 
 ̇ 
 
 
  
  
 ̇      
 
               
 
 
               
 
 
  
  
(
    
    
   )      
 
        
          
 
  
 
 
   
  
  [   
 
   
 
 
  
  
    
    
]  
 
Since on that part of the surface,            which is some part of the boundary of 
the set  
 
, we have        and     
 
   and     
 
   
 
 
  
  
    
    
 
   
 
   
 
 
  
  
  
 
    , therefore 
  
  
  . Thus, the flow gets into  
 
 on 
          . Hence the flow gets into  
 
 from its boundery. Therefore, if an orbit 
starts outside of  
 
 in  , then that orbit must get into  
 
 in a finite positive time. But, 
 
 
  
   
 
̅
 
. Hence, if  an orbit start in  , then it must approach to  
 
 as time tends to 
infinity. Hence we have proved the following theorem. 
 
Theorem 2.3. If  
 
  , then  
 
 is the only rest point of the system (1.1). This rest 
point is globally asymptotically stable.  
 
Now we consider the local asymptotical stability of  
 
. Notice that from (2.3) we have 
  
   
 
  [
    
 
 
 
  
 
    
 
 
 
 
  
 
     
 
  
  
 
 
 
    
 
  
]    
Therefore, the eigenvalues of    
 
  are the roots of the characteristic polynomial  
(  
  
 
 
 
    
 
  )  
 
          
where      
 
 
 
  
 
  and     
 
 
 
  
 
 . Thus,  
 
 
  
 
 
 
    
 
   is one of the 
eigenvalues and the other two are the roots of   
 
       . We call them 
 
 
      
 
. We know that   
 
  
 
    and  
 
  
 
  . It follows from the hypotheses 
 
 
,      . Thus,  
 
 and  
 
 have negative real parts. So if  
 
 
  
 
 
 
    
 
    , then 
the equilibrium  
 
 is locally asymptotically stable. This is possible for     as  
 
 and 
 
 
 are independent of  . 
Therefore, we have proved the following theorem.  Differential Equations and Control Processes, № 1, 2013

Theorem 2.4. If  
 
   and 
  
 
 
 
    
 
    , then the equilibrium point  
 
   
 
  
 
    
exists and is locally asymptotically stable. 
As we know the basic reproductive ratio of the virus for the system (1.1) is  
 
 and for 
 
 
   both,  
 
 and  
 
 exist. In this case, we show that the equilibrium point  
 
 is 
globally asymptotical stable in D under the condition  
 
 
  
  
. In order to see this, 
consider the following positive function on  : 
         ∫   
   
 
 
    
   
 
 
 
    
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
where,  
 
   
 
  
 
    as before. Calculating the time derivative of          along the 
positive solutions of the system (1.1) gives

At the equilibrium point   
 
  
 
    we have 
    
 
  
 
   
 
       
 
   
By considering these equalities we can write

Remark 2.1. If Theorem 2.5 holds,

system (1.1).  
 
3  Other Equilibrium Points and Their Stability  
    In this section, we will find the equilibrium points of the system (1.1) for       and  
   
    
  . Then we will consider the stability of these points.  
From 
   
    
   we obtain 
  
       
  
                                                                                                                               
and from the second equation of (2.1) we get  
  
   
 
                                                                                                                           
where        . If    , then the system (1.1) does not have any rest point in  
 
 
. 
Hence we look for a rest point in the set        .    
By substituting    from (3.1) into the first equation of (2.1) we obtain  
            (
       
  
) 
 
                                                                         
Hence if (1.1) has another equilibrium point, it must satisfy in (3.1), (3.2) and (3.3). In 
the following, we discuss in more detail about the existence of such solution. From (3.3) 
we can write 
  (
       
  
) 
 
                                                                               
The right hand side of (3.4) is a straight line and by hypothesis  
 
, the left hand side is a 
concave upward curve with positive values.  
If         , then               is negative in    , but the left hand side of 
(3.4) is positive. Therefore, in this case, the equation (3.4) does not have any solution. 
This means that (3.3) cannot have any solution if         .  
If          and    is very small or        , then as the concavity of 
  (
       
  
) 
 
does not change, the line              intersects the 
curve   (
       
  
) 
 
 in one point or  two points. Hence (3.3) admits at most two 
solutions in    . Notice that the line              is decreasing with respect to 
  and the curve    
       
  
  
 
 is increasing with respect to it. Thus if   decreases these 
two curves may intersect each others in two points.  Differential Equations and Control Processes, № 1, 2013  
 
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal  96 
 If the line is tangent to the curve, then (3.4) and therefore, (3.3) has one solution. Hence 
the system (1.1) admits another rest point. Let  
 
   
 
  
 
  
 
  be this point, where 
 
 
 
      
 
 
  
 
,   
 
 
   
 
   
 
 and  
 
satisfies in (3.4).  
We show the corresponding   to this rest point by  
 
. This number is called the 
immunodeficiency threshold.  
If    
 
, then the line cuts the curve in two different points and  the equation (3.4) has

Since  
 
   we conclude that the real part of one of three roots of the equation (3.14) 
is positive. Hence,  
 
is always unstable.  Therefore we have the following theorem. 
Theorem 3.2. Suppose that the equilibrium  
 
   
 
  
 
  
 
  exist. The equilibrium 
point  
 
is always unstable and the equilibrium point  
 
 is always locally 
asymptotically stable. 
4  Discussion   
The model which is given by the system (1.1) has four possible equilibria:  
 
 
 (
 
 
    )  
 
   
 
  
 
     
 
   
 
  
 
  
 
   
 
   
 
  
 
  
 
   
The basic reproductive number for one infected cell is definable as  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 , which 
represents the average number of cells infected by a single infected cell in an otherwise 
susceptible cell population.  
In a healthy human only activated CD4
+
T cells attain an equilibrium level of   
 
 
. 
This homeostatic equilibrium is designated by  
 
 in the above.  
By Theorem 2.1,  
 
, the uninfected equilibrium or healthy state always exists and by 
Theorem 2.2 for  
 
  , it is the unique equilibrium and  is globally asymptotically 
stable. This means that the infected CD4
+
Tcells decreases to zero.  Differential Equations and Control Processes, № 1, 2013  
 
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal  98 
After infection of HIV, if  
 
  , then infected CD4
+
T cells increase to high level and 
uninfected CD4
+
T cells decrease to a low level. This situation is appeared by the 
infected equilibrium  
 
.  
By Theorem 2.1,  
 
 exists if and only if  
 
  . It is locally asymptotically stable if 
  
 
 
 
    
 
  . In this case the infected equilibrium  
 
 is the steady state of the model. This 
means that infected CD4
+
T cells increase initially to high level and subsequently 
converge to an equilibrium value  
 
 and the activated CD4
+
T cells attain an equilibrium 
level of  
 
. This equilibrium  
 
 represents a state in which the virus load of HIV is 
balanced with no immune response, because of a shortage of activated CD4
+
T cells 
during a primary pose of HIV infection. In this case,  
 
 is designated as the shortage 
state. If  
 
   and 
  
 
 
 
    
 
  , then  
 
 is not acceptable or it is unstable.     
In addition to the two equilibria  
 
 and  
 
, at the end of the primary phase, if CTL 
responses are induced, then the infected cells are regulated by them for a long time at 
some steady state. Actually, if    is large and   is small, then from the equation (3.4) our 
model must have two possible interior equilibria  
 
   
 
  
 
  
 
  and  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  with,  
 
  
 
,  
 
  
 
,  
 
  
 
. However, by Theorem 3.2,  
 
 is 
always unstable if exists. Therefore the equilibrium  
 
 is considered as a controlled 
state, in which effective and sustained CTLs have been established and the virus load is 
suppressed at a low level. In fact if   increases or   decreases,  
 
 tends to a lower level.  
On the other hand, if CTLs are not induced at the end of the primary phase, then 
  
 
 
 
    
 
   and by Theorem 2.4 or 2.5,  
 
 is the only state equilibrium of the model for 
small values of   and large values of  . This means that   infected individuals 
immediately develop AIDS after the acute infection. Consequently, when a complete 
breakdown of the immune system occurs, implying that   converge zero, activated and 
infected CD4
+
T cells also converge to the same equilibrium values  
 
. In this case, the 
steady state  
 
 is called the immunodeficiency state.  
The immune impairment rate is low at the beginning of the infection. Therefore, 
sustained CTL responses are established and the viral replication is suppressed at a low 
level in the stable controlled state  
 
 after the CTL naives begin to expand and 
differentiate. Consequently, the virus load of HIV equilibrates and remains at a 
virological set point immediately after the acute infection.   
By Theorem 3.2,  
 
 always is stable and the shortage state  
 
 is stable in x-y space, but 
is unstable in all space if   is small which implies that convergent steady state of model 
(1.1) always transfers from  
 
 to  
 
 if   becomes positive. Furthermore, even if the 
immune impairment rate,   increases the viral replication is well controlled by CTL 
responses at  
 
 until the rate exceeds the risky threshold  
 
 i.e.   
 
. On the other 
hand, when the impairment rate becomes greater than the immunodeficiency threshold 
(i.e. 
 
  ) the shortage state becomes the immunodeficiency state i.e.  
 
. In this 
situation the immunodeficiency state  
 
 becomes a unique stable steady state of model 
(1.1). This means that the risky zone expands into total space and the patients always 
develop AIDS.

   In this section, we investigate the hypothesis H

 for some famous functional 
responses.  
The following lemma helps us to show easier the concavity of the functional responses. 
Lemma. The function    
 
 (
       
  
) is concave upward if the function   
 
 
    
 
 
  is concave upward.  
Proof: We can write,    
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 . Let   
  
 
 and   
  
 
, then    
 
    
 
 
 . 
Since change of scale of independent variable does not change the concavity of the 
function, the proof is complete.    
i) Lotka-Volterra or Holling I: we let         . For this functional response we have:
