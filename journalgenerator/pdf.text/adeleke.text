Abstract
Criteria for uniform asymptotic stability, boundedness, uniform ultimate boundedness
and asymptotic behaviour of solutions of the most general third order nonlinear differen-
tial equations with the restoring nonlinear terms depending explicitly on the independent
real variable t are established. The construction a complete Lyapunov function, Lya-
punov’s second method, the technique introduced by Antoisewicz [9] and the limit point
of Yoshizawa [29] are used to obtain the results. The most recent results of Ademola and
Arawomo [1, 2, 3, 4] and results on third order nonlinear differential equations which have
been discussed in [18] are particular cases of our results.
Keywords: Third order nonlinear differential equations; Uniform asymptotic stability;
Boundedness; Asymptotic behaviour of solutions
1 Introduction
The theory of differential equations of higher order have been recognized to
be invaluable tools in the modelling of many phenomena in various ﬁelds of
science and engineering. In particular, stability, boundedness and asymptotic
behaviour of solutions of nonlinear third order differential equations have in
the past and also recently been researched. See for instance Reissig et al, [18],Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2012
Rouche et al, [19], Yoshizawa [29, 30] and the papers of Ademola and Ara-
womo[1, 2, 3, 4], Ademolaet al, [5]-[7], Afuwapeand Adesina [8], Chukwu[10],
Ezeilo [11]-[13], Ezeilo and Tejumola [14], Mehri and Shadman [15], Ogundare
[16], Qian [17], Swick [20, 21], Tejumola [22, 23], Tun¸ c [24, 25], Yamamoto[26]-
[28]. These works were done with the aid of Lyapunov functions except in [7]
where frequency domain approach was used.
However, the problem of uniform asymptotic stability, boundedness, uni-
form ultimate boundedness and asymptotic behaviour of solutions where the
restoring nonlinear terms depend explicitly on the independent real variable
t remain unresolved. The aim of this article therefore is to establish criteria
for uniform asymptotic stability, boundedness, uniform ultimate boundedness
and asymptotic behaviour of solutions of the third order nonlinear differential
equation

2 Some Preliminaries
Deﬁnition 1 (i) A function φ :R
+
→R
+
, continuous, strictly increasing with
φ(0) = 0 is said to be a function of class K for such function, we shall write
φ∈K.
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 98Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2012
(ii) If in addition to (i) φ(r) → +∞ as r → ∞, φ is said to be a function of
classK
∗
.
The following lemmas are very important in the proof of the main results.
Consider the system of differential equations
dX
dt
=F(t,X), (2.1)
where X = X(t) is an n−vector. Suppose that F(t,X) is continuous in (t,X)
onR
+
×D, D is a connected open set inR
n
. Let C be the class of solutions of
(2.1) which remain in D.
Lemma 1 [30] Suppose that there exists a Lyapunov function V(t,X) deﬁned
onR
+
,kXk< H which satisﬁes the following conditions:
(i) V(t,0)≡ 0;
(ii) a(kXk)≤V(t,X)≤b(kXk), a,b∈K;
(iii)
˙
V
(2.1)
(t,X)≤−c(kXk) for all (t,X)∈R
+
×D, where c∈K.
Then the trivial solution X(t)≡ 0 of (2.1) is uniformly asymptotically stable.
Now consider the system (2.1) and suppose that F(t,X) is deﬁned and contin-
uous onR
+
×R
n
, we have the following lemma.
Lemma 2 [30] Suppose that there exists a Lyapunov function V(t,X) deﬁned
onR
+
,kXk≥ρ where ρ may be large, which satisﬁes the following conditions:
(i) a(kXk)≤V(t,X)≤b(kXk), a∈K
∗
, b∈K;
(ii)
˙
V
(2.1)
≤−c(kXk) for all (t,X)∈R
+
×R
n
, where c∈K.
Then the solutions of (2.1) are uniformly ultimately bounded.
Next, consider a system of differential equations
dX
dt
=F(t,X)+G(t,X). (2.2)
Let Q be an open set inR
n
and suppose that F,G are continuous onR
+
×Q.
Moreover, suppose that X is continuous and bounded on R
+
, that is, for a
compact set Q
∗
⊂Q, X ∈ Q
∗
for all t∈R
+
, then we have
Z

0
kG(t,X(t))kdt<∞. (2.3)
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 99Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2012
Lemma 3 Suppose that F(t,X) of the system (2.2) is bounded for all t when
X belongstoanarbitrarycompactsetinQ.Moreover,supposethatthereexists
a nonnegative Lyapunov function V(t,X) such that
˙
V
(2.2)
(t,X)≤−W(X), (2.4)
where W(X) is positive deﬁnite with respect to a closed set Ω in the space Q.
Then every bounded solution of (2.2) approaches Ω as t→∞.
3 Statement of Results
The main results in this paper are the following:
Theorem 1 In addition to the basic assumptions on the functions f,g,h and
p appearing in (1.2), suppose that a,a

and for all t≥ 0 :

(ii) b≤g(t,x,y)/y≤b

(iii) h(t,0,0,0) = 0, δ

(t,x,0,0)/x ≤ δ for all x 6=

(t,x,0,z)≥ 0 for all x,y and z;
(vi) f

x
(t,x,y,0)≤ 0 for all x and y;
(vii)
R
∞
0
|p(t,x,y,z)|dt<∞.
Then the solution (x(t),y(t),z(t)) of (1.2) is uniformly ultimately bounded.
Theorem 2 If in addition to the hypotheses of Theorem 1, g(t,0,0) =
p(t,0,0,0)= 0, then the solution (x(t),y(t),z(t)) of (1.2) is uniformly bounded
and satisfy
lim
t→∞
x(t) = 0, lim
t→∞
y(t) = 0, lim
t→∞
z(t) = 0. (3.1)
Theorem 3 Under the hypotheses of Theorem 1, any solution (x(t),y(t), z(t))
of (1.2) with initial condition
x(0)=x

, z(0) = z

for t

|x(t)|≤D, |y(t)|≤D, |z(t)|≤D, (3.3)
for all t ≥ 0, where the constant D > 0 depends on a,b,c,c

as well as on

and on the forcing term p appearing in (1.2).
If p(t,x,y,z)≡ 0, Eq. (1.2) reduces to a particular case
˙ x =y, ˙ y =z, ˙ z =−f(t,x,y,z)z−g(t,x,y)−h(t,x,y,z), (3.4)
with the following result.
Theorem 4 If g(t,0,0) = 0 and hypotheses (i)-(vi) of Theorem 1 hold true,
then the trivial solution of (3.4) is uniformly asymptotically stable.
Corollary 1 (i) If p(t,x,y,z) = p(t)6= 0, p :R
+
→R, the results in Theorem
1, Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 hold true for the particular case
˙ x =y, ˙ y =z, ˙ z =p(t)−f(t,x,y,z)z−g(t,x,y)−h(t,x,y,z).
(ii) Under the hypotheses of Theorem 1 the solutions of (1.2) are ultimately
bounded and satisﬁes (3.3) for all t≥ 0 with D independent of the initial data.
Remark 1 (i) If (1.1) is a constant coeﬃcient differential equation
...
x +
a¨ x + b˙ x + cx = 0, then conditions (i)-(vii) of Theorem 1 reduces to the
Routh-Hurwitz conditions a > 0, ab > c and c > 0. To see this, we set
f(t,x,y,z)=a, g(t,x,y)= by, h(t,x,y,z) =cx and p(t,x,y,z)= 0.
(ii) The results of Qian [17], Yamamoto [26]-[28], Tun¸ c [24] and the recent
works of Ademola and Arawomo [1, 2, 3, 4] and Ademola et al, [6, 7] are
particular case of these results. Besides, the main tools used in [17, 24, 26,
27] and [28] are incomplete Lyapunov functions. Moreover, the complete
Lyapunov functions used in [1]-[6] are special cases of the main tool used
in this investigation.
The main tool used in this paper is the continuously differentiable function
V = V(t,x,y,z) deﬁned as
V =e

Next, we shall show that the function V and its time derivative satisfy
certain inequalities as discussed in the following lemma.

Proof: Clearly V(t,0,0,0) = 0, and since h(t,0,0,0) = 0 for all t ≥ 0, the

By (3.5d) and (3.5e): αb > c; ab > c; a > α and b > β respectively, so that

4 The Proof of The Main Results
Proof of Theorem 1: Let (x(t),y(t),z(t)) be any solution of (1.2). In view
of estimates (3.10), (3.11b) and (3.16), hypotheses of Lemma 2 are satisﬁed.
Hence by Lemma 2, all solutions of (1.2) are uniformly ultimately bounded.
This completes the proof of the theorem.
Proof of Theorem 2: Let (x(t),y(t),z(t)) be any solution of (1.2). We
shall show that all hypotheses of Lemma 3 hold true. Now, from (3.16)
˙
V
(1.2)
(t,x,y,z) ≤ 0 for all t ≥ 0,x,y and z, thus from this inequality and
estimates (3.10) and (3.11b) the solutions of (1.2) are uniformly bounded (see
[30] Theorem 10.2 pp. 38-39).
Next, let W(X) =δ
8
(x
2
+y
2
+z
2
), obviously W(X)≥ 0 for all X = (x,y,z)∈
R
3
. Consider the set
Ω :={X ∈R
3
|W(X) = 0}.
From the continuityofW(X), the set Ω is closed and W(X) is positive deﬁnite
with respect to Ω and
˙
V
(1.2)
(t,X)≤−W(X)
for all (t,X)∈R
+

.
Moreover, system (1.2) can be arranged in the form (2.2) where X = (x,y,z)
T
,
F(t,X) = (y,z,−zf(t,x,y,z)−g(t,x,y)−h(t,x,y,z))
T
and G(t,X) =

T
.Inviewofcondition(vii)ofTheorem1,estimate(2.3)holds.
From the continuity and boundedness of the functions f,g and h, the function
F(t,X) is bounded for all t ∈ R
+
when X belongs to any arbitrary compact
set inR
3
. By Lemma 3 the solutions of (1.2) approaches Ω as t→∞.
Next,weshowthattheset{(0,0,0)}iscontainedinΩast→∞.SinceW(X) =
0 on Ω, we have x(t) = y(t) =z(t) = 0, and system (1.2) becomes
(˙ x, ˙ y, ˙ z)
T
= (0,0,−g(t,0,0)−h(t,0,0,0))
T
+(0,0,p(t,0,0,0))
T
. (4.1)
Since g(t,0,0)= h(t,0,0,0)=p(t,0,0,0)= 0, (4.1) has solution
(x(t),y(t),z(t))
T
= (K

whereK

(i= 1,2,3)is a constant. For (4.2)to remain in Ω as t→∞ we must
have K
1

2
=K
3
= 0. Hence (3.1) follows.
Proof of Theorem 3: Let (x(t),y(t),z(t)) be any solution of (1.2), since
|x|≤ 1+x
2
,|y|≤ 1+y
2
and|z|≤ 1+z

(i) since 0 ≤

that

that

for all t ≥ 0,x,y and z, where we have δ
