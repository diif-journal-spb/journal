Abstract. We provide a mathematical completion of L.Faddeev's hypothesis
1
of the Higgs mechanism without using the Higgs  eld (Higgs bosons) by using
the IQM theory of individual particles. So, we demonstrate mathematically,
basing on the IQM gauge theory, that during each interaction of a given mas-
sive particle with the bosons (during which this particle changes its energy,
momentum and speed), the Goldstone "Mexican hat" potential obtained from
particle's Lagrangian density, appears without necessity to introduce the Higgs
bosons.
Keywords: Quantum Mechanics, Aharonov-Bohm effect, Massive bosons,
Electromagnetism.

Ludwig Faddeev called himself a mathematical physicist whose main interest was in quantum theory. He
believed that the aim of mathematical physics is making discoveries in fundamental physics while using mathe-
matical intuition. He saw Mathematical Physics and Theoretical Physics as competitors although he acknowl-
edged that different methods could be used in either discipline. Faddeev was convinced that physics solved
all the theoretical problems in chemistry, thus 'closing' that science. He believed that mathematics will create
the 'uni ed theory of everything' and 'close' physics as well, which can be seen as quite a radical opinion. He
believed that the more physics uses mathematical methods, the more fundamental this science becomes. He also
claimed that there is only one most important unsolved problem in physics: the microscopic description of the
structure of matter. He said that physics will be ' nished' for him when the theories of gravitation, relativity
and quantum mechanics will be put together into one solid theory.

1 Introduction to the Mass Gap Conjecture in Yang-
Mills Theory
In early 1954, Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills [12] extended the concept of
gauge theory for abelian groups, e.g. quantum electrodynamics, to nonabelian
groups to provide an explanation for strong interactions. The idea was set
aside until 1960, when the concept of particles acquiring mass through symme-
try breaking in massless theories was put forward, initially by Jeffrey Goldstone,
Yoichiro Nambu, and Giovanni Jona-Lasinio. The current version of the orig-
inal Yang-Mills idea is a theory that is known as quantum chromodynamics.
This is a model of the fundamental interactions (and therefore all energy in the
universe) which proposes that all matter and energy is composed of quarks and
their opposites (antiquarks). These interactions are thought to be mediated
by the exchange of massless energy bosons called gluons. In effect, in physics,
classical Yang-Mills theory is a generalization of the Maxwell theory of electro-
magnetism where the chromo-electromagnetic  eld itself carries charges. As a
classical  eld theory it has solutions which travel at the speed of light so that
its quantum version should describe massless particles (gluons).
In order to show these properties of a long-range action of photons, for the
electromagnetic  eld in the vacuum region (where the 4-electric current vector
J = 0), expressed by a contravariant 4-potential vector (gauge  eld),

is a wave function which propagates with the speed of light, so that this elec-

Yukawa [13] found a relation between the mass of the intermediate particle (a

However, the postulated phenomenon of color con nement in the current

. This is "mass gap". This is especially important because the inter-
action of the gauge  elds (called gluons in QCD) and quarks prevent any free
gluons/quarks from ever being seen on their own. The evidence that the mass
gap in the SQM is real comes from renormalization group calculations of the
strength of various interactions; simulations in lattice QCD.
So, Yang-Mills SQM theory proposes the existence of this mass gap in
relation to the strong interactions of elementary particles. Classical versions

of this theory describe gauge  elds with no mass that propagate at the speed of
light (see the D'Alembert homogeneous equation above for the electromagnetic
gauge  eld), that is, in such a gauge theory the bosons has to be massless as are
the photons in the gauge theory of electromagnetic force. The SQM describes
every particle as a certain kind of wave so the mass gap is a major contradiction
between the two versions of Yang-Mills theory. One of the most important
results obtained for Yang-Mills theory is asymptotic freedom. The relevance
of this result is due to the fact that a Yang-Mills theory that describes strong
interaction and asymptotic freedom permits proper treatment of experimental
results coming from deep inelastic scattering.
Yang-Mills theories met with general acceptance in the physics community
after Gerard 't Hooft, in 1972, worked out their renormalization. Renormaliz-
ability is obtained even if the gauge bosons described by this theory are mas-
sive, as in the electroweak theory, provided the mass is only an "acquired" one,
generated by the Higgs mechanism which we will consider in next in the math-
ematically simpler case of the electromagnetic quantum  eld theory (QFT).
In particle physics, elementary particles and forces give rise to the world
around us. Physicists explain the behaviors of these particles and how they
interact using the Standard Model. Initially, when these models were being
developed and tested, it seemed that the mathematics behind those models,
which were satisfactory in areas already tested, would also forbid elementary
particles from having any mass, which showed clearly that these initial models
were incomplete. As explained previously, in 1964 three groups of physicists
almost simultaneously released papers describing how masses could be given to
these particles, using approaches known as symmetry breaking. This approach
allowed the particles to obtain a mass, without breaking other parts of particle
physics theory that were already believed reasonably correct. This idea became
known as the Higgs mechanism.
The simplest theory for how this effect takes place in nature, and the theory
that became incorporated into the Standard Model, was that if one or more of
a particular kind of " eld" (known as a "Higgs  eld"
2
) happened to permeate
2
Higgs published the  rst explanation of his particle in 1964. The "Higgs  eld" is believed to  ll the entire
known universe and endows all matter with mass. This "explanation" has been proposed by the team of
Englert and Robert Brout, a deceased colleague, who  rst suggested how elementary particles get their mass by
interacting with an invisible  eld that  lls up all of space. Particles that interacts strongly with the "Higgs  eld"
have more mass, and vice versa. But such a hypothesis would generate enormous problems during the creation
of our universe [22] by having universe-killing potential. In effect, the rapid inationary period immediately
after the Big Bang nearly 13.7 billion years ago would have thrown our early universe into chaos, the universe
would have collapsed as the "Big Crunch".

space, and if it could interact with elementary particles in a particular way, then
this would give rise to a Higgs mechanism in nature. In the basic Standard
Model there is one  eld and one related Higgs boson; in some extensions to
the Standard Model there are multiple  elds and multiple Higgs bosons. This
theory is not fully proven also after the famous experiments in CERN, 2012,
and still up to this moment there is no according that these experiments really
found Higgs bosons instead of other composite particles [34]:
"Physicists have spotted the Higgs boson performing a new trick, but one that
brings us no closer to understanding the workings of fundamental particles...
However, despite the work of thousands of researchers around the world, nobody
has been able to  gure out exactly how it does that or why some particles are
more massive than others."
In the years since the "Higgs  eld" and boson were proposed as a way to
explain the origins of symmetry breaking, several alternatives have been pro-
posed that suggest how a symmetry breaking mechanism could occur without
requiring a Higgs  eld to exist. Models which do not include a Higgs  eld or a
Higgs boson are known as Higgsless models, as Faddeev model considered and
completed by the IQM theory in this paper. In these models, strongly inter-
acting dynamics rather than an additional (Higgs)  eld produce the non-zero
vacuum expectation value that breaks electroweak symmetry.
Noted theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking has been convinced that the
Higgs boson would not be found, as he had hoped that a more "elegant" mech-
anism would be found that could explain how particles have mass. It seems
that the negation of necessity for the existence of Higgs boson is unpopular in
the main stream of physicians.
A number of problems for the existence of Higgs scalar zero-spin bosons
and every-present "Higgs  eld" are addressed in, for example [23]. In effect,
the model of strong and electro-weak interactions supplemented by the gravita-
tional interaction and the presence of higher compacti ed dimensions (Kaluza-
Klein, as in my approach), between micro-island particle's metrics, in which
all dynamic "Higgs  elds" are eliminated, can provide a natural framework for
description of elementary particle fundamental interactions as it was supposed
for example in [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 23, 31, 32] but with different ideas.
The fact that the compacti ed extra dimensions can be used for producing the
spontaneous symmetry breaking without Higgs boson has been studied in a
number of papers (see, for example [33]).

1.1 Higgs Mechanism and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
The weak interaction is short-ranged (range around 10
 15
cm) and, in the sta-
tistical quantum mechanics (SQM), it is explained by the mechanism of the
spontaneous symmetry breaking and hence it predicts the massive bosons (W
 
andZ). In this case, fermions can exchange three distinct types of force carriers
known as theW
+
,W
 
, andZ massive bosons. In 1968, Sheldon Glashow, Ab-
dus Salam and Steven Weinberg uni ed the electromagnetic force and the weak
interaction by showing them to be two aspects of a single force, now termed the
electro-weak force. According to the electro-weak theory, at very high energies,
the universe has four  eld components whose interactions are carried by four
massless gauge bosons (each similar to the massless photon). However, at low
energies, this gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the U(1) sym-
metry of electromagnetism. In the SQM theory, this symmetry-breaking would
be expected to produce three massless bosons, but instead they become inte-
grated by the other three  elds and acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism.
These three boson integrations produce theW
+
,W
 
, andZ bosons of the weak
interaction. The fourth gauge boson is the photon of electromagnetism, and
remains massless.
The aspects of gauge symmetries are based on the  eld transformations
' 7! e
i 
' where   is a constant in the case of global and a function on
time-space r
4
= (t;
  !
r ) of local symmetries. The complex phase of a  eld
does not appear as a measurable quantities, so that the states described by a
different complex phase are physically the same and differ only in mathematical
description, so that the global U(1) symmetry, with e
i 
2 U(1), is a gauge
symmetry. There is a well known theorem related to the global symmetry
breaking: Goldstone theorem, which tells that every broken generator of a
global symmetry group has a corresponding massless Goldstone boson (with
spin zero). Let us consider a thin rod with circular cross section, in Fig.1,
and apply a force F on the end points of the rod. If the force F is small,
nothing happens. However, if F exceeds a critical value F
0
, the rod bends in a
plane which it chooses at random as shown in Fig.1. The symmetric (unbent)
con guration becomes unstable when F > F
0
, and the new ground state is
unsymmetric. Also, there are in nitely many possible new degenerate ground
states, which are related by a rotational symmetry. The rod can only, of course,
choose one of them, but the others are all reached by a rotation without causing
any energy. So we obtained the typical restatement of Goldstone theorem.
Notice that this is valid also when ' is the 3-D wave-packet  eld 	 =

complementary to the SQM theory), because the de Broglie pilot-wave phase

Let us consider a simple  led theory example: broken U(1) symmetry. A
general Lagrangian for a single complex scalar  eld ' has the form (in what
follows we will use Einstein convention for the sum above the indexes, in order
to make simpler the presentation and explanation of the main concepts),

where the  rst term is the kinetic component of the Lagrangian, invariant under
globalU(1) transformations, andV ('') is the potential invariant under trans-
formation as well. Let us show thatV is indeed a potential density component
of the Lagrangian densityL = T V , where T is its "kinetic" component.
In fact, from the Lagrangian density (3), we obtain the conjugate moments of
the complex  eld ' and ',   =

The orientation of these states is comparable to the direction of alignment

to be the ground state of the physical system (analogously to the direction
of the plain de ned by the compressed rod in Fig.1), and the ground states
are related to each other by the U(1) symmetry of the Lagrangian. For this
Goldstone potential, the Lagrangian density (3) is invariant under global U(1)
symmetry, where Q is the conserved charge for the  eld ',

invariant under this transformation, the ground state is not invariant under it,

1.2 Gauge Invariance and Local Symmetries
A key innovation of the 20th century was Herman Weyl's invention of gauge
theory, in which a global physical symmetry is replaced by a local one; the arbi-
trary phase in Hamiltonian-based quantum wave function becomes a function
of time-space, a change that requires the existence of the electromagnetic gauge
 eld. Weyl's gauge method, where the global symmetry is transformed into a lo-
cal one, applied to the Standard-Model symmetry groupSU(3) SU(2) U(1),
is enough in the SQM theory to yield the strong, weak and electromagnetic in-
teractions.
It is well known the relativistic invariance or Poincare symmetry and the
internal symmetry based on the Lie group U(1) symmetry of phase transfor-
mations (the conservation of matter and, dually, of electric charge for Dirac
equation). Analogously, we can consider the isospin symmetry SU(2) (used
for the electroweak force interactions) and the avour symmetry SU(3) of the
strong force interactions. All of them are continuous global symmetry trans-
formations (they give rise to conserved currents and charges as described by
Noether's theorem, that is, they presuppose that, at least in principle, we can
measure all the components of a  eld 	 at all points
  !
r in space at the same
time.
However, here we have to consider the theories which are invariant if the
symmetry operations are performed locally where the transformation parame-
ters are dependent on local space coordinates (for example, if the rotation angle
  of Lorentz transformation is not constant for all in nitesimal pieces of matter
 
m
= 		, but is dependent on its space position
  !
r , that is, the rotation angle
is a function  (
  !
r )). A gauge theory is a theory where the action is invariant
under a continuous group symmetry that depends on time-space and such local
symmetries introduce these gauge  elds to the theory which mediate a force.
Let us consider, for instance, the internal phase transformation, when   is not
a constant phase, but depends on space position
  !
r , and when we require that
the Lagrangian densityL in equation (22) be invariant under such local smooth
changes of phase:

(8)
However, since the Lagrangian densityL is invariant under global internal sym-
metry when  is constant, it is not invariant under local phase transformations
given by (8). The problem is that the derivatives of the  eld 	 does not trans-

If we want to consider the phase transformations  (

This problem is analog to the problem of the derivation of a vector  eldW, with

, along a particular curve
lying in a given manifold in the differential geometry. In contrast to differential
geometry, the vector  eld 	 are not vectors in the tangent space (plane) of

We require that the physics do not depend on the local choice of the basis,
so that the differentiation has to be de ned based on the change of 	 (or 	)

Historically, while trying to explain the quantum effects of electrodynamics, it was found that Quantum
Electrodynamic (QED) could be explained by a U(1) Abelian gauge theory. Yang and Mills then generalized
this Abelian U(1) gauge theory to the non Abelian gauge theory case (with the self interactions).

standard model of elementary particles, which is based on the concept of local
gauge invariance, has shown to be very successful theory. Let us consider a

on time-space, in the gauge theory for the electromagnetism. The gauge boson
in this model becomes massive through spontaneous symmetry breaking of the
photon. For the stable massless bosons we have the long range electromagnetic
force. A situation in which photons are massive is, for example, in a super-
conductor where U(1) gauge (local) symmetry is spontaneously broken. The
Higgs mechanism (in the original case of the non-Abelian gauge theories such as
SU(2) U(1) gauge symmetry that describes the electroweak interaction, this
mechanism allows the W
 
and Z bosons to be massive) explains how a  eld
with an (asymmetric) non-zero ground state can be source of massive gauge
bosons. The Lagrangian for the Higgs  eld 	, in the case of electromagnetism,

"eaten" by the gauge  eld. To verify that indeed 	 =V

This mechanism, by which spontaneous symmetry breaking generates a
mass for a gauge boson, was explored and generalized to the non-Abelian case
by Higgs, Kibble, Guralnik, Hagen, Brout and Englert, and is now known as
the Higgs mechanism.
The role of the "pick a gauge"  xing in the breakdown of the Goldstone the-
orem can give insight into the position of gauge (local) symmetry breaking w.r.t.
global symmetry breaking. In current ensemble interpretation of the statisti-
cal theory of the Standard Model (SQM), three massless Goldstone bosons are
generated, which are absorbed to give masses to the W
 
and Z gauge bosons.
The remaining component of the complex doublet becomes the Higgs boson- a
new fundamental scalar (0-spin) boson.
Remark: Such a solution with this "pick a gauge" can not be used if we con-
sider 	 as the particle's wave-packet of the energy density, where the complex
component is the particle's pilot-wave which can not be a constant for the mas-
sive particles (only for the massless bosons it is constant phase). Thus, for the
massive bosons theory provided in Section 3 we need an alternative approach
to the Higgs mechanism.
2 Fadeev's Interepretation of the Higgs Mechanism
The question of the Higgs  eld's existence has been the last unveri ed part
of the Standard Model of particle physics and, according to some, "the central
problem in particle physics". In the Standard Model of SQM, the Higgs particle
is a boson with no spin, electric charge, or color charge. It is also very unstable,
decaying into other particles almost immediately. It is a quantum excitation
of one of the four components of the Higgs  eld. A number of authors [11,
19, 20, 21] have been suggested, and Higgs himself, that the Higgs mechanism
can be described without spontaneous symmetry breaking, in a gauge invariant
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru 103Differencialnie uravnenia i protsesy upravlenia, N 3, 2022
independent way, from the fact that the Higgs mechanism relies on the zero
ground state value of the Higgs  eld.
The procedure used previously to describe the Higgs mechanism, uses an
explicit "pick a gauge"  xing, by requiring that 	j
r
4
=V
0
+ (r
4
), thereby set-
ting the imaginary part of to zero. But this gauge  xing gets rid of the gauge
symmetry and thus obscures the meaning of gauge symmetry breaking. How-
ever, Higgs demonstrated in the 3rd paper on the mass of gauge bosons in 1966
that the Higgs mechanism can be described in an alternative gauge-invariant
way, that is, in the gauge independent accounts of the Higgs mechanism. This
procedure forSU(2) U(1), leavingU(1) symmetry in the Lagrangian, is given
recently in [9, 11, 19], but for the conceptual understanding of the role of gauge
symmetry the U(1) model (of electrodynamics) is su cient, as follows. The
starting point is again theU(1) gauge invariant Lagrangian for 	
4
theory as in
equation (15). Here the set of  elds (A
j
; 	) is transformed to the set of new
 elds (B

whereB

scalar  elds. These transformations look similar to the transformations in (17)
that determined the "pick a gauge"  xing, but are not the same. The difference
is that now  (r
4
) is one of the variable  elds. While in (17) after gauge  xing,
the gauge transformation can not longer be applied to  elds, now the gauge
is not  xed and gauge transformation can be applied to the  elds. Thus a

pure gauge variable. It is only one in the set of new  elds that is not gauge

"Higgs  eld"  (r

scalar  eld can be substituted by the real positive density   =

of the
particle's rest-mass energy-density

). The model is renormalizable from the
gauge invariance of the LagrangianL (a proof for this is established by 't Hooft
at 1970).
Thus, this approach where spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking has no
role, is more general and guarantee the renormalization, but also well suited for
the IQM  eld theory of the particles developed in [2, 3, 4]. Both approaches,
that earlier, based on the spontaneous symmetry breaking, and this new one
based on the gauge invariant Higgs mechanism, have one crucial element in
common: the non-zero vacuum expectation value of the  eld  (r

damental question that previous work for the Higgs mechanism did not answer
is why and how the "Higgs  eld" has a non-zero vacuum expectation (average)

i. In Faddeev paper [11], he writes:
"Thus, one way or another we see, that the nonzero expectation value for
the

can be invoked without the Higgs potential. The fundamental question
remains, is the origin of the excitations for the  eld  . In both interpretations
the most natural answer is massless scalar - analogy of dilation in the  rst
interpretation or kind of Goldstone model in the second. I hope, that more
experienced phenomenologist can consider seriously this hypothesis."
My answer is that   is the excitation  eld with

	(r

grangian density, (only) during the interaction with a boson, explained in Sec-
tion 4, obtains the form of the Goldstone "Mexican hat" potential.

3 BasicEquationsandInteractionProcessesintheIQM
Theory
Quantum mechanics, based on the Schr odinger equation is an epistemic statis-
tical theory, here denominated as Statistical Quantum Mechanics (SQM), to
differentiate it from the new part of the ontological quantum theory, provided
in [2, 3] and [4], denominated Individual particles Quantum Mechanics (IQM).
Both of them are necessary components of the quantum theory, as are the Clas-
sical Mechanics for Individual objects (ICM),based on the Newton equations,
Hamiltonian-Jacobi equations or the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion of in-
dividual objects) and the Statistical Classical Mechanics (SCM), based on the
Liouville equations.
In the IQM theory there is a deeper speci cation of the state of the particle,
and in this approach to completion provided in [2], these states are speci ed by
the energy-density distributions of a given particle in the Minkowski time-space.
Such an ontic state, also not fully accessible (non fully observable by the mea-
surements, and/or with non accessible small compacti ed higher-dimensions
for the electric charge (5th timelike dimension with the coordinate q
4

)
and spin (6th spacelike dimension with the coordinate q
5
), for example), has
to represent the complete description of an individual elementary particle, in
order to be able to compute from it all properties of a particle as its rest-mass,
position, speed, momentum, total energy, etc...
It was shown [1, 7, 8, 2, 10] that, generally, any massive particle can be
de ned in the Minkowski time-space (we will not use the real higherdimensional
expressions but only its reduced forms to the 4-D representation) with the
signature (+; ; ; ), by the complex wave-packet

As shown in [2], during an inertial propagation when the particle is in a hydro-
static equilibrium, we have that  
m
is spherically symmetric around particle's
barycenter with
  !
u (t;
  !
r ) = 0 in every point inside particle's matter, so that ev-
ery in nitesimal amount of  
m
propagates with the constant wave-packet group
velocity
  !
v . Only during the particle's accelerations we have that
  !
u (t;
  !
r )6= 0,
so that particle's body changes dynamically its shape in time.
In the assumption [2] of the topology of the matter of an elementary massive
particle, the wave-packet do not undergo a spreading, also when it changes its
matter density distribution (i.e., its energy-density  
m
), and tends to its stable
stationary spherically symmetric distribution during inertial propagation in the
vacuum. That is, the matter has some internal self-gravitational autocohesive
force analogously to the peace of perfect uid in the vacuum, so that at any
instance of time, the 3-D space topology of particle's matter distribution, and
consequently its compressible energy-density  
m
is simply connected, closed,
continuous and differentiable.

Thus, each massive elementary particle satis es the following Noether's conser-
vation laws:
Analogously to the Euler  rst equation of uid dynamics (continuity equation),
which represents the conservation of mass, here we have the analog equation

It holds also for bosons when they become unstable after an initial 'space ex-
plosion' and, consequently, assume the massive particle behavior and a  nite
but non-zero energy-density volume in open 3-D space. We need that the body
of the particle  
m
provides also the physical internal pressureP (t;
  !
r ) (which is
a non-geometrical property) in order to guarantee the hydrostatic equilibrium
of the massive particles. The hydrostatic equilibrium of an massive elementary
particle demonstrated that the body of this particle  
m
is a material substance
[6], which is uid and elastic, and which can not be reduced to the time-space
geometry.
Hence, in this IQM theory [2] for individual elementary particles based on
energy-density wave-packets, the point-like particles are only the stable-state
bosons when they propagate with speed of light in the vacuum, and with their
energy-density distributed in higher compacti ed dimensions [3]. In Section 2.7
in [2], dedicated to the 3-D radial expansion of the bosons w.r.t. the direction
of particle's propagation, to the tunneling and reections, has been considered

So, from (26) the volume of the massless boson in the ordinary 3-dimensional
space is equal to zero. Only in such conditions a particle can travel with the
maximal possible speed of light. But the matter/energy of the boson exists
also in such conditions: it is uniformly distributed only in the spacelike sixth
dimension (used for the spin) where it propagates with a constant speed v
5
.
Consequently, the hidden matter of a boson in the compacti ed higher dimen-
sions results in zero rest-mass in the ordinary at Minkowski time-space and
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru 109Differencialnie uravnenia i protsesy upravlenia, N 3, 2022
explains why the boson can propagate with maximal possible speed. During
this massless stable-state, the gravitational anti-black-hole barrier acting in the
boson's barycenter (in 3-D space) does not permit the leaking of the matter
from 6th into ordinary 3-dimensional space.
We consider the vacuum as the perfect 3-dimensional space symmetry where
each possible direction of the propagation has the same physical conditions.
Thus, the propagation of the particles in the vacuum is inertial and the par-
ticle propagates along GR geodesics with constant speed as a stable particle
4
.
The asymmetry due to the presence of an in nitesimal inertial particle in at
Minkowski spacetime is purely circumstantial, because the spacetime is consid-
ered to be unaffected by the presence of this particle. However, according to
general relativity, the presence of any inertial entity disturbs the symmetry of
the manifold even more profoundly, because it implies an intrinsic curvature of
the spacetime manifold, i.e., the manifold takes on an intrinsic shape that dis-
tinguishes the location and rest frame of the particle. Note that, from the fact
that the stable bosons have no matter/energy in the ordinary 3-dimensional
(open) space, the stable bosons do not generate any local time-space curva-
ture, differently from the fermions. Thus, the local time-space neighborhood
of a massless boson is always a locally at Minkowski time-space, differently
from the fermions (and also unstable massive bosons). The fact that the sta-
ble bosons have no any curved island-metrics in the ordinary 4-dimensional
time-space, results in missing of any physical resistance of the neighborhood
time-space to their propagation (differently from the massive particles with
energy-density present in the 4-dimensional time-space and, generated from it,
curved micro-island metrics). Consequently, they propagate with maximal pos-
sible speed in the ordinary 4-dimensional time-space. Thus, the bosons have the
point-like 4-dimensional structure corresponding to their position (barycenter),
but physically their total energy-density is

=const.
But there are the situations when a stable, stationary, boson becomes ex-
cited for a short interval of time, as in the situations when the space symmetry
during its propagation is sharply broken. Thus, the time-space boundary condi-
tions for the particle's propagation are drastically changed, by considering that
particle's wave-packet is a time-space perturbation and, if such a perturbation
meets another perturbation, it changes its form. These events we analyzed in
details for the phenomena of refraction and 'wave-behaviors' of an individual

photon [2]. In all these situations a photon may change its momentum, direc-
tion of propagation and its velocity, without changing its total energy, because
these 'interactions' are not based on collisions with another particles (as Comp-
ton effects, or annihilations), but on instantaneous 3-D space expansions of their
geometric wave-packet scalar  eld   in the presence of a local sharply broken
space symmetry. These are strong General Relativity effects correlated with
the particle's 'micro-island' curvature metrics, caused by a dynamical changing
of the boundary conditions in the local space around this particle.
The interactions between any two wave-packets (particles) can be obtained
only by their local collisions. In dependence on their energy and velocities, they
can produce a kind of Compton's effects (elastic collisions) in which they survive
the collisions by changing their momentum and energy (with the conservation
of total momentum and energy), or they can produce a total fusion with a
possible creation of the new stable particles (in Feynman's diagrams).
Thus, for any two massless bosons with the Dirac function energy-
distributions, it is impossible to have the collisions during their stable states,
but only when they are excited and involved in their temporary 3-D "spatial
explosions". Such 3-D spatial explosions can happen also when two stable
particles are at a very small mutual distance, during which the ideal spatial
symmetry for a free particle in the vacuum does not hold more for both of
them. The bosons have a physical role as the intermediators between the mas-
sive particles (that have the rest-mass and the 3-D volumeV
t
greater than zero),
that is, they are a quantum-source that generates the  elds (the phenomena
as electromagnetic  elds are the statistical results of actions of a high number
of photons). In the case when the bosons are massless (long range interactions
as for massless photons) then we have no the signi cant interference between
themselves. This situation can be obtained at the quantum level only if the col-
lisions between photons, for example, are practically improbable. Consequently,
a number of photons can coexist in the same small 3-D region of space without
any signi cant direct interference between them, heaving contemporarily the
collisions with fermions which have the rest-mass and volume V
t
greater than
zero. Also in such a situation, we can have the rare cases of the interference
between the photons. In normal situations, these interferences statistically can
be neglected, while in the cases of very strong  eld interactions (when the local
density of photons is extremely high) these inter-boson's interactions are sig-
ni cant. Thus, we have the following assumption:

In next section we will apply these results of the IQM theory of an indinvidual
particle to Higgs mechanism.
4 Gauge Invariant Higgs Mechanism without Higgs
Field in the IQM theory
The Higgs mechanism describes how the (general) gauge  eld A
 
=
(A
0
;A
1
;A
2
;A
3
) can be massive. First of all, from this equation, the gauge
 eld on the particle's trajectory (a world line in the Minkowski time-space),
that is, in the points (t;
  !
r
T
(t))2M
4
is expressed by the observed massive par-
ticle complex  eld 	, so that this gauge  eld at least at the particle's barycenter
is always massive  eld. Hence, the bosons of this gauge  eld when become very
near to the moment of the collision with this observed massive particle (that
is, to the particle's barycenter) must be in an unstable massive-boson's state.
In this way, the interaction-dynamics assumption in previous Section (that the
interactions between the bosons and fermions are achieved only by massive
states of these bosons) is con rmed. The second important fact is that the
Higgs mechanism is always presented during such interactions of fermions and
bosons (i.e., the emission/absorbption of bosons). So, the Goldstone potential
V (		) must be implicitly contained in the gauge theory of interactions for the
particle's  eld 	 and its Lagrangian.
Let us show that it is indeed so, and that the interaction of any massive
particle  eld 	 with any gauge- eld boson (their collision), which modi es par-
ticle's pilot-wave phase'
T
(i.e., its total energy and momentum) and hence its
path (trajectory), is a manifestation of the Goldstone "Mexican hat" potential.
Here we will demonstrate that in this new IQM theory for an individual massive
particle, we have the following facts:
1. The mathematical concept of the "spontaneous symmetry breaking" here
is replaced by the physical concept of the 3-D symmetry breaking of a
massless (Goldstone) boson into a massive boson, when this boson col-
lides (interacts) with this massive particle represented by the rest-mass
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru 113Differencialnie uravnenia i protsesy upravlenia, N 3, 2022
energy density wave-packet 	. Physically, the interactions between a bo-
son (an intermediate particle of a given quantum  eld) with a massive
particle happen always with the previous 3-D symmetry breaking for the
boson's propagation (just before the collision with this massive particle).
The perfect 3-D symmetry for a boson's propagation we have only in the
conditions when it is enough far from the other massive particles, so that
in the vacuum it has a stable form of a massless boson which propagates
with the speed of light.
2. Thus, we do not need any kind of the "Higgs  eld", as supposed in the
SQM theory in order to provide the mass to the Goldston massless bosons.
In the IQM theory, it is exactly the rest-mass energy wave-packet 	 of a
given fermion, which interacts with the bosons of the gauge  elds, and the
rest-mass of such fermion is equal to m
0
=
1
c
2
R
		dV . The short-range
bosons are massive bosons. However, also the ordinary massless bosons,
before the impact with a massive particle, become massive (caused by the
3-D symmetry breaking on their trajectory), and hence any interaction
between a fermion and boson happens always in the condition when this
boson is in massive unstable state (thus with 3-D volume of their energy
density).
3. The Goldstone "Mexican hat" potential V =

of the fermion's complex wave-packet 	, caused by the collision of this
fermion with a massive boson of a given external  eld. The Lagrangian
density of free massive particle does not have Goldstone "Mexican hat" po-
tential component, because in this case of constant particle's speed   = 0,
and this potential component is reduced to V =

the free particle, when it propagates with a constant speed, so that the

So, each local symmetry transformation corresponds necessarily to a par-
ticle's acceleration, caused by the interaction of this massive particle with
a boson of a given external  eld. Thus, for an individual particle in the
IQM theory, the global and local symmetry transformations have a clear
distinct physical meaning.
With this new IQM theory, we obtain a simpli cation of the Standard Model
with a diminution of number of basic elementary particles: we do not need the
Higgs bosons in our quantum theory, but each massless boson can be trans-
formed into a massive boson, in particular during the emission of the bosons
from a massive particle and during the absorption of the bosons, presented
in details in the case of electrically charged particles in [10]. Now, with the
dimensionally correct version of the Lagrangian density (22), we may rewrite
particle's Lagrangian density for the normalized  elds
 =
	
p

(in order to have the direct relationship with the theory SQM and hence
R

potential.
However, during the impact of the boson with this massive particle, in
the open interval of time (t
0
;t
0
+  t), we have no more a free propagating
particle but two possible scenarios: acceleration or deceleration of this massive
particle during the collision with this massive boson. So, from Proposition
1 Section 3, we have that during this  nite interval  t of time, the particle's
wave-packet 	 (thus also its normalization ) undergoes a local symmetry
transformation 7! e

along its trajectory, such that the equation (31)
reduces to,   =

By considering that on the particle's trajectory (that is, in the particle's

During this extremely short interval of interaction  t, we have two possible

From the general global U(1) transformation (5), it holds that the charge Q is

the ground state is not, and an in nitesimal   =  t (which is a translation of

obtain the new state of the free particle in the time instance t + t. Note that
this ground statej0i corresponds to the zero external potential in the vacuum,
where particle has an inertial propagation as a free particle. So, this state can
be called as "vacuum state" of a given individual massive particle (as it is called
in the SQM) as well.

Thus, in this simplest global U(1) case, we have only one broken generator
Q, but this does not correspond to the massless Goldstone boson. Instead, here
in IQM, it corresponds to the absence of any interaction of this particle with a
boson.
As in the SQM  eld theory, the oscillations around the ground state, or "vac-
uum" (corresponding to the hydrostatic equilibrium of a free particle), corre-
spond to the real massive particle during its accelerations (with particle's 3-D
expansion/compression around its spherically symmetric hydrostatic equilib-
rium). Let us consider now the perturbation

i (t;

(37)
around the ground state, where   and   (de ned on the particle's trajectory

malized) wave packet

T
j
t
(38)
where the momentum, velocity and total energy of this particle change in the
interval t
0
< t < t
0
+ t. It is easy to verify that, if we substitute 
0
in the
Lagrangian density (35) on the particle's trajectory, we obtain that  (r
4
) is
massive  eld (as expected from the fact that (V
0
+ (r
4
) is the square root of
the particle's rest-mass energy density), without a necessity to introduce the
new "Higgs  eld". The  eld  (t;
  !
r
T
(t)) results massless, but not because it
represents a massless Goldston boson. It is a massless  eld, because physically
it does not correspond to another particle, and its negative value corresponds
to the de Broglie pilot-wave phase of the observed massive particle

in the
IQM theory.
This perturbation above can be de ned as a local symmetry U(1) transfor-

The freedom to "pick up" the  (t;
  !

T
(t)) by (38) is based on the fact
that particle's de Broglie phase '
T
represents the universal property of the
nature that the propagation of an object is governed by minimal action of its
Lagrangian L, and such principle remains invariant is we add to L any real
constant energy E

Hence, any local symmetry breaking, which happens only during the col-
lision of a massive particle with a boson of an external  eld (this boson, if it
was previously massless, long-range, before the impact with this massive par-
ticles experiments a 3-D symmetry breaking on its trajectory during which it
becomes a massive boson, without requiring any "Higgs  eld") generates the
Goldons "Mexican hat" potential on the particle's trajectory. Moreover, we
have no any appearance of the Goldon massless boson, and hence we have no
physically any mysterious phenomena that it is "eaten" by the gauge  eld to
become the massive boson. In the IQM, theW
 
andZ are ordinary short-range
massive bosons. They obtain their mass by the process of expansion of their
energy-density from the higher compacti ed dimensions into the ordinary open
3-D dimensions, and hence, from the massless boson with the zero 3-D volume
of their energy-density, they become massive (and so inertial) particles with a
small 3-D volume of their energy-density. Thus, we demonstrated the following
property for an interaction of a massive particle with some external  eld boson:
Corollary 1 During the interaction of a massive particle with a gauge vector
boson (its emission or absorption), in an extremely small time interval [t  t;t],
the Lagrangian densityL on the trajectory of this accelerated particle corre-
sponds to the Goldstone "Mexican hat" LagrangianL
mh
, without introducing
any new auxiliary "Higgs  eld".
Proof: The previous derivation of the Goldstone "Mexican hat" Lagrangian
in (35) from the particle's Lagrangian density (32) during interaction with a
single boson during in nitesimal interval of time [t;t + t].
 
Let us see now how these results are correlated with the previously described
gauge invariant Higgs Mechanism which used the transformation of the original
 elds (A
j
; 	) into the set of Faddeev's  elds (B
j
;  ; ) in (19). From the fact
that our gauge theory is de ned only for the time-space points of the barycenter
of the observed massive particle which interacts with bosons, we have to reduce
also the equations used in the gauge invariant Higgs mechanism theory to the
points lying on the particle's trajectory only. So, in the equations in (19), the

phase  (r
4
)   (t;
  !
r ) reduces to  (t;
  !
r
T
(t)) which is only a function of time
t, and hence we can set    '
T
j
t
to the massive particle pilot-wave phase.
Thus, the "Higgs  eld" 	 in equation (19) reduces to the massive particle's
 eld (wave-packet) 	j
r
4
=  (r
4
) e
i (r
4
)
=  (r
4
) e
 i'
T
.
From the fact that in our gauge theory introduced shortly in Section 3, the
gauge  eldA
j
is a massive  eld (of massive bosons), also this new gauge  eldB
j
must be massive as required by the gauge invariant Higgs mechanism. But we
also obtained that the "Higgs  eld" 	 is not any new particular  eld, but only
the  eld of the observed massive particle's wave-packet during its interaction
with the gauge- eld bosons. In effect, we do not need any new particular "Higgs
 eld" and hence we do not need the so called Higgs bosons.
In the IQM theory we obtained that the "mass constant"   is entirely
determined by the observed massive particle, while the positive constant  
appears only during the collision of this massive particle (with its energy density
 
m
) with a massive gauge- eld boson which produces a modi cation of massive-
particle pilot-wave phase by the real component of    and the modi cation of
the energy-density distribution of observed particle by the imaginary component
of    (directly expressed by the componentsA
j
of the gauge  eld). Thus,   is
a coupling constant of the mutual interaction of this observed massive particle
and the bosons of the gauge  eld, and only in such an interaction we obtain the
famous Jeffrey Goldstone potential V (		). So, the concept of "spontaneous
symmetry breaking" can be substituted by a physical effect of the real 3-D space
symmetry breaking during the propagation of a boson, when the presence of a
massive particle on the boson's trajectory breaks the perfect vacuum 3-D space
symmetry, and causes the 3-D space explosion of this boson during which the
boson's energy-density is expanded from the extra compacti ed dimensions into
the ordinary 3-D space by causing the mass- xation of this boson.
This is the explanation of the Mass gap conjecture in Yang-Mills theory. So,
the massive bosonsW
 
andZ are the unstable states of the Goldstone massless
weak-force gauge bosons. From the fact that these bosons are massive when
they are emitted from the massive elementary particles and that in a very short
time are absorbed by them, in such a short interval of time of their propagation
they remain unstable short-range and hence massive during all their life-time.
In this new completed picture, the framework is different than in SQM:
the LagrangianL in (22) is the sum ofL
free
(of the free particle) andL
gauge
,
and express the interaction of an individual massive particle with any individual
boson (of these four bosons de ned by Lagrangian componentL
gauge
) at a given
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru 120Differencialnie uravnenia i protsesy upravlenia, N 3, 2022
interval of time [t;t + t], just during the emission/absorbtion of this boson.
Thus, the masses of the three bosons W
+
, W
 
and Z, computed by the SQM
Pauli-matrices based Lagrangian are that of this new framework, from the fact
that each rest-mass of these three bosons is invariant and remains equal also
in the moment of direct collision with the observed massive particle (source or
target object for these bosons). Thus, during this interval of time these massive
bosons do not reach a perfect 3-D symmetry of the propagation in the vacuum.
In the case of the photon there is a fundamental difference instead. In the SQM
Pauli-matrices Lagrange framework, the state of this photon is its de nite state
after the electroweak interaction. That is, when the photon is relatively far from
its source (massive particle) and hence it is already transformed from its massive
unstable state into the ordinary stable massless photon (after an acceleration
to the speed of light) which propagates in the vacuum (far from other massive
particles) and hence in the conditions of the 3-D spatial symmetry. In the
new IQM framework, this photon is considered just in the moment when it is
emitted or absorbed, thus in its massive unstable state described by theL
gauge
component.
5 Conclusions
An individual massive particle which interacts with a given gauge massive bo-
son (during its emission or absorbtion), changes its pilot-wave phase '
T
by the
real component  
R
(t) of phase transformation   (t;
  !
r ) caused by this boson's
gauge  eld (in a local gauge symmetry of the Lagrangian), during this boson's
emission/absorbtion, thus on the particle's trajectory. The imaginary compo-
nent   
I
(t;
  !
r ) represents the modi cation of the distribution of the particle's
energy-density during interaction with a boson.
This process is equal for any kind of interactions of the massive particles and
the gauge bosons. Thus, it is a general process where the Goldstone "Mexican
hat" appears in the Lagrangian density which describes the interaction of the
massive particle's  eld 	 (so that there is no any new "Higgs  eld") with any
kind of vector bosons.
The Standard model in this completed theory is modi ed only by this fact
that this theory do not need the Higgs boson, and by the fact that also QM
for the particles, de ned as the complex scalar  elds 	 =  (t;
  !
r )e
 '
T
(wave-
packets with the pilot-wave phase '
T
, where  
m
=  
2
is the rest-mass energy
density in the 3-D space) is a deterministic theory as the classical mechanics.

Acknowledgment: I am so glad that my work in quantum  eld IQM the-
ory has a direct connection with the work of Ludwig Faddeev. I will cite the
interview of Faddeev in 9 July 2015, when he was 81 years old, published by
YouTube (Delta Insitute for Theoretical Physics), "The gosts of Ludvig Fad-
deev",
"I think that the sting theory, for instance, did not show that it has future.
Unfortunately, well, the new generation of young people in America, they where
pressed very much by there own censors that they have to do only string theory...
Do what you want, if it is possible. As much as you want, as is possible. And
read lots."
In fact, all my published papers and last three books by Nova Science,
cited here, are dedicated to this unsolved problem in physics, by developing the
complementary part of statistical QM for individual particles (the IQM theory),
that is, the microscopic description of the structure of matter.
