In Memoriam of Gennady A. Leonov: Editor-in-Chief of
Differential Equations and Control Processes Journal
Gennady A. Leonov (1947-2018)
Gennady Alekseevich Leonov, Editor-in-Chief (2010-2018) of the journal of
Differential Equations and Control Processes, passed away on April 23, 2018
after a short battle with a grievous illness. The proli c life of Gennady Leonov as
a scholar and educator ended tragically at the zenithal time of his indisputable
scienti c creativity and academic leadership. He was a laureate of the State
Prize of USSR (1986), a Corresponding member of Russian Academy of Sciences
(2006), a foreign Member of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters (2017),
a Highly Cited Researcher of Russian Federation (2016, 2017), and a bearer ofDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2018
many notable awards and well-deserved recognitions

.
Gennady Leonov was born in St. Petersburg ( at that time Leningrad) on
February 2, 1947. Just as many ambitious youths of his generation, Gennady
combined factory work during the day with studies in the evening to allow for a
fast track (two vs. three years) graduation from high school followed by highly
competitive enrollment (1964) into the cohort of mathematics students at the
Mathematics and Mechanics Faculty of Leningrad State University, the very
place he would later be Dean for 30 years (1988-2018). In 1969, Gennady began
his post-graduate studies within the scienti c group of V.A. Yakubovich at the
Leningrad State University [1,2]. In 1971, under the supervision of A.Kh. Gelig
he defended, ahead-of-schedule, his Candidate of Science dissertation in which
a negative answer to a famous in control theory Azermans conjecture was given
in the most general case. Gennady then joined a newly developed Department
of Theoretical Cybernetics (chaired by V.A. Yakubovich) as assistant profes-
sor in 1971 and was soon promoted to associate professor. In 1983, Gennady
Leonov defended the second (Doctor of Science) dissertation titled \Stability in
the Whole", and became full professor in 1985. By carrying on and expanding
work by V.A. Yakubovich and V.A. Pliss, his major academic forefathers, and,
at the same time, drawing on the ideas rooted in the school of A.A. Andronov,
Professor Leonov was able to establish his own scienti c school of control theory,
qualitative theory of dynamical systems and their applications in science and en-
gineering. His scienti c interests focused on qualitative methods for the study of
stability and oscillations in control systems [3{5], electrical and electromechan-
ical models with cylindrical phase space [3, 6, 7], chaotic dynamics [8{10], and
stabilization of control systems [11, 12]. He supervised  ve Doctors of Science
(a habilitation degree), 16 Doctors of Philosophy (PhD), and 37 Candidates of
Science
2
. Among the recent works of the Leonov scienti c school are papers
on hidden attractors [13{22], control systems with discontinues characteris-
tics [23] and hysteresis [24], homoclinic orbits [25{28], Lyapunov exponents and
Lyapunov dimension of attractors [22, 29{32], modern phase synchronization
models used in computer architecture and global navigation systems [33{40],
time-delay feedback stabilization [41{43], Sayano{Shushenskaya power station
accident [44], the Keldysh problem of utter suppression [45, 46]. Professor

Leonov was instrumental in bringing to fruition his insightful proposal of split-
ting the study of the problems of cybernetics in two parallel tracks theoretical
cybernetics, dealing mostly with the synthesis and adaptation of new systems,
and applied cybernetics, concerned with the rigorous study of the existing sys-
tems. As a result, in 2007, in close collaboration with N.V. Kuznetsov, he
established a new Department of Applied Cybernetics of which the former be-
came the  rst academic appointee. Over the last decade, the department has
accepted annually about 20 third-year university students; the most success-
ful ones being invited for post-graduate studies and the best of the best were
selected for participation in the joint Russia-Finland program of PhD studies,
which was organized in cooperation with the Dean of the Faculty of Information
Technology, P. Neittaanm aki (University of Jyv askyl a, Finland). On the merits
of his outstanding research, Professor Leonov had secured a rightful place in the
St. Petersburg school of control theory, the eminent representatives of which
have been Corresponding Members of Russian Academy of Sciences A.I. Lurie
(1901-1980), V.A. Yakubovich (1926-2012), and V.I. Zubov (1930-2000). He
was a member of St. Petersburg regional group of the Russian National Com-
mittee of Automatic Control chaired by Academician V.G. Peshehonov. In
2011, upon the recommendation of Academician A.B. Kurzhanski, Chairman
of Russian National Committee of Automatic Control, he was elected to the
Council of International Federation of Automatic Control and served full two-
term limits (2011-2017) there.
In 1988, Professor Leonov was elected to become Dean of Mathematics
and Mechanics Faculty, a position he held continuously till the very last day
of his life. In the 1990s, during di cult years for Russian science, Professor
Leonov was instrumental in preserving rich traditions of scienti c achievements
of mathematicians, mechanical engineers, and astronomers of the Faculty. At
the same time, Professor Leonov was successful being not only the major cus-
todian of celebrated traditions of the St Petersburg University mathematics,
but also persevering his own research advancement. As Dean, he paid great
attention to the issues of mathematics education at all levels [47{50].
We with great respect, immense admiration, and profound grief celebrate
the proli c life of our never-to-be-forgotten Friend Teacher and Colleague by
acknowledging his intellect, talents, kindness, wisdom and acumen, while ex-
pressing con dence that his qualities will serve as a guiding star for anyone with
true aspirations to become a productive member of the modern society.
