Abstract. In this paper, we study a modified Hegselmann – Krause model
of opinion dynamics based on the bounded confidence principle. This model is
formulated as a discontinuous and nonlinear dynamical system. At any time
moment of the process of opinion formation, the operator of forming the next
opinionofanagentistwo-step; first, onetakestheaverageofopinionsofagents
sharing similar opinions plus his/her own; in the second step, a regularization
procedure is performed. A new regularization procedure is applied. We find
conditions under which every trajectory tends to a fixed point of the system
and study stability properties of fixed points.
Keywords: Opinion dynamics, bounded confidence principle, Hegselmann –
Krause model, convergence of trajectories, stability of fixed points
1. Introduction. Atpresent,opinionstudiesareawell-developedfieldof
research (see, for example, the monographs [18, 23] and the recent surveys [2,Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2024
26]). The main goal of opinion dynamics is to analyze evolution of public
opinion in social systems.
Various(mostlylinear)modelsofopiniondynamicshavebeenstudiedsince
1950s ([10, 11]). The linearity of a model allows one to apply more or less
standard methods of linear dynamical systems.
Oneofthefirstnonlinearmodelswassuggestedin[13,16],wherethenotion
of “bounded confidence” had been introduced. This notion formalizes the fact
that, in the course of formation of public opinion, a member of the society is
mostly influenced by individuals sharing a similar opinion.
The first opinion model based on the notion of bounded confidence, intro-
duced by Hegselmann and Krause, was later called the Hegselmann – Krause
(HK) model; this model and its generalizations have been intensively studied
by various authors, see, for example, [9, 20, 17, 5, 19, 8, 7, 14, 24, 25, 12].
Mostly, the results were based on computer simulations, and it was noted that
“rigorous analytical results are difficult to obtain [13].
To introduce the HK model, let us consider the dynamics of opinions in a
society of voters who have to choose between two options, -1 and 1. Assume
that the society is formed by N individuals (usually called “agents”), and let
v
n
k
∈ [− 1,1], k∈{1,...,N}, be the opinion of individual k at time moment n.
Fix a positive ε < 1 (the level of bounded confidence in the society) and
consider for k∈{1,...,N} the set of indices
J(v
n
k
) ={l∈{1,...,N} :|v
n
l
− v
n
k
|≤ ε}.
This is the set of indices of agents whose opinions influence agent k at time
moment n. Denote by I(v
n
k
) the cardinality of the set J(v
n
k
) (note that I(v
n
k
)>
0).
In the original HK model (see [15]), the dynamics is governed (in our nota-
tion) by the equalities
v
n+1
k
=

I(v
n
k
)
X
l∈J(v
n
k
)
v
n
l
, k∈{1,...,N},n≥ 0. (1)
In the paper [21], the following modification of the HK model had been
studied. Fix a number h > 0 and consider the dynamics governed by the
equalities

In the paper [6], it is explained that system (2) appears as an application
of the one-step Euler method to the differential equation

whichisnaturallyavariantofthe“boundedconfidence”modelwithcontinuous
time.
System (2) is the main object of study in the present paper.
Let us explain the main differences between systems (2) and (1).
First,ifJ(v
n
k
) ={k}(i.e.,agentkdoesnothaveagentswithε-closeopinions
at time n), then v
n+1
k
= v
n
k
in model (1), i.e., his/her opinion does not change.
Incontrast,v
n+1
k
̸=v
n
k
inmodel(2). Asociologicalmeaningofthisphenomenon
is explained in [21].
The second very important difference is that the dynamics of models (2)
and (1) are essentially different.
It is easily seen that since |v
n
k
| ≤ 1 in model (1), similar inequalities hold
for v
n+1
k
, i.e., formulas (1) define a dynamical system on [ − 1,1]
N
.
At the same time, this is not so for model (2); hence, one has to apply
some regularization procedure to get a properly defined dynamical system on
[− 1,1]
N
.
Two such regularization procedures have been applied in the papers [21]
and [1].
For an array V
n
= (v
n
1
,...,v
n
N
), introduce an auxiliary array W(V
n
) =
(w
n
1
,...,w
n
N
) by setting
w
n
k
=v
n
k
+
h
I(v
n
k
)
X
l∈J(v
n
k
)
v
n
l
. (3)
Clearly,|w
n
k
|≤ 1+h.
In the paper [21], a “cutting” procedure had been applied.
Set
u
n
k
=v
n
k
if|w
n
k
|≤ 1,
u
n
k
= 1 if w
n
k
> 1,
u
n
k
=− 1 if w
n
k
<− 1,
and
Φ( V
n
) = (u
n
1
,...,u
n
N
).
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2024.403 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 55Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2024
Then Φ([0 ,1]
N
)⊂ [0,1]
N
, and we get a properly defined dynamical system
on [− 1,1]
N
.
In the paper [1], a different procedure had been applied. Take a nonzero
array V
n
, define an auxiliary array W(V
n
) by formulas (3) (clearly, W(V
n
) is
also nonzero), and set
u
n
k
=
w
n
k
max
l=1,...,N
|w
n
l
|
and
Φ( V
n
) = (u
n
1
,...,u
n
N
).
Clearly, the system Φ is also a properly defined dynamical system on
[− 1,1]
N
.
In this paper, we consider one more natural regularization procedure.
For a nonzero array V
n
= (v
n
1
,...,v
n
N
) and the corresponding array W(V
n
)
given by (3), define
µ (W(V
n
)) = max(1, max
l=1,...,N
|w
n
l
|)
and set
Φ( V
n
) = (u
n
1
,...,u
n
N
), (4)
where
u
n
k
=
w
n
k
µ (W(V
n
))
.
As in the previous cases, formula (4) defines a dynamical system Φ on
[− 1,1]
N
which we study in this paper.
Oneofthemainpropertiesofsystemsmodelingopiniondynamicsisthecon-
vergence of their trajectories as time tends to infinity. For the above dynamical
systems, knownsufficientconditionsofsuchaconvergenceareessentiallydiffer-
ent. In the paper [21], this condition has the form ε≤ 1/2, while in the paper
[1] it has the form ε(N− 1)< 1.
In this paper, we show that if
ε< 1, (5)
then all the trajectories of system Φ defined by formula (4) converge as time
tends to infinity.
In addition, we show that any trajectory of Φ tends to a fixed point and
study stability properties of fixed points.
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2024.403 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 56Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2024
Everywhere in the paper, it is assumed that condition (5) is satisfied.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe basic
properties of the system and define two classes of initial points: standard and
singular. Section 3 is devoted to trajectories of singular points. In Section 4,
we show that trajectories of standard points converge; in Section 5, it is shown
that all trajectories tend to fixed points of Φ. In Sections 6, 7, we study
stability properties of fixed points. It is shown that singular fixed points are
Lyapunov unstable, the system Φ has two asymptotically stable fixed points
P
+
= (1,...,1) and P
− = (− 1,...,− 1), and, finally, that any standard fixed
point different from P
+
and P
− is Lyapunov stable but not asymptotically
stable.
2. Basic properties of the system. Denote by Ψ the set of points
V = (v
1
,...,v
N
) such that v
1
≤ v
2
≤···≤ v
N
.
Proposition 1 If V ∈ Ψ , then Φ( V)∈ Ψ .
The proof of this Proposition repeats the proof of Proposition 3.1 of [PC].
SincethesetofelementsofΦ( V)doesnotdependontheorderofthevalues

, in what follows, we only consider trajectories of points V ∈ Ψ.

Hence, the following inequalities are valid:

Definition 1 We call a point (array V
0
) standard if the inequalities
µ (W(V
k
)) > 1 hold for all k large enough. The points that do not satisfy
this condition are called singular.
In what follows, we prove that all singular points are fixed points of Φ, and
they are Lyapunov unstable. First we prove the following simple Proposition.
Proposition 3 If µ (W(V
k
0
))> 1, then µ (W(V
k
))> 1 for all k >k
0
.
Proof. We prove the Proposition using induction on k.
Base. The statement is obviously valid for k =k
0
.
Induction step. Let us show that if µ (W(V
k
)) > 1, then µ (W(V
k+1
)) > 1
as well. By definition, the first inequality means that max
t=1,...,N
|w
t
(V
k
)| > 1. As
was noted above,
w
1
(V
k
)≤ w
2
(V
k
)≤···≤ w
N
(V
k
).
Hence,either|w
1
(V
k
)| =µ (W(V
k
))or|w
N
(V
k
)| =µ (W(V
k
)). Thisimplies
that|v
k
j
| = 1 either for j = 1 or for j =N.
Consider for definiteness the second case and assume that v
k
N
= 1 (the
remaining possible cases are considered similarly).
Note that

We claim that the sum S :=
P
t∈J(v
k+1
N
)
v
k+1
t
is nonzero and has the same sign
as v
k
N
. The statement of our Proposition is a corollary of this claim since in
this case,
µ (W(V
k+1
))≥ w
N
(V
k+1
) = 1+
S
I(v
k+1
N

> 1.

To prove the claim, note that if t∈J(v
k+1
N
), then v
k+1
t
has the same sign as
v
k+1
N
since v
k+1
N
− v
k+1
t
≤ ε< 1 and v
k+1
N
= 1. In addition, the sum S is nonzero
since it contains the nonzero term v
k+1
j
. The claim is proved. □ Remark. In the proof of Proposition 3, the inequality ε < 1 has been
explicitly applied.
Corollary 2 If V
0
is a singular point, then µ (W(V
n
)) = 1 for all n.
Corollary 3 If V
0
is a standard point, then either v
n
1
=− 1 or v
n
N
= 1 for all
n large enough.
3. Trajectories of singular points. In this section, we classify all
singular points and describe their trajectories.
Proposition 4 If v
1
≤ − ε or v
N
≥ ε, then the point V = (v
1
,...,v
N
) is
standard.
Proof. Assume that, under our assumption, the equality µ (W(V
n
)) = 1 holds
foralln. Considerthecasewherev

and it follows that

(1+

Now we apply induction to show that v

for k > 1. Indeed,
if this inequality holds for some k, then v
k+1
N
≥ v
N
≥ ε and v
k+1
l
≥ 0 for any
l∈J(v
k+1
N
). Since µ (W(V

)) = 1, we can estimate v

N
as follows:
v

for all k, which contradicts the inequalities
v

N
≤ 1. The case v

≤− ε is considered similarly.
Hence, µ (W(V
n
)) > 1 for some n. Consequently, point V is standard by
Corollary 2. □ https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2024.403 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 59Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2024
Proposition 5 Ifv

is nonzero,
then the point V = (v

Proof. To get a contradiction, assume that µ (W(V

Denote by s the sum

Assuming that for n =k our claim is valid, let us prove it for n =k+1.

n which is a contradiction. It follows that µ (W(V

means (see Corollary 2) that the point V is standard. □ Remark. It is easily seen that if v

− v

N
= 0, then
(v

Proposition 6 If ε<v

) is a standard point.
Proof. To get a contradiction, assume that µ (W(V

Denote by x the value v

The base n = 0 is obvious. Assume that the induction assumptions is valid
for some n; we prove it for n+1.

satisfiestheassumptions
of Proposition 4, which means that V is a standard point. □ Thus, we can characterize all the singular points.

Φ , v

4. Converegence of trajectories of standard points. Clearly, we
have the following representaion for points of trajectories of our dynamical
system:
V
r+1
=
E +hA
r
µ (W(V
r
))
··· E +hA
0
µ (W(V
0
))
V
0
,
where{A
r
} is a sequence of stochastic N× N matrices such that the l-th row
of a matrix A
r
contains precisely I =I(v
r− 1
l
) nonzero entries and has the form
 
0,0,..,0,
1
I
,...,
1
I
,0,0,...,0
 
in which the nonzero entries a
il
have indices i∈J(v
r− 1
l
).
Denote
G
k
:=
E +hA

;

it is easily seen that G
k
is a stochastic matrix.
We can represent the vector V
r+1
in terms of these matrices as follows:
V
r+1
=
(1+h)
r
µ (W(V
0
))··· µ (W(V
r
))
G
r
G
r− 1
··· G
0
V
0
. (6)
To prove the convergence of such products for standard initial points V
0
,
we refer to the following Theorems 1 and 2.
Theorem 1 (Lorenz, [3]). Let {G
k
} be a sequence of stochastic matrices sat-
isfying the following conditions:
(a) the diagonal entries of all he matrices G
k
are positive;
(b) (G
k
)
ij
= 0 if and only if (G
k
)
ji
= 0;
(c) there exists a δ > 0 such that any nonzero entry of any matrix G
k
is
larger than δ .
Then the infinite product G
k
G
k− 1
··· G
0
converges as k→∞.
Let us show that the matrices G
k
satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 1.
• The diagonal entries of the matrices E and A
k
are positive; hence, as-
sumption (a) is satisfied;
• the matrices E and A
k
satisfy assumption (b), hence, G
k
satisfies this
assumption as a linear combination of E and A
k
.
• any nonzero entry of a matrix A
k
is not less than
1
N
; hence, any nonzero
entry of the matrix G
k
is not less than
h
(1+h)N
. Hence, G
k
satisfies condition
(c).
Thus, it follows from Theorem 1 that the product G
r
G
r− 1
··· G
0
converges.
Next, we show that this product does not converge to the zero matrix. First,
we need the following two definitions.
Definition 2 A sequence{G
t
} of n× n stochastic matrices is called balanced
if there exists a number α ∈ (0,1) such that for any matrix G in this sequence
and any subset S⊂{ 1,2,...,n}, the following inequality holds:
X
i∈S,j∈S
G
ij
≥ α · X
i∈S,j∈S
G
ji
,
where S is the complement to S in{1,...,n}.
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2024.403 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 63Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2024
Definition 3 We say that a sequence of matrices has feedback property if
there exists a number γ > 0 such that all diagonal entries of all matrices in the
sequence are not less than γ .
The feedback property is introduced in ([4], Section 4.2) for chains of ran-
dom matrices. Namely, strong feedback property, feedback property, and weak
feedback property are considered (see [4], page 37). For chains of deterministic
matrices, the strong feedback property coincides with the feedback property,
while they differ from the weak feedback property (see [4], Example 5.2, pages
38-39).
Definition 4 (see [4], Definition 4.5.) We say that a chain of random matrices
{W(k)} belongs to the class P
∗ if there exists a vector-valued random process
π (k+1) =W(k)π (k) such that π (k)>p
∗ almost surely for all k≥ 0 and some
number p
∗ > 0.
Remark. As in [4], we write π (k) > p
∗ if any component of the vector π (k)
is larger than p
∗ (see [4], page 8).
Theorem 2 (Touri, Nedi´ c, [4]). Let {G
k
} be a balanced sequence of stochastic
matrices having the feedback property. Then{G
k
} belongs to the classP
∗ .
Letuscheckthatthatthesequenceofmatrices{G
k
}satisfiestheconditions
of the above theorem.
First we show that it is balanced. It was mentioned above that if c
ij
are the
entries of a matrix G
k
, then c
ij
̸= 0 if and only if c
ji
̸= 0. In addition, if c
ij
is a
nonzero entry, then 1≥ c
ij
≥ h
N(1+h)
. It follows that for any i,j ∈{1,...,N},
the inequality c
ij
≥ h
N(1+h)
c
ji
holds.
Thus, if we fix an arbitrary set of indices S ⊂ { 1,2,...,N}, then the
following inequality is valid:
X
i∈S, j∈S
c
ij
≥ h
N(1+h)
X
i∈S, j∈S
c
ji
.
The feedback property is obvious since the diagonal entries of any of the
matrices G
k
are not less than
1
1+h
.
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2024.403 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 64Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2024
Thus, the sequence{G
k
} belongs to the classP
∗ , i.e., there exists a vector
Z
0
such that the sequence G
r
G
r− 1
··· G
0
Z
0
does not converge to zero. Hence,
the product G
r
G
r− 1
··· G
0
does not converge to the zero matrix as r→∞.
Since µ (W(V
r
))≤ 1+h, the sequence
k
r
:=
(1+h)
r
µ (W(V
0
))··· µ (W(V
r
))
is nondecreasing.
The left-hand sides of equalities (6) are bounded; the convergence of the
products G
r
G
r− 1
··· G
0
implies the convergence of the sequence k
r
.
Note that, in addition, if V
0
is a standard point, then
µ (W(V
r
))→ 1+h, r→∞. (7)
Thus, we have shown that the trajectory of any standard point converges;
below we show that it converges to a fixed point of Φ.
5. Convergence of trajectories to fixed points. As was shown above,
any singular point V is a fixed point of Φ; hence, its trajectory obviously con-
verges to V.
Let us show that the trajectory of any standard point also converges to a
fixed point.

and it follows that

□ Proposition 8 If V is a standard point, then there exists a τ ∈ N such that
J(V
τ k
) =J(V
t
k
) for any t>τ and k∈{1,...,N}.
Proof. Denote lim
n→∞
V
n
=V
∗ = (v
∗ 1
,...,v
∗ N
).
Find the maximal index k in {1,...,N} for which there exists an l ∈
{1,...,N} such that the set {t | l ̸∈ J(v
t
k
), l ∈ J(v
t+1
k
)} is infinite. If such
a pair of indices (k,l) does not exist, then the statement of our Proposition is
valid.
The condition l̸∈J(v
t
k
), l∈J(v
t+1
k
) is equivalent to the condition
|v
t
k
− v
t
l
|>ε≥| v
t+1
k
− v
t+1
l
|.
Note that l̸∈ J(V
t
k
), l∈ J(v
t+1
k
) if and only if k̸∈ J(V
t
l
), k∈ J(v
t+1
l
). Thus,
the set {t | k ̸∈ J(v
t
l
), k ∈ J(v
t+1
l
)} is infinite as well. Since we selected the
maximal such k, k >l.
Hence, if m∈{k,k+1,...,N}, then the set{t| m̸∈J(v
t
k
), m∈J(v
t+1
k
)}
is finite. Thus, if a number τ is large enough, then
J(v
τ k
)∩{k,k+1,...,N} =J(v
τ +1
k
)∩{k,k+1,...,N} =
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2024.403 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 66Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2024
=J(v
τ +2
k
)∩{k,k+1,...,N} =....
Select an arbitrary t > τ in the set {t | l ̸∈ J(v
t
k
), l ∈ J(v
t+1
k
)}. The sets
J(v
t
k
) and J(v
t+1
k
) consist of consecutive indices, J(v
t
k
)∩{k,k + 1,...,N} =
J(v
t+1
k
)∩{k,k+1,...,N}, and l̸∈ J(v
t
k
), l∈ J(v
t+1
k
) for some l < k. Hence,
J(v
t
k
) ={l
2
,...,r} andJ(v
t+1
k
) ={l
1
,...,r} for somel
1
,l
2
,r∈{1,...,N} such
that l
1
≤ l <l
2
≤ k≤ r.
According to our notation,
S(v

) =
v

and
S(v

) =
v

+··· +v
t+1

.
Due to the corresponding convergencies, we may assume that τ is so large
that |v
t
m
− v
∗ m
| < ε/(12N) and |S(v
t
m
)− v
∗ m
| < ε/(12N) for all t ≥ τ and
m = 1,...,N. In particular,
|v

|≤| v

Theorem 3 Trajectory of any standard point tends to a standard fixed point.
Proof. Let lim
n→∞
V
n
= V
∗ = (v
∗ 1
,...,v
∗ N
). Without loss of generality, we may
assume that v
∗ 1
= − 1 (see Corollary 3). By the previous Proposition, for a
fixed k∈{1,...,N}, the sets J(v
t
k
) coincide starting from some t. For brevity,
denote J
k
= J(v
t
k
) = J(v
t+1
k
) = ..., and the cardinality of this set will be
denoted by I
k
.
Let us show that if indices k,l ∈ {1,...,N} satisfy the inequality v
l
∈
[v
∗ k
,v
∗ k
+ε], then v
∗ k
=v
∗ l
. We prove this using induction on k.
Base. k = 1. By Proposition 7, lim

I

P

S(v

to the limit, we conclude that
P

v

I

=− 1.
Since v
∗ j
≥− 1 for all j ∈ J
1
and the arithmetic mean of these numbers equals
-1, v
∗ j
=− 1 for all j∈J
1
.
The equalities v

that P

This proves the induction base.
Induction step. Assume that our statement is proved for k and prove
it for k + 1. If v
∗ k+1
= v
∗ k
, then the statement is obviously true. Otherwise,
v
∗ k+1
>v
∗ k
+ε and k̸∈J
k+1
.
By Proposition 7, lim

S(v

. Passing to the
limit, we get the equality
P
j∈J
k+1
v
∗ j
I
k+1
=v
∗ k+1
.
The arithmetic mean of numbers in the set J
k+1
equals v
∗ k+1
, and v
∗ j
≥ v
∗ k+1
for
all j∈J
k+1
since k̸∈J
k+1
. Hence, v
∗ j
=v
∗ k+1
for all j∈J
k+1
.
Since v
∗ q
=v
∗ k+1
for all q∈J
k+1
, a similar reasoning shows that
P
j∈J
q
v
∗ j
I
q
=v
∗ k+1
and v
∗ j
= v
∗ k+1
for all j ∈ J
q
. In particular, this means J
q
= J
k+1
= {s ∈
{1,...,N} | v
∗ s
= v
∗ k+1
} for any q ∈ J
k+1
. Further we assume that q is the
largest index in J
k+1
.
Since q +1 ̸∈ J
q
, there exists a large enough τ ∈ N and a number α > 0
such that|v
τ q
− v
τ q+1
|>ε+α . By Corollary 1,|v
t
q
− v
t
q+1
|>ε+α for all t>τ .
Thus, |v
∗ q
− v
∗ q+1
|≥ ε+α > ε . Since v
∗ q
= v
∗ k+1
, v
∗ k+1
+ε < v
∗ q+1
≤···≤ v
∗ N
,
which completes the induction step.
Thus, for any indices i,j ∈ {1,...,N} either v
∗ i
= v
∗ j
or |v
∗ i
− v
∗ j
| > ε.
This precisely means that S(v

for any k ∈ {1,...,N} and w
k
(V
∗ ) =
v
∗ k
+hS(v

) = (1+h)v
∗ k
. It is easily seen that µ (W(V

(V

Hence,
w

µ (W(V

which means that V

Corollary 5 V = (v

) is a standard fixed point if and only if for any
pair of indices i,j∈{1,...,N} either v

∗ j
or|v

∗ j

suppose V is a standard fixed point, V
∗ = V. Hence, for any pair of indices

or|v

Proposition 9 Singular fixed points are Lyapunov unstable.
Proof. IfV = (v
1
,...,v
N
) is a singular fixed point, then |v

− v

|≤ ε andv
1
+
··· +v
N
= 0. Fix a small δ > 0 and consider the point U = (v
1
+δ,v
2
,...,v
N
).
Since v
1
+··· + v
N
+ δ > 0, the point U is standard. The trajectory
of the point U converges to a fixed point P = (p
1
,...,p
N
), and µ (W(P)) =
lim
k→∞
µ (W(V
k
)) = 1+h. This means that P is a standard point. By Corollary
3, p
1
=− 1 or p
n
= 1. It follows from the classification of singular points (see
Corollary 4) that− ε≤ v
1
≤···≤ v
n
<ε. Since δ is arbitrary, this means that
the fixed point V is unstable. □ Before classifying the standard points’ stability, let us introduce one more
object (see [1]).
Definition 6 We call a subset{k,...,m}⊂{ 1,...,N}, where k≤ m, a band
for a pointU = (u
1
,...,u
N
) if|u

(if k > 0), and |u

m+1
| > ε (if m < N). The value |u
m
− u
k
| is called the
width of the band{k,...,m}.
Proposition 10 Standard fixed points are Lyapunov stable.
Proof. Consider a standard fixed point V = (v
1
,...,v
N
) and an arbitrary
ε
0

= 1.
Find a positive δ <ε

|u

|u

Corollary 5.
Take an arbitrary point U

such that|u

definition, the set of indices {1,...,N} can be represented as a disjoint union

Hence, for any integer n ≥ 0 and any index i ∈ {k,...,m}, the inclusion

Hence, if δ <ε/ (8N), then{k,...,m} is a band for all U

does not exceed 3δ at any time moment. Consequently, J(u

for any integer n ≥ 0 and any index i ∈ {k,...,m}. Denote T

As was said above, the set {1,...,N} decomposes into a disjoint union of

In addition, we have shown that for any time moment n and for any index
i belonging to any band, the inequality |u

that the point V is Lyapunov stable. □ 7. Asymptotic stability.
Proposition 11 The points P

asymptotically stable.
Proof. The proof of this fact is based on the same idea as the proof of item 1

Let us prove the statement for the point P

A similar reasoning can be applied in the case of the point P

totically stable.
Proof. The proof of this fact is based on the same idea as the proof of item 2

Assumethatthereexistsanasymptoticallystablestandardfixedpoint U =

= − 1. Note that in this
case u

̸=− 1 (since U and P

For the point U, there exists a decomposition of {1,...,N} into bands,
and, as shown above, 1 and N belong to different bands. Consider the band
