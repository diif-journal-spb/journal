Abstract.
Frequency domain conditions for the existence of ﬁnite-dimensional projec-
tors and determining observations for attractors of semi-dynamical systems in
Hilbert spaces are derived. Evolutionary variational equations are considered
as control systems in a rigged Hilbert space structure. As an example we in-
vestigate a coupled system of Maxwell’s equations and the heat equation in
one-space dimension. We show the controllability of the linear part and the
frequency domain conditions for this example.

1 Introduction
We investigate a class of evolutionary variational equations in general Hilbert
spaces. The variational equations are considered as general control or feedback
systemsconsistingof alinearpartanda nonlinearpart. Apowerfulmethodfor
the qualitativeinvestigationof such systems is the frequency theorem for equa-
tions of evolutionary type ([4, 14, 16]). Using some properties of the transfer
operator of the linear part of the given control system, the frequency theorem
gives suﬃcient conditions for the existence of Lyapunov functionals for dissi-
pativity, global stability and instability of nonlinear systems ([15, 17]). In this
paper we extend the frequency domain approach to the investigation of global
attractors generated by variational equations.
The article is divided as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the rigged Hilbert
space structure which is used for variational systems. General monotonicity
conditions for the existence of global solutions to evolutionaryproblems are in-
troduced. ThefrequencydomainmethodisdescribedinSect.3. Wedeﬁnehere
the transfer operator for the linear part of the system and quadratic forms for
thecharacterizationofthelinearpartoftheequation. Ageneraltheoremforthe
existenceofquadraticLyapunovfunctionalsisproved. InSect.4suchquadratic
Lyapunovfunctionalsareusedfortheconstructionofbijectivecontinuousmaps
from an attractor onto a ﬁnite-dimensional projection. The realization of this
approachforsystems in ﬁnite-dimensionalspaces is shown in Sect.5. In Sect.6
we derive frequency domain conditions for a class of evolutionary equations.
In Sect. 7 we consider a coupled system of Maxwell’s equations and the heat
equation ([9, 10, 11, 18]). We give a characterizationof this microwave heating
problem as control system in certain Hilbert spaces. The controllability of the
linearpart of the system is shown and a frequency domainconditionis veriﬁed.
The nonlinearities of the heating problem are described by quadratic forms.

0
. Suppose that this system has
a global B-attractor A ([2, 22]). One way to show the existence of such an
attractor is to use a frequency-domain theorem for the compact dissipativity
of the semi-dynamical system. From the property of compact dissipativity it is
easy to derive the existence of a globalB-attractorA ([22]). Our aim is to use
the properties of Theorem 1 for the construction of a homeomorphic map from
this attractor onto a subset of the ﬁnite-dimensional space. Note that we do
not use any information about the fractal dimension ofA.

parameter λ > 0 and with respect to the decomposition Y

Remark 1. The construction of a homeomorphism Π : A → ΠA is closely
related to the existence of a ﬁnite number of determining modes. Let us recall
the following deﬁnition which goes back to O. Ladyzhenskaya ([7, 13, 20]).
Suppose that the variational system (4) generates a semigroup {ϕ
t
}
t≥0
in the
phase space Y
0
. Suppose also that this semigroup has an attractor A and a
ﬁnite dimensional projector Π with the following property: For any two orbits
γ
1
,γ
2
on the attractorA the condition Πγ
1
= Πγ
2
implies thatγ
1
=γ
2
. In this
casewesaythatthenumberofdeterminingmodesof{ϕ
t
}
t≥0
isﬁnite. Itfollows
that under the conditions of Theorem 2 the number of determining modes is
ﬁnite. The properties of the quadratic formV(y) from the proof of Theorem 2
are related to the cone condition ([8, 21]).
In the next section we consider some questions connected with determining
functionals.

globalB-attractor of the semi-group. Our aim is to construct a homeomorphic
map
Π : A → ΠA ⊂ R

. (The more general case Π : A → ΠA ⊂ R

,k =
2,3,...,n−1, can be described similarly.)

and 1×n, respectively, such that (A+λI,B) is stabilizable, and A+λI has
2 eigenvalues with positive real part and n−2 eigenvalues with negative real
part.

6 Determining observations for variational equations
Suppose that F and G are quadratic forms on Y

×Ξ. The class N(F,G) of
nonlinearities for (4) consists of all maps ϕ such that the following conditions

are satisﬁed:
For any T > 0 and any two functions y(·) ∈ L

) and ξ(·) ∈
L

(0,T;Ξ) with
ξ(t) =ϕ(Cy(t)), a. a.t∈ [0,T] (28)
it follows that
F(y(t),ξ(t))≥ 0, a. a.t∈ [0,T] (29)
and there exists a continuous function Φ :Y

numbersλ> 0 and γ > 0 such that

Suppose that S is an other Hilbert space which we call observation space.
Any bounded linear operatorM :Y

Assume that P ∈ L(Y

For an equivalent deﬁnition of an observation determining for dissipativity
of a variational inequality, see ([9]).
In order to state a frequency-domain theorem for the existence of an ob-
servation determining for dissipativity we need the following frequency-domain
condition.
(F5) There exists numbers λ> 0 and μ> 0 such that the following three
properties hold:
a) Any solution of ˙ y = (A+λI)y, y(0) =y

Theorem 3. Suppose that there are numbers λ > 0 and μ > 0 such that the
assumptions (F1)-(F3), (F5) are satisﬁed for the variational equation (4) with
nonlinearity φ∈ N(F,G). Then the observation given by (32) is determining
for the dissipativity of the variational equation (4).
Proof. Fromtheassumptions(F1)-(F3),(F5)itfollows([16])thatthereexists

From (34) and assumption (F5) it follows ([5]) that (y,Py)

For an arbitrary solution y(·) of (4) and ξ(t) =φ(Cy(t)) we get from (34) the
inequality

.
The original initial-boundary problem (40) – (45) can be written as
˙ y =Ay+Bξ, y(0)=y

. (46)
Let us show that the pair (A,B) is L

For this we show that the spectrum of A lies in the left-hand side of the
complex plane.
Consider for this the eigenvalue problem

Thus we have shown that the spectrum of A lies on the left-hand side of
