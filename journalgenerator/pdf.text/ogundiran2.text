Abstract
We establish the existence of solution of Stochastic impulsive differential inclusion in
in nite dimensional space. We employed  xed point theorem for multivalued map to
obtain the solution.
AMS Subject Classi cation: 34K50, 34A60 Key Words and Phrases: stochastic
differential inclusions, mild solution, impulsive effects.
1 Introduction
Impulsive differential equations model problem with impulsive effects which are
due to instantaneous perturbations at certain moments. The vast applications
of the theory of impulsive differential equations and inclusions have attracted
many authors both to deterministic and stochastic cases. The theory of impul-
sive differential equations and inclusions were extensively studied in [3] , [8] and
the references cited there. Existence of solution for integrodifferential inclusion
in in nite dimensional space without impulse effects was established in [4]. This
work is concerned with stochastic systems in in nite dimensional space. In [13],
concise study of stochastic differential equation in in nite dimensional space was
done and this will form a bedrock of this work. By Banach  xed point theo-
rem and semigroup approach, the existence of solution of nonlinear stochastic
differential inclusions was established in [1]. Stochastic systems with impulses
effects were studied in [12] with non local condition while neutral stochastic
evolution inclusions were studied in [11] both for convex and non convex cases.Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2014
The existence of weak solution of stochastic differential inclusions has applica-
tions in stochastic control and partial differential inclusions as established in
[7]and references cited in it. The mild solution of Stochastic evolution inclu-
sions with impulsive effects considered in this work has applications to transition
semigroup and hence the Feller property of such semigroup.
The result in this work has applications in the study of control problem for a
stochastic dynamical system. The solution sets will be employed in the space
of admissible controls for the system and the impulsive effects due to the effects
of abrupt interruption of the system over certain period of time. The work also
have practical applications in the study of models of interacting species in a
random medium in which the impulsive effects are due to some environmental
factors over a period of time.
In the sequel, preliminaries necessary for the result shall be stated in section 2
and the main result will be proved in section 3.

Let H be a real separable Hilbert space with inner producth:;:i and norm
k :k and let K be another real separable Hilbert space with inner product
h:;:i
K
and normk:k
K
. L(K;H) denotes the space of bounded operators from
K to H. Let (
;F;F
t

fF

g satisfying the usual condition (i.e. the  ltration contains all P -null sets
and is right continuous). w(t) denotes a given K-valued Brownian motion

We shall state some de nitions and properties of multivalued maps which will
be employed in the sequel.
For a nonempty set X, let (X;d) be a metric space and P (X) denote the
nonempty family of subsets of X, we shall denote by P
cl
(X) (resp. P
b;cp;cv
(X))
the nonempty family of closed (resp.bounded, compact and convex)subsets of
X.
A multivalued map F : X ! P (X) is closed (resp. convex)-valued if F (x)
is closed (resp. convex) for all x2 X. F is said to be bounded if for every
bounded set V2P (X), F (V ) is bounded in X.
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 56Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2014
F is said to be upper semicontinuous (u.s.c) at a point point x2X if x2X,
F (x) is a nonempty closed subset ofX and for each open setV ofX containing
F (x) there exists an open neighbourhood N of x such that F (N)  V . F is
said to be u.s.c on a nonempty subsetY ofX ifF is u.s.c at every pointy2Y .
If for every bounded subset V of X, F (V ) is relatively compact then F is said
to be completely continuous. If F is continuous with nonempty compact values,
then F is u.s.c if and only if F has closed graph (i.e. x
n
! x, y
n
! y implies
y2F (x)).
Let J R be nonempty, a multivalued map F : J! P
bd;cl;cv
(X) is said to be
measurable if for each x2X the distance function Y :J!R de ned by
Y (t) =d
 
(x;F (t)) = inffd(x;z) :z2F (t)g
is measurable. All these properties of multivalued maps can be found in [2], [5]
and other standard books on set-valued analysis or differential inclusions.
We shall be concerned with the existence of mild solution of the stochastic
differential inclusions with impulsive effects:

Our main result is based on the following Bohnenblust-Karlin (Corollary 9.8,
[15] ) Theorem.
Lemma 3.1 Let X be a Banach space and K be a closed and convex subset of
X. Suppose the multivalued map 	 : K! P
cl;cv
(X) is upper semicontinuous
and the set 	(K) is relatively compact in X: Then 	 has a  xed point in K:
We shall employ the following Lasota-Opial result [9].
Lemma 3.2 Let I be a compact interval and X be a Hilbert space. Let G be a
L
2
-Caratheodory multivalued map with Q
G;x
6=; and   be a linear continuous
mapping from L
2
(I;X) to C(I;X): Then the operator
  Q
G
:C(I;X)!P
b;cl;cv
(C(I;X)); x! (  Q
G
)(x) = (Q
G
)(x)
is a closed graph operator in C(I;X) C(I;X):
We now state and the prove the existence result.
Theorem 3.1 Assume that conditions H

We de ne the transition semigroup corresponding to this mild solution as fol-

Let B

k
Then P

has a semigroup property, i.e. for all  2 H, and
s;t2 [0;T ], s;t6=t
k
with s +t2 [0;T ], (s +t)6=t
k
.
Under appropriate assumptions, the function P
t
' is globally Lipschitz in H,
which means that the semigroup is strong Feller [6] .
