Abstract
The paper presents the minimization of functional issue, associated to the
 nite elements method (FEM) and establish on detail the equations to solve the
problem of the three-dimensional (3D) magnetic  eld, in inhomogeneous, non-
linear and anisotropic domains with random main directions of magnetization.
Numerical computation of the algebraic equations system obtained, it could be
established the state quantities of the magnetic  eld or other quantities which
are interested in.
Key words: permanent magnets, FEM, inhomogenity, nonlinearity, anisotropy.Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2002
4. The minimization of the energy functional
On FEM, the functional must be minimized to get the equations system
which follow to solve the  eld problem. If the  nite elements of 3D discretization
mesh are small enough, the relation (33) from [1] become

The last two sums of expression (34) may be not
detailed in a general treatment, because the boundary
conditions for the possible concrete cases are different.
In practice we can also have cases when the Neumann conditions are equal
to zero what correspond to canceling of the last two sums. With the object
of continuing the general analysis of the minimization process of functional,
we will detail only the  rst two sums of relation (34), following to take into
account, for concrete cases, the terms corresponding to the Neumann boundary
conditions too. With these mentions, taking into account the relations (37, 38,
39), the functional (34) become

5. The establish of FEM equations
For every node of the discretization mesh, it must be known the coordinates
(x; y; z), the adjacent  nite elements and the neighboring nodes. In order to
establish the rules for writing the equations system, two local numbering are
introduced: N
vi
is the number of the neighbor nodes to the node i; M
ai
is the
number of adjacent elements to the node i. The concrete values for N
vi
and
M
ai
depends on the position of every node i = 1; n in the discretization mesh.
For instance, for any node i from inside of the tetrahedral mesh, N
vi
= 12 and
M
ai
= 20 [3]. The magnetic scalar potential V
Hi
of the node i appears only
in elementary functionless F
0
 
, F
00
 
and F
00
p 
which belong to the tetrahedral
adjacent to the node i. Thus, the equation from the system (42) concerning to
any node i from inside of the discretization mesh, which has M

  a adjacent
elements, will be

We notice that for specify equation i of the system (42), the term having the
form (50) represents the free terms of the equation, because it doesn't contain
the magnetic scalar potentials of the nodes (the unknowns of the problem).
After the introduction of the terms (48, 49, 50) in relation (43), results the
general form of an equation from the system (42), written for any node i from

) ( s.[1]), as the  nite element t { adjacent to the node i for which is
written the relation (51) { is situated in the ferromagnetic material zone, in air
{ gap or in permanent magnet. The current index t from the expressions (52,
53, 54) refers to the  nite element   = t, which could particularized for all the
nodes i = 1; n of the discretization mesh, identifying the elements (1  M
ai
)
from around of each node. The quantity w from the relation (53) represent
the number of  nite element (of the M
ai
adjacent to the node i) to which any
neighbor node (of the N
vi
neighbor to the node i) is adjacent. For the analyzed
case (i { an inner node) w = 5 [3]. The coe cients c
rs
from the relations (52,
53, 54) are obtained by identifying the nodes j; k and ` of each  nite element
around the common node i for what the relation (51) is written. Therefore,
for each node i with unknown magnetic scalar potential an equation having
the form (51) could be written. In relation with the concrete position of each
node i, the number of the neighbor nodes N
vi
, respectively of the adjacent
elements M
ai
of the node i, gets particularly values. For the nodes on the
boundary surface with non-null Neumann conditions of the studied domain, in
equation (43) we introduce supplementary particular terms correspond to these
conditions (the last two sums from energetic functional (34)).
6. Conclusions
If we write the equation (51) for all the nodes i = 1; n with unknowns mag-
netic scalar potentials of the 3D discretization mesh in which the  eld problem
is analyzed, a compatible system of algebraic equations is obtained. The val-
ues of the magnetic scalar potentials are gotten by numerical computation of

the system. After that, we can get (s.eq. 37, 38, 39) the components of the
magnetic  eld intensity for each  nite element   = 1; m:

The components of the magnetic ux density
 
B
 
are determined from
 
H
 
and the tensors of magnetic permeability, in the following way: in air-gap
 
B
 
=  
0
 
H
 
; in ferromagnetic materials
 
B
 
=
 
   
 
 
H
 
; in permanent magnets
 
B
 
=
 
   
p 
 
H
 
.
In conclusion, by numerical computation of equation system (51), we get
 
H
 
and
 
B
 
(  = 1; m) in each  nite element of the studied domain which is
3D, inhomogeneous, nonlinear and anisotrop. After we know
 
H
 
and
 
B
 
, we
can determine other quantities which we are interested in, such as: magnetic
voltage, magnetic ux through certain surfaces, forces (torque) applied on coils
or electric conductors placed within the air-gap and so on.
