Abstract. This paper is a survey of some recent results giving su cient con-
ditions of shadowing for dynamical systems in the absence of hyperbolicity.
The main topics of the survey are as follows: method of pairs of Lyapunov type
functions, shadowing in a neighborhood of a nonisolated  xed point, conditional
multiscale shadowing for sequences of mappings of a Banach space, conditional
shadowing for dynamical systems on so-called simple time scales. The paper
contains a new result on conditional multiscale shadowing in the case of an
in nite family of projections of the phase space.
Keywords: Dynamical system, pseudotrajectory, shadowing, hyperbolicity
1 Introduction
The theory of shadowing of approximate trajectories (pseudotrajectories) is
now an intensively developing branch of the global theory of dynamical systems.
One can  nd basic information concerning shadowing in the monographs [1-3];
the survey [4] is devoted to some recent results of the theory.
The main property of dynamical systems studied by the shadowing theory
can be stated as follows. Consider a homeomorphism f of a metric space
(X; dist). Let d > 0. A sequencefy
n
2 Xg is called a d-pseudotrajectory
of f if the inequalities
dist(f(y
n
);y
n+1
)<d (1)Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
hold.
One says that f has the (standard) shadowing property if for any " > 0
there is ad> 0 such that for any d-pseudotrajectoryfy
n
g off there is a point
x2X for which
dist(f
n
(x);y
n
)<":
In this case, we say that the exact trajectoryff
n
(x)g -shadows the pseudo-
trajectoryfy
n
g.
The  rst su cient conditions under which a dynamical system has the shad-
owing property were obtained by D.V. Anosov [5] and R. Bowen [6]. Applying
principally different approaches, they showed that, for a diffeomorphism, shad-
owing is a corollary of hyperbolicity (and, as easilly seen from the proofs in [5]
and [6], in a neighborhood of a hyperbolic set, a diffeomorphism has the Lip-
schitz shadowing property, i.e., there exists a constant L such that, for small
enough d, any d-pseudotrajectory is Ld-shadowed by an exact trajectory).
At present, relations between shadowing and hyperbolicity are well studied
(see the book [3] for details).
In the present paper, we give a survey of some recent results giving su -
cient conditions of shadowing in the absence of hyperbolicity. This survey is
motivated by the talk given by the author at the Joint PDMI { MIRAN Session
\Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems" (St. Petersburg, May 12 { 14,
2023).
The paper also contains a new result { we generalize the main theorem
of the author's paper [7] to the case of an in nite family of projections (see
Section 4 below). This generalization is not straightforward; in fact, we have
to work with different Banach spaces etc.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe the
method of pairs of Lyapunov type functions developed by A.A. Petrov and
the author in the paper [8]. This method is applied to a perturbation of the
hyperbolic automorphism of the 2-torus studied by J. Lewowicz in [9]. It is
noted that, using the described method, one can obtain su cient conditions of
shadowing for nonsmooth systems.
In Section 3, it is shown that the method described in Section 2 can be
applied to study shadowing in a neighborhood of a  xed point belonging to a
\critical" manifold consisting of  xed points. In this case, not every pseudotra-
jectory in such a neighborhood can be shadowed, but it is possible to shadow
pseudotrajectories for which \one step errors" are small enough compared to

the distances of points of the pseudotrajectory to the critical manifold.
In Section 4, we study conditional shadowing for sequences of mappings of
a Banach spaceX. It is assumed that there exists a countable family of projec-
tions that commute with linear terms of the considered mappings. Conditions
of shadowing are obtained in terms of the norms of projections of one step er-
rors of pseudotrajectories and of estimates of Lipschitz constants of projections
of the \small nonlinear" terms. As mentioned above, the main theorem of this
section generalizes the result of the author's paper [7] in which the case of a
 nite family of projections has been studied.
Finally, in Section 5, we describe conditions of conditional shadowing for
dynamical systems on so-called simple time scales consisting of a family of iso-
lated segments of the positive ray of ; these results are obtained in the author's
paper [10].
2 Method of a pair of Lyapunov type functions
Let f be a homeomorphism of a compact metric space (X; ).
We assume that there exist two continuous nonnegative functionsV andW
de ned in a closed neighborhood of the diagonal of X X such that
V (p;p) =W (p;p) = 0 for any p2X
and conditions (C1)-(C9) below are satis ed. In what follows, arguments of the
functions V and W are assumed to be close enough, so that the functions are
de ned.
Our conditions are formulated not directly in terms of the functions V and
W but in terms of some geometric objects de ned via these functions. Our
main reasoning for the choice of these form of conditions is as follows.
(1) Precisely these conditions are used in the proofs.
(2) It is relatively easy to check conditions of that kind for particular func-
tions V and W .
Let us introduce the main objects which we work with.
Fix positive numbers a and b and a point p2X. Set
P (a;b;p) =fq2X : V (q;p) a;W (q;p) bg;
Q(a;b;p) =fq2P (a;b;p) : V (q;p) =ag;
T (a;b;p) =fq2P (a;b;p) : V (q;p) = 0g:

introduced above.

Theorem 1 [8]. Under conditions (C1)-(C9), f has the  nite shadowing
property (and hence, the standard shadowing property ) on the space X.

Let us give an example of application of Theorem 1 to a diffeomorphism
with nonhyperbolic behavior.
Example 1. Consider a diffeomorphism studied by Lewowicz in [9]. This
diffeomorphism is a perturbation of a hyperbolic automorphism of the 2-torus
T
2
.
Fix numbers 0<ff< 1<  and a small r > 0 and de ne a map F :
2
!
2
by
F (x;y) = (ffx + (x) (y); y);
where
 (x) =
Z
x
0
((1 ff) h(s))ds;
h :! is a C
1
function such that h(0) = 0, 0  h(x) < 1, and  (x) = 0 for
jxj r, and   :! is a C
1
function such that  (0) = 1,  (y) = ( y),   is not
increasing for y  0, and  (y) = 0 forjyj r.
LetA be an integer hyperbolic 2 2 matrix with detA = 1. If 0<ff< 1< 
are the eigenvalues ofA andu
1
andu
2
are the corresponding eigenvectors, then
A(x;y) = (ffx; y)
in coordinates whose axes are parallel to u
1
and u
2
.
The lattice   with vertices
f(n + 1=2)u
1
; (m + 1=2)u
2
: m;n2g
is invariant with respect to the action of the map v7!Av. Let  :
2
!
2
=  be
the corresponding projection of the plane to the 2-torus.
De ne f : T
2
! T
2
by f( ( ; )) =   F (x;y) (of course, we extend F
periodically with repect to the above-mentioned lattice).
It is shown in [9] that if r is small enough, then f is an expansive diffeo-
morphism of the 2-torus (see the de nition below).
Note that the de ned diffeomorphism f is not structurally stable since the
eigenvalues of Df at the zero  xed point are 1 and  .
At the same time, it is shown in [8] that conditions (C1)-(C9) are satis ed
for functions V and W de ned as follows: If p = (p
x
;p
y
) and q = (q
x
;q
y
), then
V (p;q) =jp
y
 q
y
j andW (p;q) =jp
x
 q
x
j (such functions are properly de ned
if p and q are close enough). Hence, Theorem 1 is applicable to f, and f has
the shadowing property.

Let us relate the obtained result to two classical properties of dynamical
systems, namely, to topological stability and expansivity.
Recall the standard de nitions.
Denote by H(X) the space of homeomorphisms of a compact metric space
(X; ) endowed with the metric
 (f;g) = max
p2X
max((f(p);g(p)); (f
 1
(p);g
 1
(p))):
A homeomorphismf is called topologically stable if for any> 0 there exists a
neighborhoodY off inH(X) such that ifg2Y , then there exists a continuous
map h : X!X such that f h =h g and
(h(p);p)<; p2X:
A homeomorphism f is called expansive if there exists a positive ff such
that if
(f
k
(p);f
k
(q)) ff; k2;
then p =q.
Walters in [11] proved that if a homeomorphismf is expansive and has the
shadowing property, then f is topologically stable.
Thus, we can apply Theorem 1 to establish the topological stability of the
diffeomorphism f in Example 1.
In his proof of topological stability of f, Lewowicz reduced the problem to
the study of suspension ows, which does not seem natural.
In its turn, Theorem 1 can be applied to nonsmooth homeomorphisms, for
example, to perturbations f of a hyperbolic automorphism of the 2-torus T
2
corresponding to the map
F (x;y) = ( 
1
(x); 
2
(y));
where 
1
and 
2
are increasing continuous functions for which there exist num-
bers r; 2 (0; 1) such that
(1)j 
1
(x + )  
1
(x)j  j j and  
 1
j j j 
2
(y + )  
2
(y)j forj j<r;
(2)  
1
(x) =ffx; jxj r;
(3)  
2
(y) = y; jyj r.
In this case, one can apply the same Lyapunov type functions V andW as
in Example 1.

3 Shadowing near a nonisolated  xed point
The method of Lyapunov type functions can be applied in the case of non-
isolated  xed points. Of course, if a  xed pointp of a homeomorphismf belongs
to a submanifold M consisting of  xed points (as in the case studied below),
thenf does not have the standard shadowing property in any neighborhood of
p. Nevertheless, sometimes it is possible to establish a \conditional" shadowing
property for pseudotrajectoriesfx
k
g whose points do not belong toM assuming
that the size of \one step errors"
(x
k+1
;f(x
k
))
is small compared to the distances from the points x
k
to the manifold M.
Such an approach (in the case of a nontransverse homoclinic point) had been
suggested by S. Tikhomirov.
Let us restrict our consideration to a simple (but nontrivial) example of the
2-dimensional diffeomorphism
f(x;y) =
 
x
2
;y(1 +x
2
)
 
: (2)
The origin is a nonisolated  xed point of f (every point of the line M =
f(0;y) : y2g is a  xed point).
Represent p2
2
in the form p = (p
x
;p
y
) and consider a  nite pseudotrajec-
tory p
0
;:::;p
n
of f such that (p

jf(p

x
; k = 0;:::;n  1; (3)
for some d> 0. Set
K

=f(x;y) : 0<jxj< 1g:
In [12], the following result is proved.
Theorem 2. There exists a neighborhood K of the origin and a number
c > 0 such that, for any > 0 and for any pseudotrajectory p

;:::;p
n
of f in
K\K

that satis es conditions (??) withd =c, there exists a pointp satisfying
the inequalities
jf
k

In the proof of this result, the method of the previous section is applied;
the corresponding Lyapunov type functions are
V (q;p) =jp

Analyzing the proof, one can see that the method is applicable not only to
diffeomorphism (??) but in more general situations as well.
4 Multiscale conditional shadowing
Let X be a Banach space with normj:j. Consider a sequence f
n
; n  0; of
mappings of the space X having the form
f
n
(x) =A
n
x +g
n
(x); (4)
where A
n
are linear mappings.
A sequence x
n
2X; n  0; is called a trajectory of (??) if
x
n+1
=f
n
(x
n
); n  0:
Let n m  0; set
 (n;n) = Id
and
 (n;m) =A
n 1
   A
m
if n>m:
We  x a family of projectionsP
k;n
of the spaceX, wherek2K andn  0;
here K is a countable index set having the form K =KS[KU.
It is assumed that the projections P
k;n
have the following properties:
P
i;n
P
j;n
= 0 if i6=j;

P
k;n
= Id for n  0;
and
A

Of course, property (??) implies that
 (n;m)P
k;m
=P
k;n
 (n;m) for k2K and n m: (6)
Let k2K and n  0; denote by X
k;n
the image P
k;n
X.
We assume, in addition, that the restrictions of A
n
to X
k;n
are invertible
for k2KU; this allows us to de ne for k2KU the operators

acting from X

Formally, we have to write 	
k

short form will lead to no misunderstanding.
Of course, an analog of property (??) is valid; if k2KU and n<m, then
	(n;m)P
k;m
=P
k;n
	(n;m):
We make the following
Main assumption. There exists a number M > 0 and two sequences of
positive numbers ff

with the following properties.

Example 2. To avoid unnecessary complications, we give an example of

Let k = 1; thenk (n;n)P

may take the constant sequence ff

After that, we can similarly select the sequences

5 Perturbations of dynamical systems on simple time scales
Let us consider a simple variant of a time scaleT that is a subset of [0;1)
and consists of isolated segments T

, where n = 1; 2;::: , T

= [l

The phase space is a Banach space X with normj j. We denote byk k
the operator norm of a linear operator.

The system on T
n
is generated by a differential equation
_ x =A
n
(t)x +a
n
(t;x); t2T
n
: (18)
We assume that the operators A
n
(t) are continuous and bounded on T
n
. The
functions a
n
(t;x) are assumed to be continuous and Lipschitz continuous in x
on T
n
 X (with small Lipschitz constants).
Denote by 
n
(t;t
0
;x
0
) the solution of the Cauchy problem (t
0
;x
0
) for system
(??).
Thus, for anyt

n
and for anyx
0
2X there exists a solution 
n
(t;t
0

)
de ned on the whole segmentT
n
(in what follows, we work with such solutions).
Let  
n
(t) and 	
n
(t) be the fundamental matrices of the system
_ x =A
n
(t)x
such that  
n
(l
n
) = E and 	
n
(r
n
) = E, respectively, where E is the identity
map of X.
For any indexn = 1; 2;::: we  x a map ofX taking a pointx toB
n
x+b
n
(x),
where B
n
is a linear operator and b
n
(x) is a continuous function (it is not
assumed, in general, that any operator B
n
is an isomorphism of the space X).
The trajectory x(t), t2T , of the appearing system starting at a point
x
0
2X at the time moment l
1
(the left-hand end of the segment T
1
) is de ned
as follows:
  x(t) =

(t;l

  x(l

(x(r

We  x countable sets of indices KS and KU and assume that there exist
families of continuous projections P

Perturbations. The natural statement of the perturbation problem is as
follows.
We replace systems (??) on the segments T
n
by systems
_ x =C
n
(t)x +c
n
(t;x)
(assuming that the operators C
n
(t) and the functions c
n
(t;x) have properties
similar to those of A
n
(t) and a
n
(t;x)) and the maps B
n
x +b
n
(x) by similar
mapsD
n
x +d
n
(x), take a trajectory (t) of the new system and look for a close
trajectory x(t) of the original system.
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.301 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 17Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
As usual, we are looking for functionsv(t) onT
n
with values inX such that
x(t) = (t) +v(t); t2T
n
:
From the relations
_ x =A
n
(t)x+a
n
(t;x) =A
n
(t)(  +v)+a
n
(t;  +v) =
_
  + _ v =C
n
(t)  +c
n
(t; )+ _ v
we deduce the equations for v:
_ v =A
n
(t)v +a
 
n
(t; ;v); t2T
n
; (24)
where
a
 
n
(t; ;v) =A
n
(t)  +a
n
(t;  +v) C
n
(t)  c
n
(t; );
which we represent in the form
a
 
n
(t; ;v) =A
n
(t)  +a
n
(t;  +v) a
n
(t; ) C
n
(t)  +a
n
(t; ) c
n
(t; );
and the summands of the right-hand side of the above formula have the fol-
lowing properties: a
n
(t;  + v)  a
n
(t; ) vanishes for v = 0 and has small
Lipschitz constant inv for smalljvj (of course, if we impose a similar condition
on a
k
(t;x)) and a
n
(t; ) c
n
(t; ) is small (if the perturbed system is close to
the nonperturbed one).
Now we look at the \transition rule." From the equalities
x(l
n+1
) =B
n
x(r
n
) +b
n
(x(r
n
)) =B
n
 (r
n
) +B
n
v(r
n
) +b
n
( (r
n
) +v(r
n
))
= (l
n+1
) +v(l
n+1
) =D
n
 (r
n
) +d
n
( (r
n
)) +v(l
n+1
)
we deduce the relations
v(l
n+1
) =B
n
v(r
n
) +b
 
n
( (r
n
);v(r
n
)); n  1; (25)
where
b
 
n
( (r
n
);v) = (B
n
 D
n
) (r
n
)+b
n
( (r
n
)+v(r
n
)) b
n
( (r
n
))+b
n
( (r
n
)) d
n
( (r
n
)):
Thus, forv(t) we get system (??){(??) similar to the original one (with the
same A
n
(t) and B
n
but, of course, with different \small" nonlinear terms).
We solve this system in a standard way.
LetV be the space of continuous functions onT with values inX and with
the norm
kvk = sup
n 1
max
t2T
n
jv(t)j:

Clearly,V is a complete metric space with the metric  (v;w) =kv wk.
Our goal is to indicate conditions under which the \Perron operator" cor-
responding to system (??) and (??) has a  xed point inV whose norm we can
control.
