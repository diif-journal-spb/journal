Abstract. This paper is a survey of some recent results giving sufficient con-
ditions of shadowing for dynamical systems in the absence of hyperbolicity.
The main topics of the survey are as follows: method of pairs of Lyapunov type
functions,shadowinginaneighborhoodofanonisolatedfixedpoint,conditional
multiscale shadowing for sequences of mappings of a Banach space, conditional
shadowing for dynamical systems on so-called simple time scales. The paper
contains a new result on conditional multiscale shadowing in the case of an
infinite family of projections of the phase space.
Keywords: Dynamical system, pseudotrajectory, shadowing, hyperbolicity
1 Introduction
Thetheoryofshadowingofapproximatetrajectories(pseudotrajectories)is
nowanintensivelydevelopingbranchoftheglobaltheoryofdynamicalsystems.
One can find basic information concerning shadowing in the monographs [1-3];
the survey [4] is devoted to some recent results of the theory.
The main property of dynamical systems studied by the shadowing theory
can be stated as follows. Consider a homeomorphism f of a metric space
(X,dist). Let d > 0. A sequence {y
n
∈ X} is called a d-pseudotrajectory
of f if the inequalities
dist(f(y
n
),y
n+1
)<d (1)Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
hold.
One says that f has the (standard) shadowing property if for any ε > 0
there is a d>0 such that for any d-pseudotrajectory{y
n
} of f there is a point
x∈X for which
dist(f
n
(x),y
n
)<ε.
In this case, we say that the exact trajectory {f
n
(x)} ε-shadows the pseu-
dotrajectory{y
n
}.
Thefirstsufficientconditionsunderwhichadynamicalsystemhastheshad-
owing property were obtained by D.V. Anosov [5] and R. Bowen [6]. Applying
principally different approaches, they showed that, for a diffeomorphism, shad-
owing is a corollary of hyperbolicity (and, as easilly seen from the proofs in [5]
and [6], in a neighborhood of a hyperbolic set, a diffeomorphism has the Lip-
schitz shadowing property, i.e., there exists a constant L such that, for small
enough d, any d-pseudotrajectory is Ld-shadowed by an exact trajectory).
At present, relations between shadowing and hyperbolicity are well studied
(see the book [3] for details).
In the present paper, we give a survey of some recent results giving suffi-
cient conditions of shadowing in the absence of hyperbolicity. This survey is
motivatedbythetalkgivenbytheauthorattheJointPDMI–MIRANSession
“DifferentialEquationsandDynamicalSystems”(St. Petersburg, May12–14,
2023).
The paper also contains a new result – we generalize the main theorem
of the author’s paper [7] to the case of an infinite family of projections (see
Section 4 below). This generalization is not straightforward; in fact, we have
to work with different Banach spaces etc.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we describe the
method of pairs of Lyapunov type functions developed by A.A. Petrov and
the author in the paper [8]. This method is applied to a perturbation of the
hyperbolic automorphism of the 2-torus studied by J. Lewowicz in [9]. It is
noted that, using the described method, one can obtain sufficient conditions of
shadowing for nonsmooth systems.
In Section 3, it is shown that the method described in Section 2 can be
applied to study shadowing in a neighborhood of a fixed point belonging to a
“critical” manifold consisting of fixed points. In this case, not every pseudotra-
jectory in such a neighborhood can be shadowed, but it is possible to shadow
pseudotrajectories for which “one step errors” are small enough compared to
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.301 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 2Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
the distances of points of the pseudotrajectory to the critical manifold.
In Section 4, we study conditional shadowing for sequences of mappings of
a Banach space X. It is assumed that there exists a countable family of projec-
tions that commute with linear terms of the considered mappings. Conditions
of shadowing are obtained in terms of the norms of projections of one step er-
rors of pseudotrajectories and of estimates of Lipschitz constants of projections
of the “small nonlinear” terms. As mentioned above, the main theorem of this
section generalizes the result of the author’s paper [7] in which the case of a
finite family of projections has been studied.
Finally, in Section 5, we describe conditions of conditional shadowing for
dynamical systems on so-called simple time scales consisting of a family of
isolated segments of the positive ray of R; these results are obtained in the
author’s paper [10].
2 Method of a pair of Lyapunov type functions
Let f be a homeomorphism of a compact metric space (X,dist).
Weassumethatthereexisttwocontinuousnonnegativefunctions V andW
defined in a closed neighborhood of the diagonal of X× X such that
V(p,p)=W(p,p)=0 for any p∈X
andconditions(C1)-(C9)belowaresatisfied. Inwhatfollows, argumentsofthe
functions V and W are assumed to be close enough, so that the functions are
defined.
Our conditions are formulated not directly in terms of the functions V and
W but in terms of some geometric objects defined via these functions. Our
main reasoning for the choice of these form of conditions is as follows.
(1) Precisely these conditions are used in the proofs.
(2) It is relatively easy to check conditions of that kind for particular func-
tions V and W.
Let us introduce the main objects which we work with.
Fix positive numbers a and b and a point p∈X. Set
P(a,b,p)={q∈X : V(q,p)≤ a,W(q,p)≤ b},
Q(a,b,p)={q∈P(a,b,p): V(q,p)=a},
T(a,b,p)={q∈P(a,b,p): V(q,p)=0}.
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.301 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 3Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
Denote by B(ε,p) the open ε-ball centered at p and set
Int
0
P(a,b,p)={q∈P(a,b,p): V(q,p)<a,W(q,p)<b},
∂
0
P(a,b,p)=Q(a,b,p)∪{q∈P(a,b,p): W(q,p)=b},
Int
0
Q(a,b,p)={q∈P(a,b,p): V(q,p)=a,W(q,p)<b}.
Conditions (C1)-(C4) contain our assumptions on the geometry of the sets
introduced above.
(C1) For any ε>0 there exists a ∆ 0
=∆ 0
(ε)>0 such that
P(∆
0
,∆ 0
,p)⊂ B(ε,p) for p∈X.
There exists a ∆ 1
> 0 such that if p∈ X, δ 1
,δ 2
,∆ < ∆ 1
and δ 2
< ∆, then
there exists a number α =α (δ 1
,δ 2
,∆) >0 such that
(C2) Q(δ 1
,δ 2
,p) is not a retract of P(δ 1
,δ 2
,p);
(C3) Q(δ 1
,δ 2
,p) is a retract of P(δ 1
,δ 2
,p)\T(δ 1
,δ 2
,p);
(C4) there exists a retraction σ : P(δ 1
,∆ ,p)→P(δ 1
,δ 2
,p) such that
V(σ (q),p)≥ αV (q,p) for q∈P(δ 1
,∆ ,p).
In the next group of conditions, we state our assumptions on the behavior
of the introduced objects and their images under the homeomorphism f.
We assume that for any ∆ < ∆ 1
there exist positive numbers δ 1
,δ 2
< ∆ such that the following relations hold for any p∈X:
(C5)
f(P(δ 1
,δ 2
,p))∈Int
0
P(∆ ,∆ ,f(p)), f
− 1
(P(δ 1
,δ 2
,f(p)))∈Int

P(∆ ,∆ ,p);
(C6) f(T(δ 1
,δ 2
,p))⊂ Int
0
P(δ 1
,δ 2
,f(p));
(C7) f(T(δ 1
,∆ ,p))∩Q(δ 1
,δ 2
,f(p))=∅;
(C8) f(P(δ 1
,δ 2
,p))∩∂
0
P(δ 1
,δ 2
,f(p))⊂ Int
0
Q(δ 1
,δ 2
,f(p));
(C9) f(S(δ 1
,∆ ,p))∩P(δ 1
,δ 2
,f(p))=∅, where
S(δ 1
,∆ ,p)={q∈P(∆ ,∆ ,p): V(q,p)≥ δ 1
}.
Theorem 1 [8]. Under conditions (C1)-(C9), f has the finite shadowing
property (and hence, the standard shadowing property ) on the space X.

Let us give an example of application of Theorem 1 to a diffeomorphism
with nonhyperbolic behavior.
Example 1. Consider a diffeomorphism studied by Lewowicz in [9]. This
diffeomorphism is a perturbation of a hyperbolic automorphism of the 2-torus
T
2
.
Fix numbers 0<α < 1<β and a small r >0 and define a map F : R
2
→
R
2
by
F(x,y)=(αx +λ (x)µ (y),βy ),
where
λ (x)=
Z
x
0
((1− α )− h(s))ds,
h :R→R is a C
∞
function such that h(0) = 0, 0≤ h(x) < 1, and λ (x) = 0
for|x|≥ r, and µ :R→R is a C
∞
function such that µ (0)=1, µ (y)=µ (− y),
µ is not increasing for y≥ 0, and µ (y)=0 for|y|≥ r.
LetAbeanintegerhyperbolic2× 2matrixwithdetA=1. If0<α< 1<β are the eigenvalues of A andu
1
andu
2
are the corresponding eigenvectors, then
A(x,y)=(αx,βy )
in coordinates whose axes are parallel to u
1
and u
2
.
The lattice Ξ with vertices
{(n+1/2)u
1
,(m+1/2)u
2
: m,n∈Z}
is invariant with respect to the action of the map v7→Av. Let π : R
2
→R
2
/Ξ be the corresponding projection of the plane to the 2-torus.
Define f : T
2
→ T
2
by f(π (ξ,η )) = π ◦ F(x,y) (of course, we extend F
periodically with repect to the above-mentioned lattice).
It is shown in [9] that if r is small enough, then f is an expansive diffeo-
morphism of the 2-torus (see the definition below).
Note that the defined diffeomorphism f is not structurally stable since the
eigenvalues of Df at the zero fixed point are 1 and β .
At the same time, it is shown in [8] that conditions (C1)-(C9) are satisfied
for functions V and W defined as follows: If p = (p
x
,p
y
) and q = (q
x
,q
y
), then
V(p,q)=|p
y
− q
y
| and W(p,q)=|p
x
− q
x
| (such functions are properly defined
if p and q are close enough). Hence, Theorem 1 is applicable to f, and f has
the shadowing property.
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.301 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 5Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2023
Let us relate the obtained result to two classical properties of dynamical
systems, namely, to topological stability and expansivity.
Recall the standard definitions.
Denote by H(X) the space of homeomorphisms of a compact metric space
(X,dist) endowed with the metric
ρ (f,g)=max
p∈X
max(dist(f(p),g(p)),dist(f
− 1
(p),g
− 1
(p))).
A homeomorphism f is called topologically stable if for any ε > 0 there
exists a neighborhood Y of f in H(X) such that if g ∈ Y, then there exists a
continuous map h: X →X such that f◦ h=h◦ g and
dist(h(p),p)<ε, p∈X.
A homeomorphism f is called expansive if there exists a positive α such
that if
dist(f
k
(p),f
k
(q))≤ α, k ∈Z,
then p=q.
Walters in [11] proved that if a homeomorphism f is expansive and has the
shadowing property, then f is topologically stable.
Thus, we can apply Theorem 1 to establish the topological stability of the
diffeomorphism f in Example 1.
In his proof of topological stability of f, Lewowicz reduced the problem to
the study of suspension flows, which does not seem natural.
In its turn, Theorem 1 can be applied to nonsmooth homeomorphisms, for
example, to perturbations f of a hyperbolic automorphism of the 2-torus T
2
corresponding to the map
F(x,y)=(µ 1
(x),µ 2
(y)),
where µ 1
and µ 2
are increasing continuous functions for which there exist num-
bers r,λ ∈(0,1) such that
(1)|µ 1
(x+ν )− µ 1
(x)|≤ λ |ν | and λ − 1
|ν |≤| µ 2
(y+ν )− µ 2
(y)| for|ν |<r;
(2) µ 1
(x)=αx, |x|≥ r;
(3) µ 2
(y)=βy, |y|≥ r.
In this case, one can apply the same Lyapunov type functions V and W as
in Example 1.

3 Shadowing near a nonisolated fixed point
The method of Lyapunov type functions can be applied in the case of non-
isolatedfixedpoints. Ofcourse,ifafixedpoint pofahomeomorphismf belongs
to a submanifold M consisting of fixed points (as in the case studied below),
then f does not have the standard shadowing property in any neighborhood of
p. Nevertheless, sometimesitispossibletoestablisha“conditional”shadowing
propertyforpseudotrajectories{x
k
}whosepointsdonotbelongtoM assuming
that the size of “one step errors”
dist(x
k+1
,f(x
k
))
is small compared to the distances from the points x
k
to the manifold M.
Such an approach (in the case of a nontransverse homoclinic point) had been
suggested by S. Tikhomirov.
Let us restrict our consideration to a simple (but nontrivial) example of the
2-dimensional diffeomorphism
f(x,y)=
 
x
2
,y(1+x
2
)
 
. (2)
The origin is a nonisolated fixed point of f (every point of the line M =
{(0,y): y∈R} is a fixed point).
Represent p∈R
2
in the form p = (p
x
,p
y
) and consider a finite pseudotra-
jectory p
0
,...,p
n
of f such that (p
k
)
x
̸=0 and
|f(p
k
)− p
k+1
|≤ d(p
k
)
2
x
, k =0,...,n− 1, (3)
for some d>0. Set
K
0
={(x,y): 0<|x|<1}.
In [12], the following result is proved.
Theorem 2. There exists a neighborhood K of the origin and a number
c > 0 such that, for any ε > 0 and for any pseudotrajectory p
0
,...,p
n
of f in
K∩K
0
that satisfies conditions (3) with d=cε, there exists a point p satisfying
the inequalities
|f
k
(p)− p
k
|≤ ε, 0≤ k≤ n.
In the proof of this result, the method of the previous section is applied;
the corresponding Lyapunov type functions are
V(q,p)=|p
y
− q
y
| and W(q,p)=
|p
x
− q
x
|
|p
x
((1−| p

.

Analyzing the proof, one can see that the method is applicable not only to
diffeomorphism (2) but in more general situations as well.
4 Multiscale conditional shadowing
Let X be a Banach space with norm|.|. Consider a sequence f
n
, n≥ 0, of
mappings of the space X having the form
f
n
(x)=A
n
x+g
n
(x), (4)
where A
n
are linear mappings.
A sequence x
n
∈X, n≥ 0, is called a trajectory of (4) if
x
n+1
=f
n
(x
n
), n≥ 0.
Let n≥ m≥ 0; set
Φ( n,n)=Id
and
Φ( n,m)=A
n− 1
··· A
m
if n>m.
We fix a family of projections P
k,n
of the space X, where k∈K and n≥ 0;
here K is a countable index set having the form K =KS∪KU.
It is assumed that the projections P
k,n
have the following properties:
P
i,n
P
j,n
=0 if i̸=j;
X
k∈K
P
k,n
=Id for n≥ 0;
and
A
n
P
k,n
=P
k,n+1
A
n
for k∈K and n≥ 0. (5)
Of course, property (5) implies that
Φ( n,m)P
k,m
=P
k,n
Φ( n,m) for k∈K and n≥ m. (6)
Let k∈K and n≥ 0; denote by X
k,n
the image P
k,n
X.
We assume, in addition, that the restrictions of A
n
to X
k,n
are invertible
for k∈KU; this allows us to define for k∈KU the operators
Ψ( n,m)=A

acting from X
k,m
to X
k,n
with n<m. We agree that
Ψ( n,n+1)=A
− 1
n

X
k,n+1
.
Formally, we have to write Ψ k
(n,m) instead of Ψ( n,m), but the present
short form will lead to no misunderstanding.
Of course, an analog of property (6) is valid; if k∈KU and n<m, then
Ψ( n,m)P
k,m
=P
k,n
Ψ( n,m).
We make the following
Main assumption. There exists a number M > 0 and two sequences of
positive numbers α k,n
and β k,n
with the following properties.
The inequalities

Ofcourse,thechoiceofsequencesα k,n

our future estimates essentially depend on this choice.

(Of course, we work with sequences V for which the above values are finite).
We emphasize that the value∥v

Let y

Introduce functions

Note that γ n

Our goal is to find a trajectory x

of (4) for which we can estimate the
values
|x

|, n≥ 0,
in terms of the values δ n
(to be exact, in terms of the values |P

| and of
Lipschitz constants of the functions P

γ n− 1
).
Represent x

in the form

then it follows from the equalities

Our main result in this section is the following statement.
Theorem 3. Let conditions (7)–(10) be satisfied. Fix a positive d and
assume that
|P

Assume, in addition, that Lipschitz constants of the projections P

Then there exists a solution V of Eq. (11) such that
∥V∥

Proof. The set

which, combined with (16), gives us the estimates

Similar reasoning based on inequalities (9) and (10) shows that analogs of
estimates (17) are valid for k∈KU as well. Thus, T mapsV into itself.

Let k = 1; then∥Φ( n,n)P

we take α 1,n

for all n, then

∥Φ( n,l)P

Let k = 2; then ∥Φ( n,l)P

then

Thus, we get estimate (7) in the form

and one can repeat a similar procedure in the general case of infinite set KS
with an arbitrary series m

Finally, if k = 4, then∥Ψ( n,l)P

∥ = 2
n− l
for n < l, and, as for k = 2, we
may take the constant sequence α 4,n
=M to get estimate (9).
After that, we can similarly select the sequences β k,n
(we leave details to
the reader).
5 Perturbations of dynamical systems on simple time scales
Let us consider a simple variant of a time scaleT that is a subset of [0,∞)
and consists of isolated segments T

, where n = 1,2,..., T
n
= [l
n
,r
n
], and

The phase space is a Banach space X with norm |·|. We denote by ∥·∥
the operator norm of a linear operator.

The system on T

is generated by a differential equation
˙ x=A
n

n
. (18)
We assume that the operators A
n
(t) are continuous and bounded on T
n
. The
functions a
n
(t,x) are assumed to be continuous and Lipschitz continuous in x
on T
n
× X (with small Lipschitz constants).

where B

is a linear operator and b

(x) is a continuous function (it is not
assumed, in general, that any operator B

is an isomorphism of the space X).
The trajectory x(t), t ∈ T, of the appearing system starting at a point
x

∈X at the time moment l

(the left-hand end of the segment T

as follows:

We fix countable sets of indices KS and KU and assume that there exist
families of continuous projections P

k∈K =KS

Let us write down the analog of the Perron operator for the functions y

Perturbations. The natural statement of the perturbation problem is as
follows.
We replace systems (18) on the segments T
n
by systems
˙ x=C
n
(t)x+c
n
(t,x)
(assuming that the operators C
n
(t) and the functions c
n
(t,x) have properties
similar to those of A
n
(t) and a
n
(t,x)) and the maps B
n
x + b
n
(x) by similar
maps D
n
x+d
n
(x), take a trajectory ξ (t) of the new system and look for a close
trajectory x(t) of the original system.

Asusual, wearelookingforfunctions v(t)onT
n
withvaluesinX suchthat
x(t)=ξ (t)+v(t), t∈T
n
.
From the relations
˙ x=A
n
(t)x+a
n
(t,x)=A
n
(t)(ξ +v)+a
n
(t,ξ +v)=
˙
ξ +˙ v =C
n
(t)ξ +c
n
(t,ξ )+˙ v
we deduce the equations for v:
˙ v =A
n
(t)v+a
∗ n
(t,ξ,v ), t∈T
n
, (24)
where
a
∗ n
(t,ξ,v )=A
n
(t)ξ +a
n
(t,ξ +v)− C
n
(t)ξ − c
n
(t,ξ ),
which we represent in the form
a
∗ n
(t,ξ,v )=A
n
(t)ξ +a
n
(t,ξ +v)− a
n
(t,ξ )− C
n
(t)ξ +a
n
(t,ξ )− c
n
(t,ξ ),
and the summands of the right-hand side of the above formula have the fol-
lowing properties: a
n
(t,ξ + v)− a
n
(t,ξ ) vanishes for v = 0 and has small
Lipschitz constant in v for small|v| (of course, if we impose a similar condition
on a
k
(t,x)) and a
n
(t,ξ )− c
n
(t,ξ ) is small (if the perturbed system is close to
the nonperturbed one).
Now we look at the “transition rule.” From the equalities
x(l
n+1
)=B
n
x(r
n
)+b
n
(x(r
n
))=B
n
ξ (r
n
)+B
n
v(r
n
)+b
n
(ξ (r
n
)+v(r
n
))
=ξ (l
n+1
)+v(l
n+1
)=D
n
ξ (r
n
)+d
n
(ξ (r
n
))+v(l
n+1
)
we deduce the relations
v(l
n+1
)=B
n
v(r
n
)+b
∗ n
(ξ (r
n
),v(r
n
)), n≥ 1, (25)
where
b
∗ n
(ξ (r
n
),v)=(B
n
− D
n
)ξ (r
n
)+b
n
(ξ (r
n
)+v(r
n
))− b
n
(ξ (r
n
))+b
n
(ξ (r
n
))− d
n
(ξ (r
n
)).
Thus, for v(t) we get system (24)–(25) similar to the original one (with the
same A
n
(t) and B
n
but, of course, with different “small” nonlinear terms).
We solve this system in a standard way.
LetV be the space of continuous functions onT with values in X and with
the norm
∥v∥=sup
n≥ 1
max
t∈T
n
|v(t)|.

Clearly,V is a complete metric space with the metric ρ (v,w)=∥v− w∥.
Our goal is to indicate conditions under which the “Perron operator” cor-
responding to system (24) and (25) has a fixed point in V whose norm we can
control.
