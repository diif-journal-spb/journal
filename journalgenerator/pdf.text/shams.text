Abstract
In this note, we present a reliable process for computing the determinant of any general
block pentadiagonal and block heptadiagonal matrices with (or without) corners. Then
we extend this process for  nding determinant of block anti-pentadiagonal and block anti-
heptadiagonal matrices. We do this work by determinant of a block tridiagonal matrix
and expansions det(X) = exp(trace(log(X))).

is unknown. These equations applied for the thigh binding model for a crystal,
a molecule, or a particle in a lattice with random potential or hopping ampli-
tudes.
In [5, 7], Molinari and Salkuyeh proposed different processes for  nding de-
terminant of BTD with(or without) corners. In this note, we present ap-
proximations for the determinant of block pentadiagonal and block hepta-
diagonal matrices with(or without) corners by reblocking and expansions of
det(X) =exp(trace(log(X))).
We expand this process for block anti-pentadiagonal and anti-heptadiagonal
matrix with(or without) corners.
We do this work by determinant of a block tridiagonal matrix. This work
has the ability to save time and memory specially for some large block band
matrices. This process can use for parallel computing and solving differential
equations using  nite differences.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in the next section, we present
a process for  nding determinant of general block pentadiagonal and block
heptadiagonal matrices. In section 3 we expand this method for block band
matrices with corners. Finally compute an approximation for determinant by
det(X) =exp(trace(log(X))).
1.1 Notation
We will often (but not always)use the following convention:
BTD for block tridiagonal matrix.
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 38Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2012
BPD for block pentadiagonal matrix.
BHD for block heptadiagonal matrix.
BAPD for block anti-pentadiagonal matrix.
BAHD for block anti-heptadiagonal matrix.
log(X) and exp(X) denote logarithm and exponential function of a matrix.
ln(x) and e
x
denote the natural logarithm and exponential function of a scalar
x. The eigenvalues of a complex square matrix T are  
j
(T ) and its spectral
radius is  (T ) max
j
j 
j
(T )j.
I
n
(or simply I if its dimension is clear) is the n n identity matrix.
2 Computing the Determinant for Block Pentadiagonal
and Block Heptadiagonal Matrices
In [5, 7], are proposed different processes for  nding determinant of BTD. We
try to change these process for BPD and BHD. Also we extend this process for
BAPD and BAHDs.
Consider determinant for matrix M,

This work helps us for  nding det(M) by BTD N in Equations( 5), ( 7) and
( 8):

use above partitions.

For  nding determinant of matrices AP and AH, we use the permutation ma-
trices.
For permutation matrix Q, we can proof:
Q =Inverse(Q) =Transpose(Q)
see [2]. Also for  nding determinant of BAPD and BAHD, we use of permuta-
tion matrix:
P =AP Q

and H =AH Q

Transfer BAPD and BAHD to BTD, by block permutation matrices and devised
matrices in Theorems 1 and 2.

Now by BTD in Equation( 11), we have: det(M) =det(N)
By above theorems we can  nd determinant for Matrix M in Equations( 1),( 2)
by BTD. We consider the determinant for block tridiagonal matrix N in Equa-
tion( 11) by method in [5]. In this method transfer matrix T built as the
product of l matrices of size (2m  2m) for  nding det(N).

Theorem 5 Let T be a complex matrix of order n, withkTk< 1 and ( 
i
;i =
1; 2:::;n) are eigenvalues of T then
det(I T ) =exp(
n
X
i=1
ln(1  
i
))
Proof. IfkTk< 1 then I T is nonsingular and  (T )< 1 [1].
We have det(I T ) =exp(trace(log(I T ))) see [3].
From the linearity of the trace [4] and the fact that trace(T
p
) =
P
n
i=1
 
i
(T )
p
,
also by power series for any  
i
withj

j< 1 follow:
log(I T ) =log(I + ( T )) =

p

p

(14)
so
det(I T ) =exp(trace(log(I T ))) =exp(
n
X
i=1
ln(1  
i
)) (15)
Corollary 1 If matrix N in Equation( 11) is nonsingular and  (T ) < 1, we
have
detN = ( 1)
lm m
exp(
2m
X
i=1
ln(1  
i
))det(H
1
:::H
l
) (16)
Suppose every block in matrix N is m m.
Proof. If N is nonsingular so T I is nonsingular (Lemma 1 in [5]). Since
matrix T is 2m  2m then det(I  T ) = det(T   I) and det(I  T ) =
exp(trace(log(I T ))). Now by  (T ) < 1 and proof of Theorem( 5), we have
Equation( 16).

4 Summary
In this paper, we present a sequence of approximations for determinant of BPD,
BHD, BAPD and BAHD with(or without) corners, this work is done by BTD
and expansions det(X) =exp(trace(log(X))).
Introduced processes in this paper try to  nd determinant for some block band
matrices by determinant of a transfer matrix with smaller rank. This work can
save time and memory specially for some large band matrices. We can apply
this process for parallel computing, telecommunication system analysis and in
solving differential equations using  nite differences.
