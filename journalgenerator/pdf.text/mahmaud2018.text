Abstract
In this paper, by using the Mawhin coincidence degree theory and analysis techniques,
we establish new results on the existence and uniqueness of T-periodic solutions for a kind
of third-order functional differential equation (FDE) with a time-delay.
The obtained results are new and complement the related results of third-order (FDE)
with a time-delay that have appeared in the literature. In the last section, we give an
example to illustrate our main results of periodic solutions.

1 Introduction
In recent years numerous methods have been developed to study the dif-
ferential equations (DEs). Exact methods (quantitative), in which all the so-
lutions are known and could be written in closed form in terms of elementary
functions or sometime special functions. There are also some other type of
methods, called analytical methods (qualitative), in which one can describe theDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2018
behaviour of a differential equation's solution, such as existence of solutions,
uniqueness, stability, instability, chaotic or asymptotic character, boundedness,
periodicity, etc., without actually solving it exactly. This is an important and
relatively new step in the theory of (DEs), because most of the (DEs) cannot
be solved exactly.
The investigation of the qualitative properties of solutions of (FDEs) for
higher-order of solutions play an important role in many real world phenomena
related to the sciences and engineering technique  elds. (FDEs) of higher-
order can serve as excellent tools for description of mathematical modeling of
systems and processes in population dynamics, stochastic processes, physics,
control theory, neural networks, mechanics, etc.
Existence and uniqueness of periodic solutions for (FDEs) are of great in-
terest in mathematics and its applications to the modeling of various practical
problems.
In recent years, many books and papers dealt with the existence and unique-
ness of periodic solutions for (FDEs) with applications and obtained many good
results, for example, [3, 7, 8, 11, 12], etc.
Continuation theorem of coincidence degree theory plays a signi cant role
in the investigation of the existence of periodic solutions for (FDEs) of higher-
order.
The existence and uniqueness of periodic solutions of third-order (FDEs)
with a or more deviating arguments have been widely investigated and are still
being investigated, for example, (see [1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21], and the references therein).
In 2010, Tun  c [15] established certain su cient conditions by using the
Lyapunov functional approach for the existence of a periodic solution of the
nonlinear differential equation of the third-order with constant deviating argu-
ment (  > 0)
...
x + ( _ x)  x +g( _ x(t  )) +f(x) =p(t;x;x(t  ); _ x; _ x(t  );  x):
Moreover, In 2011, Abou-El-Ela, Sadek and Mahmoud [1] studied the existence
and uniqueness of periodic solutions to third-order delay differential equation
with a deviating argument of the form
...
x(t) +f(t;x(t))  x(t) +g(x(t)) _ x(t) +h(t;x(t r(t))) =p(t):
The main objective of this work is to establish criteria to guarantee the existence
and uniqueness of aT -periodic solution for third-order (FDE) with a time-delay
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 193Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2018
as the following form
...
x(t) +f( _ x(t))( x(t))
2
+g(t;x(t)) _ x(t) +h(t;x(t  (t))) =p(t): (1.1)
We can write Equation (1.1) in the following equivalent system
_ x =y; _ y =z;
_ z = f(y)z
2
 g(t;x(t))y h(t;x(t  (t))) +p(t);
(1.2)
wheref; ;p :R!R andh;g :R R!R are continuous functions;f(0) = 0,
  and p are T -periodic, and g is T -periodic in the  rst argument with period
T > 0.
By applying the continuation theorem of the coincidence degree theory, we
obtain new results, which complement previously known results. An illustrative
example is given in the last section.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we state some
preliminary results and other technical details and we shall prove the main
existence results and in section 3 we shall establish main result s of uniqueness.
We will give an example of an application in section 4.
2 Preliminary Results
In this section we give some technical, yet elementary results, that will serve
us well in the section that follows.
For ease of exposition throughout this article we shall adopt the following
notation:

De ne a linear operator L :D(L) X!Y by setting
D(L) =fxjx2X;
...
x(t)2C(R;R)g;
and for x2D(L)
Lx =

x(t): (2.1)
We also de ne a nonlinear operator N :X!Y by setting
Nx = f( _ x(t))( x(t))
2
 g(t;x(t)) _ x(t) h(t;x(t  (t))) +p(t): (2.2)
Then we notice that
KerL =R and ImL =fyjy2Y;
Z

y(s)ds = 0g:
Thus the operator L is a Fredholm operator with index zero.
De ne the continuous projectorP :X!KerL and the averaging projector

Px(t) =

T

Hence ImP = KerL and KerQ = ImL. Denoting by L

Therefore we can see from (2.2) and the above equation, that N is L-compact
on
 

, where 
 is an open bounded subset in X.
To prove the main result of existence and uniqueness of a T-periodic solution
for the third-order functional differential equation with a deviating argument,
we use the continuation theorem of coincidence degree theory and analysis tech-
niques.
For convenience of use, we introduce the continuation theorem of coinci-
dence degree theory formulated in [4] as follows.
Theorem 2.1 let X and Y be two Banach spaces. Suppose that L : D(L) 
X! Y is a Fredholm operator with index zero and N : X! Y is L-compact
on
 

, where 
 is an open bounded subset in X. In addition, if the following
conditions hold:

\D(L) and  2 (0; 1);
(2) QNx6= 0; for all x2@
\KerL;
(3) degfQN; 
\KerL; 0g6= 0:
Then equation Lx =Nx has at least one solution on
 

.
It is convenient to introduce the following assumption.
(A
0
) Assume that there exist non-negative constants c
1
and c
2
such that

for all y;y

2R; andjg(t;x)j c
2
, for all t;x2R.
In view of (2.1) and (2.2) the operator equation
Lx = Nx;
is equivalent to the following equation
...
x(t) + ff( _ x(t))( x(t))
2
+g(t;x(t)) _ x(t) +h(t;x(t  (t)))g = p(t); 2 (0; 1):
(2.3)
The following lemmas are very important to prove the existence of the most
one T-periodic solution of (1.1).
Lemma 2.1 Suppose that there exists a constant d> 0 such that
(A
1
) xfh(t;x) p(t)g< 0; for all t2R and jxj d:
If x(t) is a T -periodic solution of (2.3), then

Proof. Let x(t) be a T -periodic solution of (2.3) for a certain  2 (0; 1). Set
x(t
1
) = max
t2R
x(t); x(t
2
) = min
t2R
x(t); where t

;t

therefore we obtain
_ x(t

...
x(t

)  0; and _ x(t
2

2
)  0;
...
x(t
2
)  0:
Electronic Journal. http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal 196Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2018
It follows from (2.3) that
h(t

2

Taking this together with (A
1
) as appropriate we have
x(t
1
  (t

  (t

Since x(t  (t)) is a continuous function on R, this implies that there exists
 2R such that
jx(   ( ))j d:
let    ( ) =mT +t

Therefore (1.1) has at most one T-periodic solution.
This completes the proof of Theorem 2.2.
3 Main Result
The following theorem is the main result of the uniqueness of a T-periodic
solution of (1.1).
Theorem 3.1 Suppose that (A
0
) (A
3
) hold, then (1.1) has a unique T-periodic
solution.
Proof. By Theorem 2.2 states that (1.1) has at most one T-periodic solution.
Thus to prove Theorem 3.1 it su ces to show that (1.1) has at least one T-
periodic solution. To do this, we shall apply Theorem 2.1.
First we shall claim that the set of all possible T-periodic solutions of (2.3) is
bounded.
Let x(t) be a T-periodic solution of (2.3). Multiplying (2.3) by
...
x(t) and then
integrating it from 0 to T in view of (A

So the conditions (1) and (2) in Theorem 2.1 hold.

H(x; ) = (1  )x  :

It follows from (A

Thus H(x; ) is a homotopy.
Hence by using the homotopy invariance theorem we have

So condition (3) of Theorem 2.1 is satis ed.
In view of all the discussions above, we conclude from Theorem 2.1 that the
main Theorem 3.1 is proved.
4 Example
In this section we shall provide an example to validate the main results.
Example 4.1. Let h(t;x) = 
1

x, for all t;x2 R. Then we get the
third-order (FDE) with a time-delay as the following form
...
x(t)

=

e

t
; (4.1)
has a unique  -periodic solution.
Proof. By (4.1) we obtain
g(t;x) =
1

sin 4t; f(y) = arctany; h(t;x(t  (t)) = 
x(t sin

t)

;
 (t) = sin

It is obvious that the assumptions (A

Hence by Theorem 3.1, equation (4.1) has a unique  -periodic solution.

5 Conclusion
Based on the coincidence degree theory and analysis techniques, new results
on the existence and uniqueness of a T-periodic solution for the third-order
functional differential equation, with a time-delay have been established. The
obtained results extend existing results in the literature on deterministic sys-
tems. In addition an example is given to illustrate the new main results, which
we obtain in this paper.
