Optimal dynamic measurement method

Abstract. We consider one of the mathematical models of the theory of op-
timal dynamic measurements to solve the problem of recovering a dynamically
distorted signal in the presence of noise. The measuring device is simulated by
a Leontief-type system which is a  nite-dimensional analogue of a Sobolev-type
equation, and its initial state is given by the Showalter { Sidorov condition.
In order to  nd the input signal from the known observed signal, an optimal
control problem, namely the minimization of the penalty functional in which
the simulated and observed output signals are compared should be solved. The
solution of this problem is called the optimal dynamic measurement. The the-
orem on the existence of a unique exact solution of the problem posed and the
algorithm of the spline method for  nding an approximate solution are given.
At the same time, the presence of noise at the output of the measuring device
does not give a possibility to solve the problem of recovering a dynamically
distorted signal satisfactorily. In the article we propose to use in the numerical
algorithm the Savitsky-Golay digital  lter for the observed signal. As a result,
we obtain an observation smoothed by the  lter, which is then used in the
penalty functional. The choice of parameters for the Savitsky-Golay digital
 lter is discussed, and the results of computational experiments on the data of
bench tests are presented.Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 1, 2021

1 Introduction
The main problem of dynamic measurements is recovery of a dynamically dis-
torted signal (input signal) by the observed one (output signal) with known
parameters of the mathematical model of the measuring device [1]. Various
mathematical methods and models [2]{[4] can be used as the basis for the an-
alytical implementation of the virtual model for recovering a dynamically dis-
torted signal. In this paper, we use the methods of the recently created [5] and
actively developing [6],[7] theory of optimal dynamic measurements. This the-
ory accumulates methods of the theory of optimal control, equations of Sobolev
and Leontief types, dynamic measurements and automatic control.
The work [8] proposes to use the differential-algebraic system
(
_ x =Ax +Bu;
y =Cx +D 
(1)
as a mathematical model of the measuring device. In addition to (1), the model
also contains the initial Cauchy condition
x(0) =x

which de nes the initial state of the measuring system, x

: In (1), x(t),
y(t), u(t) are the vector functions of the states of the measuring system, the
observed signal and the input signal, respectively, A is a square matrix of the
order n characterizing the measuring device, the matrix B characterizes the
relationship between the input of the system and its state, the matrices C and D
characterize the relationship between the state of the system and observations,
 (t) is a vector function of noise at the output of the measuring system.
In the general case, when a measuring device is a complex system, for
example, consisting of several sensors, it is necessary to use the Leontief type
system, which is a  nite-dimensional analogue of the Sobolev type equation [9]
(
L _ x =Ax +Bu +G ;
y =Cx +D ;
(3)
where detL = 0, L is a square matrix of the order n characterizing the measuring
system,  (t) is a vector function of noise at the input and in the circuits of the

measuring system, the matrix G characterizes the relationship between the
state of the system and the corresponding noise.
Therefore, the  rst equation of system (3) is a Leontief type system, i.e.
a degenerate system of ordinary differential equations. At the same time, the
Leontief type system is a  nite-dimensional analogue of the Sobolev type equa-
tion, therefore, the Showalter { Sidorov condition

is taken as the initial one. In problem (3), (4), the matrix A is (L; p)-regular,

(M) [10]. The results of the solvability of the Showalter - Sidorov
problem for the Sobolev type equation give a possibility to develop numerical
methods for solving initial and optimal control problems, both for the equations
mentioned above and Leontief type systems [10]. At present, methods and
models of the theory of optimal dynamic measurements are designed which
are based on the development of the theory of Sobolev type equations [11, 12]
and numerical methods [13]. Such methods allow investigating the problem of
optimal dynamic measurements in the presence of "white noise" and to increase
the e ciency of numerical methods.
The article presents a new algorithmic implementation of a virtual model
of optimal dynamic measurements. We propose to apply the Savitsky - Golay
digital  lter [14] to the observation data with the subsequent application of
the spline method of optimal dynamic measurements. Basing on the results
of computational experiments with various parameters of the digital  lter, we
give recommendations on the use of the  lter and draw conclusions about the
effectiveness of the new algorithmic implementation of the virtual model under
study.

tional reects the assessment of the proximity of the real observation y

the observation y(t) obtained on the basis of the mathematical model of the

lem of optimal dynamic measurements. Note that in the absence of noise, the
distortion of the input signal is due to the inertia of the measuring device.
In the presence of deterministic noises, for example, resonances, only at
the output of the measuring device, in order to restore a dynamically distorted
signal, it is permissible to use the penalty functional of the form (8). In this
case, problem (1), (4), (6) { (8) is considered. In the presence of deterministic
noise both at the output and at the input of the measuring device, the quality
functional has the form

ment. Therefore, in this case, we consider problem (3), (4), (6), (7), (9). Note
that the bracketed expression acts as an observation  lter. This approach is
acceptable only in the case of determinism of the noise, which is reproduced in
each experiment. However, this situation should be characterized as a model
one, since the situation is hardly possible in real experiments. Moreover, with
noise in the form of "white noise", such a situation is not possible, since each
observation is one realization of a random process.

the approximate solution to the problem on optimal dynamic measurement to
the exact one in the norm is proved. The following theorem is true.

However, the original numerical method required a lot of computing power
and time. Therefore, a spline method was proposed for  nding the optimal
dynamic measurements.
Let us describe the spline method for solving the problem of optimal dy-
namic measurement (4) { (8).

Let us consider the result of the implementation of the spline method algo-
rithm (without using a digital  lter) in the presence of noise at the output of
the measuring device. Therefore, the spline method solves the following opti-
mal dynamic measurement problem. The measuring device is simulated by the
system

y =Cx +D ;

achieved.
At the stand, the Metran-43 sensor with an analog electronic converter was
tested, a test signal and an output signal of the tested sensor were obtained.

reconstructed by the spline method (red line).
In order to smooth the output signal, we use the Savitsky - Golay digital
 lter [14], which is a noise  ltering technique based on the least squares method.
The idea is to construct an s-th degree approximating polynomial by 2 +1
sequential equidistant points and use the polynomial value at the +1-th point
as a smoothed value.
Hence, we obtain the following algorithm for the numerical solution of the
optimal dynamic measurement problem (14), (4), (6) { (8) with the combined
use of the Savitsky - Golay digital  lter and the spline method.
Step 0. Determine the parameters   and s of the Savitsky - Golay digital
 lter and apply the  lter to the array of the values Y

. As a result, we get the
smoothed values y

Assuming that the effect of noise at the output is eliminated by smoothing
by the  lter, we proceed to the implementation of the spline method to solution
of problem (4) { (8) taking the smoothed valuesy

as the array of observations.
Steps 1 { 4 are implemented.
4 Computational experiments
In computational experiments, we apply the Savitsky - Golay digital  lter at
various values of the parameters

{  =10, s=3;
{  =10, s=1;
{  =15, s=3
to the array of observations (s-th degree approximating polynomial by 2 +1
sequential equidistant points and use the polynomial value at the +1-th point
as a smoothed value).
Fig. 2 shows the result of a computational experiment with a smoothing
window containing 11 counts ( =5) and an approximating polynomial of the
third degree.

shows that the use of an approximating polynomial of the  rst degree allows
to achieve a smaller error in the discrepancy between the test and simulated
signals.

Note that with a smoothing window containing 11 counts, the lag effect is
completely eliminated. Signi cant deviations at the end and beginning of the
time interval are due to the failure to apply a digital  lter to the  rst  ve and
last  ve counts.
Fig. 4 shows the result of a computational experiment with a smoothing
window containing 21 counts ( =10) and an approximating polynomial of the
third degree.

Analysis of the results of these two computational experiments shows that
the use of an approximating polynomial of the  rst degree allows to achieve a
smaller dynamic error in comparison with a polynomial of the third degree. In
both cases, the shift is required to be insigni cant, namely, to be equal to 7 
to the left along the time axis t.

window containing 21 counts, an approximating polynomial of the third degree
and a shift of 7 counts to the left along the axis t.

Comparison of the results shows that the implementation of a shift reduces
the dynamic error, and a visual analysis of the corresponding graphs of ^ v
`
(t
i
),
for example, Fig. 4 and Fig. 6, at local extrema ^ u(t
i
) shows a more accurate
restoration of the signal in the presence of a shift (Fig. 6).
Computational experiments with a larger smoothing window (more than 21
counts) lead to an increase in the dynamic error. Similar results with respect
to the size of the smoothing window were obtained using the moving average
 lter [15].
In addition, on the basis of the Kotelnikov theorem, the connection between
the length of the interval of the smoothing window and the value of the max-
imum frequency f
c
, which limits the spectrum of the desired input signal, is
shown.
Fig. 8 shows the result of a computational experiment with a smoothing
window containing 31 counts ( =15) and an approximating polynomial of the
third degree.
Despite the fact that the error in this case is smaller compared to the
smoothing window containing 21 counts, we emphasize that in the neiborhood
of a number of local extrema, for example, at t=0,0225 s, the values of the opti-

mal dynamic measurement are signi cantly less than the test signal (smoothing
effect). In solving certain applied problems (for example, design), such a situ-
ation may turn out to be unacceptable.

smoothing window of 31 counts and an approximating polynomial of the third degree
Conclusions and recommendations
The application of the Savitsky - Golay digital  lter to the observed sig-
nal when recovering a dynamically distorted signal by the method of optimal
dynamic measurement allows to draw the following conclusions. The counts
contained in the smoothing window must belong to an interval equal to 2 ,
where 0<4  1=2f
c
, f
c
is the maximum frequency that limits the spectrum
of the desired input signal.
A smaller error is achieved when using an approximating polynomial of the
 rst degree. The elimination of the lag effect is proposed by shift of m counts
to the left such that m   24=3. In the future, with the similar statement of
the problem, other types of digital  lters will be considered.
