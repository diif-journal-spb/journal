Abstract. In the paper the Simple Adaptive Control approach is employed
to design the adaptive controllers for controlling both angular and transla-
tional motion. The adaptive controllers are synthesized based on the Implicit
Reference Model (IRM) design technique. The \shunting method" (parallel
feedforward compensation) is used to mitigate the relative degree restriction.
Parametric feedback is used to prevent the increasing of controller coe cients
caused by external disturbances or sensor noise. Quality of the closed-loop
IRM adaptive control system is studied based on the series of simulations for
ensuring the system stability and tracking cases.
Keywords: quadrotor, simple adaptive control, passi cation, cyber-physical
system.
1 Introduction
In the last decade, interest in using UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) of the
helicopter type (hexacopters, quadrotors, etc.) has increased signi cantly inDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2020
various  elds, such as surface, environmental and tra c monitoring, studying
of atmospheric ows and etc. In many missions, the parameters of the UAV
are subject to signi cant changes or a priori unknown. This happens, for ex-
ample, due to a change in load from one ight to another ight or changes may
occur during a UAV ight depending on external environment properties, i.e.
windage. The presence of cranes or mobile manipulators, which are mounted
on the UAV, also leads to a signi cant change in the UAV parameters. As a
result, in the recent years a signi cant amount of work has been done on the
use of adaptation methods for designing multirotors mini-UAV control systems.
Many factors can affect to changing the UAV dynamics and, as a consequence,
the control quality. Some applications require adding some physical load such
as video cameras, packages and etc to quadrotors. So it is very important to
use control system that could be exible and adaptive for plants parameter
variations.
Two types of nonlinear controllers for an autonomous quadrotor helicopter
are presented in [22]: feedback linearization controller and an adaptive sliding
mode controller using input augmentation to take into account the helicopter
underactuated property. It has been demonstrated that the sliding mode con-
troller is e cient in the case of ground effects.
The approaches above mainly lead to quite complex adaptive control laws.
In the present work, the Simple Adaptive Control (SAC) method, jointly with
\shunting" (parallel feedforward compensation) is used for controlling both
angular and translational motion. We deal with the ultralight quadrotor,
which is a part of the research complex QuadRoy (Swarm of Quadrotors),
see [1, 4, 29, 31, 32], which was developed in the IPME RAS. The quadrotors
are supplied with autopilot Pixhawk, the Inertial Navigation System (including
gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, barometer) and the GPS receiver.
The SAC approach is being intensively developed since the 1970s, see [2,5,
8{10, 26, 30], for mentioning a few. Among the advantages of this method as
opposed to the conventional Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC, [20])
method are low order and computational simplicity of the control algo-
rithms and the weakening the restrictions imposed by the so-called matching
(Erzberger) condition, see [18]. The SAC method has been successfully applied
to the various adaptive control problems, such as control of power systems [36],
robotic systems [25,27], spacecrafts [6,21,33], aircraft [15,34], fault tolerant con-
trol [14,19], etc. SAC method was designed and successfully used for quadrotor
attitude control [7,31]. Computational simplicity is essential for small quadrotor

autopilots because most autopilots are equipped with low powerful microproces-
sors for computing control signals, processing sensors data, sending telemetry
over communication channels, etc.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Firstly, the SAC scheme based
on the passi cation method is briey recalled in Sec. 2. The SAC laws for control
both angular and translational motion are derived in Sec. 3. The simulation
results of testing proposed algorithms are presented in Sec. 4. Concluding
remarks and the future work intentions  nalize the paper.
2 Adaptive Controllers With Implicit Reference Model
A simple tool for SAC design is the Passi cation method. Passi cation means
rendering the closed loop system passive by output feedback, see [2, 10, 13] for
the details. The main condition following from this method lies in the so-
called hyper minimum phase (HMP) property, imposed on the plant model:
_ x(t) = Ax(t) +Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t), where x(t)2 R

where I

>0. For the special
casem = 1 (SISO systems) considered in this paper the HMP property coincides
with the standard minimum-phase, relative-degree-one property. Passi cation
method makes it possible to create SAC with the Implicit Reference Model
(IRM), of an order that can be signi cantly less than that of the plant model.
2.1 Adaptive Stabilization of LTI SISO Plants
Let LTI SISO plant be modeled in the input-output form as

Desired closed-loop system performance may be expressed in the form of a
certain \reference" differential equation. In the classical MRAC this equation
is explicitly implemented in the adaptive controller by the Reference Model,

cf. [20]. To describe the IRM adaptive controllers, let us introduce an adaptation
error signal  (t) as  (t) =G(p)y(t); where G(p) =p

is a
given Hurwitz polynomial in operator p  d=dt. Coe cients g

are the design
parameters; they are chosen based on the desired dynamics of the closed-loop
system. Degree l of polynomial G(p) is de ned below. Assuming that the
adaptation law ensures tendency (t) to zero let us notice that as   0 output
y(t) satis es the following \reference equation"
G(p)y(t) = 0; (2)
describing the reference model. This model is not implemented in the adaptive
controller in the form of a certain dynamical subsystem, but introduced implic-
itly via parametersg
i
(i = 0; 1;:::;l 1) [35]. Therefore it is called the Implicit
Reference Model (IRM).
Let us choose the feedback control law in the following form: u(t) =

with respect to transfer function GW (s) one may easily obtain the following
stability conditions of adaptive controller (3):

2. l=k 1, where k =n m is a relative degree of plant model (1).
Algorithm (3) usually ensures vanishing  (t) essentially faster than transients
in the closed-loop. As a result, changing controller (3) gains is stopped and
plant (1) output y(t) obeys the IRM (2).
To avoid unlimited growth of controller (3) gains in the presence of external
disturbances and measuring errors, the following ff-modi cation of (3) may be
used, see [2,17]:

2.2 Adaptive Tracking Systems with IRM
Adaptive control law (4) may be straightforwardly extended to solving the
tracking problem with the desired closed-loop system dynamics, see [2]. To this
end let us introduce reference signalr(t) and de ne adaptation error signal (t)
as
 (t) =G(p)y(t) D(p)r(t); (5)
whereG(p) is de ned above, and operator polynomialD(p) has the formD(p) =

. Signal (t) may be treated as the discrepancy in the equation
G(p)y(t) =D(p)r(t); (6)
considering (6) as the IRM for the case of tracking system.
By the analogy with (3) let us take the control action in the form

and its coe cients may be chosen arbitrarily by the designer.
2.3 Signal-Parametric Adaptive Controllers with IRM
Let the regulation goal lim

x(t) = 0 for plant
_ x(t) =Ax(t) +Bu(t); y(t) =Cx(t); (9)
where x(t)2R
n
, u(t)2R

, y(t)2R

, A, B, C are constant real matrices of
appropriate dimensions, be posed. Following [2,16] introduce an auxiliary goal
as ensuring the sliding mode motion along the prede ned surface (line in the
scalar control case), which is given by the equality (t)  0, where (t) =Gy(y),
G is a given (l n)-matrix. Let us use the following control law:
u = sign ;   =Gy; (10)
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 45Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2020
where  > 0 is a controller parameter. It may be proved that for system (9),
(10) the posed control goal may be achieved if there exist matrix P =P

follows from the passi cation theorem, the mentioned conditions are ful lled
iff: transfer functionGW (s) is HMP (whereW (s) =C

B); the sign
of GCB is known (we assume that it is positive). Under these conditions the
goal lim
t!1
x(t) = 0 is achieved for su ciently large  (with respect to the initial
conditions and actual plant parameters).
To avoid dependence of closed-loop system stability on initial conditions
and plant parameters, the following \signal-parametric" (\combined") control
law may be used instead of (10):
u =K
T
(t)y(t)  sign (y);  (y) =Gy(t)
_
K(t) =  (y) y(t); (11)
where   =  
T
> 0,  > 0 are the matrix and scalar adaptation gains (design
parameters).
For the case of scalar control input the following control law, inspired by [23,
28], may be used instead of (11):
u = k(t) (y) 
 
sign( (y))
q
 
 
 (y)
 
 
;  (y)=Gy;
_
k(t) =

: (12)
This law produces more smooth control action than the \relay" one.

algorithms for quadrotor. This technique will be used for translational motion.

3.2 Adaptive Control Laws for Quadrotor Attitude
Assuming that angular velocities !

are small, one may obtain the lin-
earized model of quadrotor angular motion in the vicinity of zero. In this model
the yaw motion may be considered separately of the roll and pitch motions and
modeled by the following equation:

to prevent in nitely increasing when measurements are noisy. This modi cation
is used for all control gains.
To cope with unmodelled actuator dynamics the shunt (parallel feedforward

for rigorous statements. The following controllers for other angles and positions
will be design by analogy with replacing signal (t) and other respective signals.

Linearized pitch (#) and roll () angular motion models may be written as
follows:   = I

The passi cation method can be used since systems (17) ful ll the nec-
essary HMP conditions. The following controllers are used for roll and pitch
stabilization as it was shown above for yaw angle (16).

3.3 Adaptive Control Laws for Quadrotor Altitude

presented in the following form

System (19) also satis es the HMR condition, so the same controller as (16)
may be used for altitude stabilization.
3.4 Adaptive Control Laws for Quadrotor Latitude and Longitude
Changing roll and pitch angles allows quadrotor to move along the horizontal
plane. Let us describe quadrotor dynamics along 0X and 0Z as an independent
motion from (13):

Above dynamics equations may be derived taking into account that rotation
on yaw angle are done before quadrotor moving in X0Z plane so = 0.
Let us use the following attitude controllers with pre-rotation on angle 
 
and coordinate system change:
(

(21)
where x
 
;z
 
are reference quadrotor position and k

 ;k
#
  are positive coe -
cients.
With control laws (21) and linearized in the origin model (13), equations
describing quadrotor motion in X0Z plane are as follows
(

where ^ z; ^ x are stabilization errors in new coordinate system and ^ z
 
; ^ x
 
are the
reference errors.
In is obviously that transfer function derived from (22) satis es to HMP
conditions with G =

tude and longitude positions.
4 Simulation Results
In the simulations, the model parameters was taken from [7] and some experi-
ments with attitude control based on mentioned above passi cation method was
described in [31]. Controllers coe cient was set the same for every simulation
run.
4.1 Stabilization
The most common quadrotor purpose is stabilization in the reference point.
Obviously, the reference point is linear position x;z;y and heading angle .
Roll and pitch angles are auxiliary to perform transversal motion in 3D space.
Let us take reference pointfx

time histories of latitude, longitude and altitude in the case of constant reference
signals. Attitude time histories are shown in Fig. 2.
Auxiliary signals generated by position controllers (21) are shown at  g. 2.
Roll and pitch adaptive controllers are performing tracking for generated auxil-
iary signals. Controller coe cients (including controller (15)) are tuning slightly
and fast. Altitude, latitude and longitude controllers coe cient are tuning more
substantially are shown in Fig. 3.
4.2 Tracking with noisy measurements
The most common case for quadrotor control is tracking the reference trajectory
that may be prede ned or manually set by the UAV operator. Let us de ne the
following reference trajectories: x
 
(t) = 8 sin 0:1t (m), z
 
(t) = 8 cos 0:1t (m),
y
 
(t) = 0:1t (m), 
 
(t) = 0:5 sint (rad). All the quadrotor sensors are noisy.
Moreover, global positioning are based on GPS with a su cient inaccuracy.
As it was mentioned above, supposed simple adaptive controllers are taking
into account noise measurements by using feedback in (15) and the following

IMU (with variance  
2
att
= 0:001, leads to a noisy attitude position) and into
GPS (with variance 
2
pos
= 0:1, leads to a noisy altitude, latitude and longitude
positions). This situation is close to real IMUs measures as it notised in [24].
Noisy measured signals are shown at  gs. 4 and 5 by grey lines.
Latitude and longitude reference signals are changing permanently and co-
e cients in positioning adaptive controllers are also tuning (see  g. 7).
As it could be seen, proposed simple adaptive controllers may be used for
quadrotors with noisy sensors and external disturbances.
5 Conclusion
Simple adaptive control technique based on the passi cation method and the
Implicit Reference Model approach is used for design of the adaptive controller
for every quadrotor position: attitude, altitude, latitude and longitude. The
simulation study has been preformed basing on previous experimental studies
and quadrotor mathematical models. The simulations demonstrate good perfor-
mance quality and high adaptation rate of the SAC system for every controlling
