Abstract
We have solved a nerve conduction equation in terms of hyperbolic functions
and found the restrictions on the coe cients of the governing equation and the
solution parameters for the kink-antikink solutions to exist.Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2000
1. Introduction
The governing equation for wave front propagation in non-uniform axon cables
is

The in nitesimal operators of the symmetry group of the partial differential
equation (1:1) have already been found [1, 2] using Sophus Lie's theory of
symmetry groups [3]. The equation (1.1) has a wide literature and applications
[4, 5, 6, 7].
The aim of this paper is to derive kink-antikink solutions of equation (1.1) with
r(x) = constant, using a direct method [4,5] using the properties of hyperbolic
functions. The method is to balance the highest nonlinear term and the deriva-
tive term for some combination of hyperbolic functions and then to equate the
like powers of the functions on both sides. For example, our solution will be of
the form
u(z) =
m

tanh

where the expansion coe cientfa

, order of expansion m, and wave number
  are to be determined. It is easy to note that a derivative term u
nz
of n
th
order
has highest power in tanh  z of m+n. Therefore, for equations in u possessing
a highest derivative term of order d and highest nonlinear term u
h
, we have,
m =

where q

are the constant depending on ff and P

(ff) is a polynom of
degree 3. If ff is a root of the polynom we get an equation of the form (2.1)
with q
0
= 0. So without losss of generality we can put q
0
= 0 in (2.1). We look
for travelling wave solutions of equation (2:1) in the form
u(z) = u(x  vt); (2:2)
where, v is the wave velocity.
Using (2:2) in (2:1) and rearranging the terms, we get

Equation (2:3) is an ordinary differential equation of second order involving
a third degree polynomial in u. Consistent with equation (1:4), we assume a
solution of (2:3) in the form
u(z) = a
0
+ a

tanh  z; (2:4)
where, a
0
; a

and   are parameters to be determined. Substituting (2:4) into
(2:3) and equating like powers of tanh  z on both sides, we get the following
equations:

Equation (2:8) gives a constraint equation involving the parameters a
0
; a

and
 . It is quite clear that solution in the form (2:4) is possible only when q
3
is
positive.
We set
q

so that

Since we are looking for kink-antikink solutions, we put a
1
= sa
0
, where s is a
real number. Using expressions (2:10) and (2:13), we get
a
0
=

: (2:15)
Since q
3
is always positive, we take the positive sign in (2:15) when q
2
is positive
and the negative sign when q
2
is negative. Therefore, for a
0
to be positive, q
2
should be less than
p
3q
3
when it is positive and q
2
should be greater than
 
p
3q
3
when it is negative. From (2:12) it follows that for a
0
to be positive, q
1
should be negative for a positive q
2
and q
1
should be positive for a negative q
2
.
With a
1
= sa
0
, our solution u(z) can be written in the form
u(z) = a
0
(1 + s tanh  z): (2:16)
Case 1. s > 0;   > 0
In this case, if a
0
is positive, a
1
will be positive and so   =
r
q

a

which
gives rise to a kink solution. If a

a

which leads to an anti-kink solution. These solutions are shown
in Fig.1 and Fig.4.

Case 2. s < 0;   > 0
Here, if a
0
is positive, a
1
has negative sign and so   =  
r
q
3
2
a
1
which is
the case of an anti-kink solution. If a

is negative, a
1
becomes positive and so
  =
r
q

2
a
1
which gives rise to a kink solution. These solutions are represented
by Fig.2 and Fig.3.
Case 3. s > 0;   < 0
In this case, if a
0
is positive, a
1
will be positive and so,   =  
r
q
3
2
a
1
which
leads to an anti-kink solution. If a
0
is negative, a
1
becomes negative and then
  =
r
q
3
2
a
1
which is the case of a kink solution. These solutions are again
shown in Fig.2 and Fig.3.
Case 4. s < 0;   < 0
Here, if a
0
is positive, a
1
will be negative and so,   =
r
q
3
2
a
1
which gives rise
to a kink solution. If a
0
is negative, a
1
becomes positive and   =  
r
q
3
2
a
1
which leads to an anti-kink solution. These solutions are again represented by
Fig.1 and Fig.4.
Thus when s and   have same signs, (2:16) is a kink solution when a
0
is positive,
that is, when q
1
< 0 for positive q
2
and q
1
> 0 for negative q
2
. (2:16) is an
anti-kink solution when a
0
is negative.
When s and   have opposite signs, (2:16) is a kink solution when a
0
is negative,
that is, when q
1
> 0 for positive q
2
and q
1
< 0 for negative q
2
. (2:16) is an
anti-kink solution for positive a
0
.
3. Conclusion
We have derived kink-antikink solutions of a nerve conduction equation explic-
itly in terms of hyperbolic functions. It is quite interesting to note that by
this direct method we could obtain certain conditions involving the constant
coe cients of the governing equation and the solution parameters for such so-
lutions to exist. We could  nd that for a solution in the form (2:16) to exist the

coe cients of the highest nonlinear term must be strictly positive and (2:12)
should be satis ed.
This is only a preliminary mathematical study of the nerve conduction equa-
tions. An investigation about the stability of the solutions and its biological
relevance will be done in the future. Solutions of these equations using other
methods and comparison of solutions is also a matter of future research.
