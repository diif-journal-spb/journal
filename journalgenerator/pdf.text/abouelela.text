Abstract
In this paper we study the stability of linear non-autonomous time-varying system with
multiple delays. Using the Lyapunov functionals method we  nd su cient conditions
for the exponential stability with a given convergence rate, in terms of linear matrix
inequalities or the solution of Riccati differential equations. The results are applied to
stabilization problem of linear non-autonomous time-varying control system with multiple
delays.
Keywords: Non-autonomous systems, Time-delay systems, Exponential sta-
bility, Lyapunov functional, Matrix inequalities, Riccati differential equations.

1 Introduction
Time-delay systems are frequently encountered in various areas, including
physical and chemical processes, biology, economics, engineering, control of the
growth of global economy, control of epidemics, etc.
The stability problem of linear time-delay systems has attracted a lot of
attention in the few past decades, for example, [1, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14], etc.

Stability criteria for linear time-delay systems can be divided into two cat-
egories, delay-independent stability criteria and delay-dependent stability cri-
teria, by whether the criteria include the information about delays or not. In
addition linear time-delay systems can be divided into two categories by the
number of delays. Single-delay systems which have only a single time-delay
constant, and multiple-delay systems which have at least two time-delay con-
stants.
Most of exciting results of stability were derived using different theories.
Some of the stability criteria are directly developed from the characteristic
equation and are characterized by the location of eigenvalues and determination
of measures and norms of matrices of the system. The main technique used
in the stability investigation relies on the using of the Lyapunov functionals
method, for example, [2, 16, 17, 18].
One of the extended stability properties is the concept of ff-stability, which
relates to the exponential stability with a convergence rateff> 0. The following
retarded system
_ x =f(t;x(t);x(t h)); t  0;
x(t) = (t); t2 [ h; 0];
is ff-stable with ff > 0, if there exists a function  (:) such that for each  (:),
the solution x(t; ) of the system satis es
kx(t; )k  (k k)e
 fft
; for all t  0;
wherek k = maxfk (t)k : t2 [ h; 0]g. This implies that forff> 0 the system
can be made exponentially stable with the convergence rate ff.
For time-varying systems, the investigation of the exponential stability was
treated in [3, 5, 8, 9, 16, 17], where stability conditions for time-varying systems
are derived in terms of the solution of a certain Riccati differential equation
RDE and linear matrix inequalities LMI.
This paper deals also with the exponential stability with convergence rate
of linear non-autonomous time-varying system with multiple delays, and then
apply the obtained results to control problems. By using Lyapunov functionals
method we show that the existence of the solution of certain RDE or of some
LMI guarantees the exponential stability with a given convergence rate of linear
non-autonomous time-varying delay systems, and how the results can be applied
to obtain su cient conditions for the stabilizability with a given convergence
rate of a class of linear non-autonomous time-varying control delay systems.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 the problem is stated and the
required notation, de nitions and auxiliary proposition are formulated. Section
3 presents the main results for the exponential stability problem with a con-
vergence rate of a linear non-autonomous multiple time-varying delays system.
Section 4 devotes to apply the obtained results to the stabilization problem.
The paper ends with conclusion and cited references.

solution of Riccati differential equations is given in the following proposition.

Then the system (2:1) is ff-stable.
Thus the proof of Theorem 3.2 is now complete.

Thus, by Theorem 3.1, the system is 1-stable.
4 Application to control problem
We apply the above results to the strong stabilizability problem of the follow-
ing linear non-autonomous multiple time-varying delays system with control
problem
_ x(t) =A
0
(t)x(t) +
m
X
i=1

(t)x(t h
i
(t)) +B(t)u(t); t2R

is the state vector; u(t)2 R
r
is the control, A

(t);A
i
(t)2
M
n n
;i = 1; 2;:::;m and B(t)2 M
n r
are given matrix functions continuous
onR
+
.
Strong stabilizability means that for every given number ff > 0, there exists
a delay-free feedback control u(t) = K(t)x(t), K(t)2 M
r n
such that the
closed-loop system
_ x(t) = [A

(t) +B(t)K(t)]x(t) +
m
X
i=1
A

(t)x(t h

(t));
is exponentialy stable with the rate convergence ff.
Recently the stabilization problem has been studied by using Lyapunov func-
tionals method, for example, [2; 3], etc.
As a direct consequence of Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.2 we obtain the
following su cient conditions for the strong stabilizability in terms of Linear
matrix inequality and the solution of Riccati differential equation.
Theorem 4.1. Linear non-autonomous time-varying control system with mul-
tiple delays (4:1) is ff-stabilizable, if there exists a symmetric matrix function
P (t)> 0 satisfying the following Riccati differential equation

Moreover the feedback control is determined by

where P (t) is the solution of Riccati differential equation (4:2).
Proof. Let us make a variable transformation

Under the feedback controlu(t) =K(t)x(t), whereK(t) =

implies that system (4:1) is ff-stabilizable.

5 Conclusion
In this paper we have presented su cient conditions for the ff-stable (expo-
nential stability with a given rate ff) of a class of linear non-autonomous time-
varying system with multiple delays. The conditions are derived in terms of the
solution of Riccati differential equation or of linear matrix inequality. The re-
sults are applied to obtain ff-stabilizable conditions for linear non-autonomous
time-varying control system with multiple delays.
