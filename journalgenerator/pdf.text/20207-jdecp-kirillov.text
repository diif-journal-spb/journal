Abstract. The mathematical model of sector capital distribution dynamics
over e ciency levels with the depreciation is proposed. The qualitative analysis
of the model is presented. The globally stable set (attractor) is constructed.
The equilibria of the proposed dynamical model are determined, in the case of
two e ciency levels the global stability of one of them is proved. It is shown
that the global stability of the equilibrium means that the depreciation process
causes excess production. It is proved that in the case of three e ciency levels
there exists a unique equilibrium. In the case without the capital migrating
from the second level to the  rst one the global stability of the equilibrium is
proved.
Keywords: dynamical systems, Schumpeterian dynamics, global stability.
1 Introduction
The Austrian economist J. Schumpeter proposed the theory of endogenous eco-
nomic development [1] based on two interacting processes: innovations (the
creation of new technologies) and imitations (their borrowing). This theory is
actively developed currently (for example, see [4, 5, 6, 11], etc.).Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 2, 2020
The mathematical model of the Schumpeterian dynamics with depreciation,
under the action of which the  rms transfer to the lower e ciency level, was
proposed by V. M. Polterovich and G. M. Henkin [13]. Their evolution equation
describing the dynamics of the  rms distribution over e ciency levels is as
follows

where,F
i
(t) is the share of  rms corresponding to the levels which numbers are
less or equal to i at the moment of time t, N is the initial number of levels for
t = 0. Note that the addend ff(F
i

) describes the innovation process,
the addend  (1 F
i
)(F
i
 F
i 1
) | the imitation process and the addend
 ((F
i+1
(t) F
i
(t)) | the depreciation process. Here, ff > 0 is the innovation
rate,   > 0 is the imitation rate,  > 0 is the depreciation rate. The numerical
analysis of this model was conducted in [14]. However, the qualitative analysis
of the models with depreciation was not presented in the investigations and
this problem was formulated in [14]. Note that in [13] for the model without
the depreciation (  = 0) the wave process, generated by the above system of
ordinary differential equations, were studied.
A. A. Shananin and G. M. Henkin described the mathematical model of
the  rm capacity dynamics in their article [12]. Let M
i
(t) be the integrated
 rm capacity at thei-th level, 
i
is the pro t per capacity unit at thei-th level,
'
i
(t) is the share of the investments of the  rms at thei-th level for the creation
of the capacities at the next i + 1-th level, 0 6 '

t!1. It means the unbounded growth of the capacities, which is incorrect
from the economic perspective.
The authors, developing the described models, propose the model of the
capital distribution dynamics over e ciency levels with depreciation taking into
account the boundedness of the economic growth. It is modeled via the intro-
ducing of the notion of the economic niche volume which is analogous to the
ecological niche volume. The economic niche volume is a limit integrated cap-
ital value, for which the growth rate is so low that there is no capital growth.
Thus, in this paper the partial solution of the problem formulated in [14] is
proposed under the boundedness of the economic growth condition.
2 The model with the depreciation
Consider the economic system (for example, sector) in which the  rms are or-
dered by e ciency levels. Leti be the number of e ciency level,i2f1;:::;Ng.
Assume that the greateri corresponds to the higher level. Consider the follow-
ing system of differential equations

So, inner product (f;n

@E(d;r). Hence, the positive half-trajectories intersect @E(d;r) from outside
to inside. Therefore, all positive half-trajectories enter each E(d;r) and do not
leave it. Taking into account that d;r may be arbitrary small, we obtain the
result: C(t;C

Thus, the maximal excess production occures if   = 1, and if   = 0, there is
no excess production in the long run. Thus, large depreciation inuences the
economy negatively by causing the excess production.

It is possible if and only if the polynomial (16) has the unique real root y

and the other roots, y

, y

, are either negative real or complex-conjugate.
Since in our framework y =
C

C

must be positive real then there exists only
the root y

> 0 of (16) is feasible. Therefore, the system (15) has a unique
solution, which means that the system (14) has a unique equilibrium C
 
such
that C

However, we can only prove the existence and the uniqueness of the equi-
libriumC
 
, but we cannot  nd this equilibrium in the explicit form in general.
Let us consider the case

ine cient or obsolete that the  rms at the second level under the action of the

Hence, the !-limit set

From (17), it is easily to understand, that in W : C

for any positive half-trajectory. Hence, C

= 0 for any point belonging to

the contrary, that there exists a positive half-trajectory r
 
(C

exists an !-limit point Q2

and Q6=P .
SinceR

has the following form

Thus, we can assume that the system (17) has the form (18). One can see, that
the system (18) and the system (3) have the same form. Hence, all conclusions
obtained in the Section 3 are valid for the system (18). From the Theorem 1 the
equilibrium C

of this system is globally stable inR

entering the cylinderZ. But the positive half-trajectories cannot leave W . We
have reached a contradiction. Thus, Q is not a !-limit point of this positive
half-trajectory. Thus we have,

Conclusions
In this article, the mathematical model of sector capital distribution dynamics
with the depreciation are proposed. The qualitative analysis of the model is
presented. The global attractor for the case of the arbitrary number of e ciency
levels is established. The equilibria of the constructed dynamical model are
determined in the case of two e ciency levels, their global stability is proved.
The global stability of the equilibrium C
 
= (C
 
1
;C
 
2
) such that C
 
1
+C
 
2
> V
means that the depreciation process causes excess production. It is proved that
in the case of three e ciency levels there exists a unique equilibrium. In the
case without the capital transferring from the second level to the  rst level the
global stability of the equilibrium is proved.
