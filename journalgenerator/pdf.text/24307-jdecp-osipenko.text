Abstract. A discrete dynamic system generated by a diffeomorphism is considered. The task of 
constructing an invariant decomposition of the tangent space is set. This task is reduced to 
calculating the components of a chain recurrent set on a projective bundle. A computer-oriented 
tool for such a calculation is a symbolic image of a dynamic system, which is an oriented graph. 
The components of the chain recurrent set are determined by calculating the components of the 
strong connectivity of the symbolic image. A nontrivial example of calculating the desired tangent 
space decomposition is given. 
 
Keywords: discrete dynamic system, tangent space, invariant decomposition, chain recurrent 
trajectories, limit sets, projective space, symbolic image, localization algorithm.  
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Consider a discrete dynamic system 
 
      +1
=   (      )                                                                                                             (1) 
 
generated by a diffeomorphism    :   →    of a compact manifold. The differential      is a linear 
map, which in local coordinates is a partial differential matrix or the Jacobi matrix

     (   )= (
         (   )
         ). 
 
The differential acts from the tangent space at a point    to the tangent space at a point    (   ) 
 
     (   ):         →          (   )
. 
 
The differential defines the linear expansion of a discrete system 
 
      +1
=   (      )         
      +1
=     (      )      ,
                                      
 
where       is a vector in the tangent space          . Often, in practical research, the problem arises of the 
existence of the decomposition of the tangent space, invariant for the differential.  
Example 1. If    is a fixed point, i.e.    (   )=   , then the following decomposition takes place: 
         =   1
⨁ ...⨁       , where each       is invariant for the matrix  
 
     (   )=(
         (   )
         ).  
 
Example 2. Hyperbolicity of an invariant set    ⊂    is generated by the existence of invariant sub 
bundles       и        of the tangent space      |
   
,  such that 
 
     |
   
=      ⨁       ,  
 
where the invariance of the sub bundle E
∗
 means equality 
 
     (   )   ∗
(   )=   ∗
(   (   )). 
 
In this case, the differential exponentially compresses under positive iterations on       and under 
negative iterations on       .  
Example 3. It is known [2, 14], that if the tangent bundle splits into two sub bundles    1
 and    2
, 
which are exponentially separated by the system (1), then the following invariant decomposition 
takes place: 
 
     =   1
⨁    2
. 
 
The given examples show, that the problem of the existence of an invariant decomposition of the 
tangent space is quite actual. 
Problem statement: to find computer-oriented methods for constructing of an invariant 
decomposition of a tangent space into a direct sum 
  
     =   1
⨁ ...⨁      . 
 
1.1. A projective space 
 
Any non-degenerate linear mapping    :      →       can be represented as: 
 
     =|     | 
    
|     |
=   |     | 
    
|     |
=   |     |       (   ), Differential equations and control processes, N. 3, 2024 
 
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2024.307        Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru      110 
 
where    =|   |, |   |≠ 0,    =
   |   |
⁄
∈       −1
,       −1
− a unit sphere. Thus, the linear mapping 
   :   →      is a composition of two mappings 
 
   →       (   )=
    
|     |
               →   |     |, 
 
where the first mapping acts on the sphere        −1
, while the second one acts on a positive half-line 
    +
. The projective space        −1
 can be obtained by identifying diametrically opposite points of the 
sphere        −1
. Symmetry of the display       (   ) regarding the sign change       (±   )=±       (   ) allows 
us to define the mapping      (   )=     /|     | on a projective space        −1
, identifying diametrically 
opposite points on the sphere. For points of the space        −1
 we will keep the designation    , i. e.    
denotes a one-dimensional subspace and (or) a unit vector on it, which does not lead to 
misunderstandings. 
Thus, we obtain the mapping  
     (   ,   )=(   (   ),
     (   )   |     (   )   |
) 
 
on the projective bundle    ={(   ,   ):     ∈    ,    ∈        −1
(   )}, which generates a discrete dynamic 
system of the form 
 
      +1
=   (      ),                                                                                                                  (2) 
 
      +1
 =
     (      )      |     (      )      |
                                                                                                       (3) 
 
on the projective bundle    . A positive number    (   ,   )=|     (   )   | is a coefficient of length change 
in the subspace    under the action of a differential at the point    . The projective bundle    is a 
compact manifold with a metric [14, pp. 531-539], which can be interpreted as the sum of the 
distance on the manifold    and the angle between the subspaces.  
 
1.2. Chain recurrent trajectories 
 
A sequence {      } appears to be an    -trajectory, if  
 
       +1
=   (      )+       , |       |<    . 
 
Let an    -trajectory {      } be a periodic one, i. e. there is    >0, such as       +   =      for every    . Then 
points       are called the    -periodic ones.  
Definition 1. A point    is called the chain recurrent point, if it is    -periodic for every    >0; that 
mean, a periodic ε-trajectory exists passing through the point x. 
A chain recurrent set consists of all chain recurrent points and is denoted by      . The chain 
recurrent set      is invariant, closed and contains all types of return trajectories: periodic, almost-
periodic, non-wandering, homoclinic, etc. Note, that if the chain recurrent point is not periodic and 
          >1, then there is an arbitrarily small perturbation    under    0
-topology, for which this point 
is the periodic one [27]. We can say, that chain recurrent points generate periodic trajectories under 
   0
- perturbations. Therefore, in computer calculations, chain recurrent points will look like periodic 
ones. Differential equations and control processes, N. 3, 2024 
 
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2024.307        Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru      111 
Definition 2. Two chain recurrent points we call equivalent, if they can be connected by a periodic 
   -trajectory for any    >0. A chain recurrent set is divided into equivalence classes {     }, which we 
call the components of a chain recurrent set. 
Let us recall, that the    -limit set of the trajectory is the limit set of points of the trajectory under the 
condition that    → −∞, while the    -limit set of the trajectory is the limit set of trajectory points at 
   →+∞. If the trajectory is not a chain recurrent one, then its    -limit set lies in some component 
Ω
1
 of a chain recurrent set, and its    -limit set lies in another component Ω
2
. We can say that the 
trajectory starts at Ω
1
 and ends in Ω
2
. If we fix the neighborhood U of a chain recurrent set, then 
there exists a number Т>0, such that any trajectory remains outside U no longer than during a time 
period Т. 
The theoretical basis of the proposed computer-oriented method gives the following theorem. 
Theorem 1 [2, p. 117; 14, p. 152-153; 26]. Let       +1
=   (      )− be a smooth system on a compact 
manifold    ,    be a component of a chain recurrent set of this system, and    ∶      →    be a 
projection from a tangent space onto the manifold.  
Then  
1) the chain recurrent set of the reduction of the projective mapping  
 
     (   ,   )=(   (   ),
     (   )   |     (   )   |
) 
 
on    |
   has    of components    1
,...,     , 1≤    ≤          , 
2) every set       defines the (continuous, having constant dimension) subspace       ⊂     over    
having the form 
 
      ={   ∈    −1
(   ):    ≠ 0  ⇒
   |   |
=   ∈       },  
 
3) the decomposition takes place 
 
     |
   =   1
⨁ ...⨁      , 
 
which is invariant for the differential      , 
4) each chain recurrent component    ∗
 on the bundle    |
   has the properties described in the point 
2. 
The decomposition described in this theorem is called the fine Morse decomposition of the tangent 
bundle. Thus, in order to find an invariant decomposition of the tangent space      |
   =
   1
⨁ ...⨁       , it is enough to find all the components of a chain recurrent set of the mapping  
 
     (   ,   )=(   (   ),
     (   )   |     (   )   |
) 
 
on the projective bundle.

A projective space 
1
 
d
P

 is a set of straight lines passing through the origin of the coordinates in       . 
It can be obtained by identifying of diametrically opposite points of the unit sphere 
1
 
d
S

. The 
following coordinates can be entered in the projective space. Let (   1
,   2
,…,      ) be the coordinates 
in       . A straight line passing through the origin and a non-zero vector    =(   1
,   2
,…,      ) look like 
 
   ={   (   1
,   2
,…,      ),    ∈   }. 
 
Let us find the coordinate       , which implements max{|   1
|,|   2
|,…,|      |} for the vector    ≠0. Then 
      ≠0, and the point    (   1
,   2
,…,      ) lies on a straight line    when    =
1
      . This point has 
coordinates (   1
,…,      ,…,      ) , where       =
            ,       =1,        |     |≤1 for ≠   . A set of numbers 
(   1
,…,      −1
,      −1
,…,      ) defines the coordinates of a one-dimensional subspace    ⊂      in the 
projective space. At the same time, the vector    =(   1
,…,      −1
,1,      −1
,…,      ) is situated in the 
subspace    ⊂      , and coordinates (   1
,…,      −1
,      −1
,…,      )   belong to the (d-1)-dimensional 
cube       =[−1,1]
   −1
. A set of coordinates (   1
,…,      −1
,      −1
,…,      ) we will call a map with the 
number k of the projective space

d
P

. If we iterate through all the values for k=1, …, d, we obtain 
d maps, which cover the 
1
 
d
P

. In order to obtain the projective space, it is necessary to identify 
(glue) the boundary points of the described cubes. For example, a one-dimensional subspace 
   ={   (1,…,1),    ∈   } has coordinates (1,…,1) in all maps, therefore, all maps must be glued 
together at these points. 
A non-degenerative mapping (a matrix) A:       →      displays a one-dimensional subspace into a 
one-dimensional subspace and, therefore, defines a mapping in the projective space 
1
 
d
P

. Let's 
consider how this mapping is defined on the maps of projective space described above. Let the 
vector    =(   1
,   2
,…,      ) ,      =(   1
,   2
,…,      ), and subspace    ={      ,    ∈   } is defined by 
coordinates (   1
,…,      −1
,      −1
,…,      ) on the map number k. Under the action of a non-
degenerative mapping А, the subspace    is being converted into a one-dimensional subspace 
     ={   (   1
,   2
,…,      ),    ∈   }. To determine the number of the subspace map for      we find the 
coordinate       which implements max{|   1
|,|   2
|,…,|      |}≠0. The number m defines the map, 
where the coordinates of the subspace      look like (   1
,…,      −1
,      +1
,…,      ), where       =      /      . 
Thus, the subspace    has coordinates (   1
,…,      −1
,      −1
,…,      ) on the map number k, while its 
image      has coordinates (   1
,…,      −1
,      +1
,…,      ) on the map number m. 
 
2.2. A symbolic image of a dynamic system [4, 5, 6] 
 
Let    :   →    be a homeomorphism of a compact manifold M, which generates a discrete dynamic 
system 
 
      +1
=   (      ),                                                      
  
and    (   ,   )− a distance at M. A tool for localization of a chain recurrent set is the symbolic image 
of a dynamic system. The concept of a symbolic image of a dynamic system [20] combines 
symbolic dynamics [1, 18] and numerical methods [16].

Fig. 1. Construction of a symbolic image 
 
Let    ={   (1),...,   (   )} be a finite covering of the manifold    with closed subsets; the set    (  ) 
we will call the cell with the index i, see fig. 1. A symbolic image of a dynamic system for the 
covering    is an oriented graph G with vertices {  }, corresponding to cells {   (  )}. Vertices i and j 
connected by an oriented edge (arc)    →    if and only if 
 
   (   (  ))⋂   (   )≠∅. 
 
A symbolic image is a geometric mean for discretizing a dynamic system. The study of the 
symbolic image allows us to obtain useful information about the global structure of the dynamics of 
the system. The symbolic image depends on the covering    , the change of which changes the 
symbolic image. 
The presence of an edge    →    guarantees the existence of such a point    inside the cell    (  ) , 
whose image    (   ) belongs to the cell    (  ) . In other words, the edge    →    is a trace of the display 
    →    (   ) , where    ∈    (  ),    (   )∈    (  ). If an edge    →    does not exist, there are no points 
   ∈    (  ) , whose images    (   )∈    (  ) . We do not impose restrictions on the covering    , but 
without limiting generality, we can assume that the cells    (  ) are polyhedral that intersect along the 
boundary disks. In practical calculations     is a compact area in ℝ
   , and the cells    (  ) are cubes or 
parallelepipeds. 
E. Petrenko in his dissertation [10] considered five ways to numerically construct a symbolic image. 
First of all, it should be noted that the numerical construction of a symbolic image is an 
approximate calculation, since the image of the cell is calculated approximately. The following 
simple method of numerically constructing a symbolic image gives good results. Let the covering  
   consist of polyhedra. A certain number of points {      ,    =1,2,⋯ ,   }, which are called the scan-
points, are evenly distributed in each cell    (  ) . The number of scan-points N sets an accuracy of 
calculating of the cell image. Usually, for smooth systems, the number of scan-points 10≤   ≤
100 is quite sufficient. Images    (      ) are calculated. Further, the arc    →    is considered to exist, if 
there is a scan-point       ∈    (  ), for which    (      )∈    (  ). Therefore, each arc    →    of the 
symbolic image is being implemented on the manifold by a pair of points       →    (     ) , where 
      ∈   (  ),    (      )∈    (   ).  
Fixing for each arc    →    the described pair       →    (      ), we will get a projection of a symbolic 
image on a manifold. At the same time, if there is a valid path on the symbolic image    =
(      ,    ∈   ), then each arc       →      +1
 defines the scan-point       ∈   (      ) ,    (      )∈    (      +1
), 
and the distance    (   (      ),      +1
) does not exceed the diameter of the cell    (      +1
) . Thus, the 
sequence of constructed points {      ,    ∈   } is an    -trajectory, where    is a maximum cell diameter 
for the covering    . In this case, we will say that the pseudo-trajectory {      ,    ∈   } is a trace of the 
path    . Differential equations and control processes, N. 3, 2024

There is a natural multi-valued mapping ℎ:   →       from the set    onto the set of vertices of the 
symbolic image, which is matching to a point    a set of vertices   , such as     ∈    (  ) : 
 
ℎ(   )={  :    ∈   (  )}. 
 
It follows from the definition of a symbolic image, that the diagram  
 
      →    ↓ℎ ↓ℎ
          →           
 
is commutative in the following sense: 
 
ℎ(   (   ))⊂    (ℎ(   )). 
                                                     
We cannot guarantee equality ℎ(   (   ))=   (ℎ(   )). However, the described inclusion is sufficient to 
display the trajectories of the system into acceptable paths of the symbolic image via the mapping 
ℎ.  
Example 4. Consider a geometric example of constructing a symbolic image. Let M be a closed 
area on the plane shown in the Fig. 1. The covering    consists of 100 squares, the numbering of 
which begins with the upper-left square, goes from left to right and from top to bottom, so that the 
upper left cell has the index (number) 1, while the index 10 corresponds to the upper right cell, 91 is 
the number of the lower left cell, and 100 is the index of the bottom right cell. Consider the cell 
   (  ) with the index i=63, let the image    (   (  )) intersect cells with numbers l=26, k=27, j=
28, l=36, d=37, see fig. 1. As the result, we have 5 arcs radiating from the vertex i to vertices 
j, k, l, e, d. By doing a similar construction for each cell, we will get a symbolic image. If the image 
   (   (  )) intersects the cell    (  ), then the loop    →    is formed.  
In this case, the following problem arises. Numbering of cells    (  ) is arbitrary. If the scan-point 
image    (     ) is calculated, the task appears of calculating of the number for that cell    (   ), which 
considers    (     ) . In other words, we need to know, how to use coordinates of a point to find out the 
number of the cell in which this point lies. Consider the example shown in Fig. 1. Let the area be a 
rectangle    =[   0
,   1
]×[   0
,   1
], the covering consists of squares with a side ℎ, the numbering of 
which starts from the upper left square, goes from left to right and from top to bottom. If a point on 
the plane has coordinates (x,y) , then the number   : (x,y)∈M(j) calculated by the formula  
 
   =[
|   1
−   |
ℎ
]   +[
|   0
−   |
ℎ
]+1, 
 
where [∙]− the integer part of the number,    – the number of cells in one row, so    =

−   0

2.3. Parameters of the symbolic image 
 
Let 
 
            (  )=       (   (   ,   ):   ,        (  ))

number d we call the diameter of the covering    . Let q be the largest diameter of the cell images

Since there is a modulus of continuity    (   ) for the display f, then an estimate takes place 
 
   ≤   (   ). 
 
Let's define the number r as follows. By construction, all cells are closed. If the cell and the image 
do not intersect:    (   )∩    (   (  ))=∅, then the distance between them 
 
       
=   (   (   (  )),   (   ))=min{   (   ,   ):   ∈    (   (  )),   ∈    (   )} 
 
is positive. Since the number of pairs (  ,   ) described above is finite, then the value 
 
   =min{        
:     (   )∩    (   (  ))=∅} 
 
is the positive one. Thus, r is the smallest distance between the images    (   (  )) and the cells    (   ) , 
that do not intersect. 
Let    be a symbolic image relative to the covering    , and    be the diameter of the covering    .  
Definition 3. The vertex of a symbolic image is called a recurrent vertex, if a periodic path passes 
through it. The set of recurrent vertices is denoted by RV. Two recurrent vertices    and    are called 
equivalent if there is a periodic path passing through    and    . 
Thus, the set of recurrent vertices      is divided into equivalence classes {      }. In graph theory, 
classes of equivalent recurrent vertices       are called components of strong connectivity. There are 
algorithms for constructing components of strong connectivity based on traversing the graph in 
depth [3, 12]. Robert Tarjan's algorithm is the most popular [28, 29]. This algorithm (written in 
codes) can be found on the Internet. 
 
2.4. The neighborhood of a chain recurrent set 
 
We will apply the process of sub-splitting of coverings and build a sequence of symbolic images. 
Let's consider the main step of the subdividing process. 
Let    ={   (  )} – be a covering and    – be a symbolic image for    . Suppose that the new      
covering is a subdivision of the    covering. This means that each cell    (  ) is subdivided into cells 
   (  ,   ),      =1,2,… , i.e. 
 
⋃   (  ,   )
   =   (  ). 
 
Let's denote by      a symbolic image for the covering      ={   (  ,   )}. The vertices of      are 
denoted as (     ) . Such a construction generates a mapping    from      onto    , which displays the 
vertices (  ,   ) onto the vertex    . Since the intersection of the image    (   (  ,   )) and    (  ,  ) : 
  
   (   (  ,   ))⋂   (  ,  ) ≠∅ 
 
for small cells, it guarantees a similar intersection for large cells    (   (  )) and    (  ) :  
 
   (   (  ))⋂    (   )≠∅.

This means that the mapping    transforms the arc (  ,   )→ (  ,  ) into the ark    →    . Hence,    maps 
the oriented graph      to the oriented graph    . Since the mapping    is a mapping of oriented 
graphs, each valid path on      is transformed by the mapping    to some valid path on    . In 
particular, the image of a periodic path is a periodic path, and the image of a recurrent vertex is a 
recurrent vertex. Moreover, the image of the class      of equivalent recurrent vertices (on      ) lies 
in the class    of equivalent recurrent vertices on    . 
Multi-valued mapping of ℎ:   →    maps to point    all vertices    such that    ∈   (  ) . 
  
Proposition [8]. The ℎ mapping has the following properties. 
1) If    is a chain recurrent point and    ∈ ℎ(   ) , then    is a recurrent vertex. 
2) If    1
 and    2
 lie in the same component of a chain recurrent set Ω,    1
∈ ℎ(   1
)           2
∈ ℎ(   2
) , 
then    1
 and    2
 are equivalent recurrent vertices. 
3) If Ω is a component of a chain recurrent set, then there is a single class    (   ) of equivalent 
recurrent vertices such that ℎ(   )⊂    (   ) . 
Let Ω be a component of a chain recurrent set. It follows from statement 7 that the image of ℎ(   ) 
lies in a certain class of equivalent recurrent vertices, which we will denote as    (   ); in this case, 
the component Ω lies in {⋃    (  )∶     ∈    (   )}. Note that the class    (   ) is uniquely determined by 
Ω. 
Let's denote as    (   ) the union of cells    (  ) , for which the vertex    is a recurrent vertex, i.e. 
 
   (   )={⋃   (  )∶    −                                     }.                                                                                       (4) 
 
Theorem 2 [6, 20].  
1) The set    (   ) is a closed neighborhood of a chain recurrent set      
 
     ⊂    (   ).                                                                                                                                                         (5) 
 
2) For any neighborhood    of a chain recurrent set      , there is d>0 such that  
 
     ⊂   (   )⊂    .                                                                                                                                                (6) 
 
3) The chain recurrent set      coincides with the intersection of the sets    (   ) for all positive d:  
 
     =⋂   (   )
   >0
.  
    
 
3. The localization process 
  
Suppose that    =   0
 is the initial covering, and    1
,   2
,⋯,−  were obtained by the described above 
subdividing process, the sets    0
,   1
,   2
,⋯,− were constructed according to (4). 
Theorem 3 [8]. The sequence of sets    0
,   1
,   2
,⋯,− has the following properties.  
1.       nested inside each other: 
 
   0
⊃   1
⊃     2
⊃ …⊃      .

          →∞
      =⋂         =     
 
is a chain recurrent set. 
 
3.1. The localization algorithm 
  
Based on the results obtained, we construct the following algorithm for localization of a chain 
recurrent set. 
1) Select the initial covering С for the compact    . We find the symbolic image    of the mapping    . 
Note that the cells of the initial covering can have an arbitrary diameter    0
. 
2) We select the recurrent vertices {  } on the graph    . Using them, we find a closed neighborhood 
   ={⋃    (  ):    −                                      } of a chain recurrent set      . 
3) Cells {   (  )}, corresponding to non-recurrent vertices {   }, are being removed from consideration.  
4) Cells    (  ) , corresponding to recurrent vertices {  }, are being divided into small cells with 
diameter several times smaller than before. Thus, we determine the new covering. 
5) We build a symbolic image    for the new covering.  
6) Move on to the point 2. 
Repeating the process of sequential grinding of the covering, according to theorem 3, we obtain a 
sequence of nested neighborhoods    0
,   1
,   2
,⋯,  of the chain recurrent set      , and a sequence of the 
largest diameters    0
,   1
,   2
,⋯,  of cells corresponding to the recurrent vertices of the symbolic 
image for the covering       . According to the construction,       +1
≤         , 0<   <1, and, therefore, 
the covering diameter converges to zero. Thus, the described algorithm gives a monotonically 
decreasing sequence of neighborhoods converging to a chain recurrent set. The proposed 
localization method works equally well with both stable and unstable chain recurrent trajectories, 
since it is based on the principle of returnability of a pseudo-trajectory. 
 
3.2. The localization of a chain recurrent set of the Van der Pol differential equation 
 
Example 5. The Van der Pol oscillator serves as a model of a triode tube generator in the case of a 
nonlinear lamp characteristic [30]. The equation has the form  
 
   ̈−1.5   ̇(1−   2
)+   =0. 
 
Turning to a two-dimensional system, we obtain an autonomous system of differential equations 
 
   ̇ =   ,                              
   ̇ =1.5   ̇(1−   2
)−   .

Fig. 2. Localization of the chain recurrent set of the Van der Pol equation  
 
 
To construct a discrete system, we define Ф(   ,   ) as the mapping of the shift per unit of time along 
the trajectories of this system by the numerical Runge-Kutta method. We consider the discrete 
dynamic system 
 
(      +1
,      +1
)=Ф(      ,      ). 
 
Using the method described above, we find the chain recurrent set of the resulting system. It is 
known, that this Van der Pol equation has an unstable equilibrium state (0,0) and a stable periodic 
trajectory. There are no other chain recurrent trajectories. The figure shows the sequential 
construction of the sets       ,    =1,2,3,4,5,6. It is clear that    6
 is a fairly small neighborhood of a 
chain recurrent set. 
 
3.3. The localization of a chain recurrent set in a projective space 
 
Let's consider an example of the localization of a chain recurrent set of a dynamic system generated 
by the action of the matrix 
 
   =(
0.8 −0.6 0
0.6 0.8 0
1 2 5
)                                                                                                 (7) 
 
in the projective space    2
; this action is denoted by    ∗
:   2
→   2
. Let    :   3
→   2
 be a projection 
from Euclidean space    3
 on a projective space    2
. The projective space    2
 on the maps described 
above is given by three squares [−1,1]
2
, glued along the boundary. To construct a symbolic image 
of this system, we set the initial covering    0
, which coincides with three given squares covering the 
projective space    2
. We will divide each square into 4 equal parts with further sub-divisions. 
Applying the localization algorithm described above, we obtain a chain recurrent set of a dynamic 
system. The structure of a chain recurrent set depends on the eigenvalues of the matrix A, which has 
one real number and a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues.

Fig. 3. The chain recurrent set of the action of the mapping    ∗
:   2
→   2
 
 
For example, if the vector    is an eigenvector for the real number    , then the eigenspace    =
{      ,    ∈   } is a fixed point for the mapping    ∗
:   2
→   2
, therefore,    ∗
(      )=      , and       is a 
chain recurrent point for    ∗
. M.V. Poryvai (4th year student of the Sevastopol branch of Moscow 
State University, 2022) implemented the described research. The resulting chain recurrent set is 
shown in the Fig. 3. It consists of a fixed point (0,0) in the third square– Oxy when z = 1 and two 
segments in the first square – Oyz when x = 1, and the second square – Oxz when y = 1. The maps 
are glued together at the boundary points. We show that the segments of the first and second 
squares are glued into a circle       . Indeed, the left end of the first segment (when x = 1) has 
coordinates (−1,   ) , which corresponds to the vector    1
=(1,−1,   ) in    3
. The left end of the 
second segment (when y = 1) has coordinates (−1,−   ) , which corresponds to the vector    2
=
(−1,1,−   ) in    3
. Since    1
=−   2
, then these vectors lie in the same subspace in    3
 and, therefore, 
the left end of the first segment is identified with the left end of the second segment in    2
. 
Similarly, the right end of the first segment (when x = 1) and the right end of the second segment 
(when y = 1) correspond to the vector (1,1,−   ) in    3
 and have to be identified in    2
. The 
resulting circle in    2
 corresponds to the proper two-dimensional subspace П (of the matrix А) for a 
pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues. The matrix А on П rotates by a fixed angle, so the entire 
circle       is filled with chain recurrent points. 
 
3.4. The localization of a chain recurrent set in a projective bundle over a two-
dimensional manifold 
 
As the example, we consider a discrete system generated by the Ikeda mapping 
 
(
      +1
      +1
)=(
   +   (             (      )−             (      ))
   (             (      )+             (      ))
) =(
      ),                      (8) 
 
where 
 
       = 0.4−

1+      2
+      2
,    =2,    =−0.9,    =0.9.  
 
This system was studied in the book [20]. System (8) in the domain    =[−2,4]   [−3,2] has a 
chain recurrent attractor A shown in the Fig. 4.  
 Differential equations and control processes, N. 3, 2024 
 
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2024.307        Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru      120 
 
 
Fig. 4. The chain recurrent set of the system (8) in the domain    
 
The motionless point    (1.3815,−2.4746) is hyperbolic and the attractor А is the closure of an 
unstable manifold of this point. The differential of the system does not have an invariant 
(nontrivial) decomposition over the attractor А, since the stable and unstable manifolds of the point 
   have a homoclinic tangent point.  
However, if we limit the domain of study to [−1.1,3.4]x[−1.5,1.8]=   0
, then the hyperbolic 
point    will not enter this region and the chain recurrent set (in the domain    0
) splits into two 
components Ω
1 
 and Ω
2 
. The component Ω
1 
 is a 6-periodic trajectory, but Ω
2 
is a Cantor set and 
has a nontrivial fractal structure. To localize the chain recurrent set of the differential action in the 
projective bundle, the Jacobi matrix is calculated  
 
   (   ,   )=(
    
    
    
          
    
    
    
). 
 
A projective bundle over the plane    2
 is a composition    2
x    1
. Denote as    =(   1
,   2
) a vector in 
tangent space. Maps in the projective space    1
 are defined by two segments    2
∈[−1,1] when 
   1
=1 and    1
∈[−1,1]    ℎ        2
=1. A discrete dynamic system on a tangent bundle is given as  
 
(
      +1
      +1
)=(
   +   (             (      )−             (      ))
   (             (      )+             (      ))
),

(      ,      )
)
 
 
(

   ).
 
 
Let the point    of the projective space define a straight line    ⊂   2
, and    has a coordinate    1
=
   ∈[−1,1] on the map    2
=1. This means that the vector    =(   ,1) lies in the subspace E. Let Differential equations and control processes, N. 3, 2024

the image    (   ,   )   =(   1

and has a coordinate    =

By applying the localization of the chain recurrent set of the differential action in the projective 
bundle, four components are obtained: Ω
11
,Ω
12
, Ω
21
 and Ω
22
. At the same time, the components 
Ω
11
,Ω
12
 are projected on Ω
1
⊂   2
, components Ω
21
 and Ω
22
 are projected on Ω
2
⊂   2
. According 
to the Theorem 3, the tangent bundle over Ω
1
 is decomposed into a direct sum  
 
      2
|
   1
=   11
⨁   12
, 
 
where the bundle    11
 is generated by a component Ω
11
: 
 
   11
={   ∈    −1
(   1
 ):    ≠ 0  ⇒
   |   |
=   ∈    11
}, 
  
and the bundle    12
 is generated by a component Ω
12
: 
 
   12
={   ∈    −1
(   1
 ):    ≠ 0  ⇒
   |   |
=   ∈    12
}. 
 
To confirm the results obtained, Lyapunov exponents of the periodic trajectory Ω
1
 were calculated, 
which showed that Ω
1
 is a hyperbolic periodic trajectory. The similar decomposition also takes 
place over the component Ω2 
 
      2
|
   2
=   21
⨁    22
. 
 
To verify these data, three periodic trajectories    2
,   4
,    6
 with the periods 2, 4, 6 were found in the 
component Ω
2
,  and they also turned out to be hyperbolic ones.
