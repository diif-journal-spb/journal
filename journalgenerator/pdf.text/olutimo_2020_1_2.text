Abstract. We present in this paper the problem of convergence behavior
of solutions of certain third-order nonlinear delay differential equations and
obtained the su cient conditions involved under which the solutions of the delay
differential equation are convergent. An example is also given to demonstrate
the correctness of the proposed approach which improves earlier results on delay
differential equations.
Keywords: Convergence of solutions, complete Lyapunov function, nonlinear
delay differential equations of third-order.
1 Introduction
This paper considers the problem of convergence of solutions of third-order
nonlinear delay differential equation

where a;b are positive constants and functions h;p are continuous in their re-
spective arguments. Also, 0 r(t) ,r
0
(t)  , 0<  < 1,  and are some
positive constants,  will be determined later.Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 1, 2020
Several authors have investigated the qualitative and other properties of solu-
tions of various forms of equation (1) in [17] where the Lyapunov second method
was used. In cases where a;b are nonlinear or continuous, several results have
been obtained on the more general form of (1) in one way or another involving
the use of generalized Routh-Hurwitz conditions on the nonlinear terms and
h in some form or the other, see [3 - 9] and [12], [13], [14], [16], [19], [20].
The Routh-Hurwitz conditions on h when specialized to equation (1) and its
various forms, usually take the form h
0
(x) and
h(x)
x
; x6= 0 to lie in an open
Routh-Hurwitz interval (0;ab). Almost all the results mentioned above hold
good for h not depending on the deviating arguments or delay being zero, but
there are some results [1], [2], [10], [11], [15], [18], [21], [22] who investigated
the qualitative behavior of solutions on stability, uniform boundedness and so
on except of course the convergence of solutions where h actually depend on
some deviating arguments. Analysis of the convergence behaviour of solutions
for nonlinear delay differential equations is quite complicated. The di culties
of the convergence of solutions of nonlinear delay system increases depending
on the assumptions made on h and the requirement for a complete Lyapunov
function.(See also [6]).
Our motivation come from the above mentioned papers. To the best of our
knowledge in the relevant literature, till now, the convergence of solutions of
(1) and its various forms has not been discussed. We established su cient con-
ditions for the convergence (when p6= 0) of solutions of (1) which extend and
improves some well known results in the literature. Results obtained are not
only new but also for the development of more general formulations.
De nition 1 Any two solutions x
1
(t), x
2
(t) of (1) are said to converge if
x
1
(t) x
2
(t)! 0; x
0
1
(t) x
0
2
(t)! 0; x
00
1
(t) x
00
2
(t)! 0 as t!1:
If the relations above are true of each other(arbitrary) pair of solutions of (1),
we shall describe this saying that all solutions of (1) converge.
Now, we will state the stability criteria for the general non-autonomous
delay differential system. We consider:
_ x =f(t;x);x
t
=x(t + )  r    0;t  0; (2)
where f : I C
H
 !R
n
is a continuous mapping,
f(t; 0) = 0;C
H
:=f 2 (C[ r; 0];R

and for H

 H, there exists L(H

jf( )j L(H

De nition 2 ([2],[19]) An element 2 C is in the !-limit set of  , say,

( ), if x(t; 0; ) is de ned on [0;1) and there is a sequenceft

( )  k! 0 as n!1 where

De nition 3 ([2],[19]) A set Q2 C
H
is an invariant set if for any  2 Q,
the solution of (2), x(t; 0; ), is de ned on [0;1) and x
t
( )2Q for t2 [0;1).
Lemma 1 ([2],[19]) An element 2C
H
is such that the solutionx
t
( ) of (2)
with x
o
( ) =  is de ned on [0;1) andkx
t
( )k H

<H for t2 [0;1), then

( ) is a non-empty, compact, invariant set and
dist(x

( ); 
( ))! 0 as t!1:
Lemma 2 ([2],[19]) Let V (t; ) : I C
H
 ! R be a continuous functional
satisfying a local Lipschitz condition. V (t; ) = 0, and such that:
(i) W

k k where W

(r), W
2
(r) are wedges
(ii)
_
V
(2)

:
Then the zero solution of (2) is uniformly stable. If we de ne Z =f 2 C
H
:
V
(2)
(t; ) = 0g, then the zero solution of (2) is asymptotically stable provided
that the largest invariant set in Z is Q =f0g.
Lemma 3 ([19]) Let V (t; ) :R C

 !R be continuous and locally Lips-
chitz in  . If

(2) are uniformly bounded and uniformly ultimately bounded for bound B.

Now, we write the equation (1) as the following equivalent system:

satisfy a Lipschitz condition in x.

Conclusion So, we can formulate the CONVERGENCE CRITERIA OF
NONLINEAR DELAY SYSTEM (1): the solutions of the third order nonlin-
ear system are convergent according to Lyapunov's theory if the conditions of
Theorem 1 hold.
Analysis of nonlinear systems literary shows that Lyapunov's theory in con-
vergence of solutions of nonlinear delay differential equations is rarely scarce.
The second Lyapunov's method allows to predict the convergence of solutions
of nonlinear delay physical system.
