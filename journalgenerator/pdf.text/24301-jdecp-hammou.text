Abstract.This paper is concerned with the study of a nonlinear problem in-
volving the fractional p(x)−Laplacian operator. By means of the Berkovits
degree theory, we prove the existence of nontrivial weak solutions for this prob-
lem. The appropriate functional framework for this problem is the fractional
Sobolev spaces with variable exponent.
Keywords:Nonlinear elliptic problem, fractional p(x)−Laplacian operator,
fractional Sobolev spaces with variable exponent, Degree theory.
1 Introduction
Great attention was paid to the study of elliptic problems including the frac-
tional operator during the last years. The study of this type of problems is
motivated by their abilities to model several physical phenomena such as those
of phase transition, continuum mechanics and dynamics. Fractional operator is
also present in game theory and probability which he provides a simple model
to describe stochastic stabilization of L´ evy jump processes (see [2, 7, 8, 9] and
the references therein).

Using another technique based on topological degree theory, notably the
recent Berkovits degree, we prove in this paper the existence of at least one
nontrivial weak solution the problem (P).
The paper is divided into four sections. In the second section, we intro-
duce some preliminary results about Lebesgue and fractional Sobolev spaces
with variable exponent, some classes of operators and an outline of the recent
Berkovits degree. The third section is reserved for some technical lemmas.
Finally, in the fourth section we give our main results concerning the weak
solutions of the problem (P).

2.2 Some classes of operators and an outline of Berkovits degree
Let X be a real separable reﬂexive Banach space with dual X
∗
and with con-
tinuous pairing ⟨:; :⟩ and let Ω be a nonempty subset of X.
Let Y be a real Banach space. We recall that a mapping F : Ω⊂ X → Y
is bounded, if it takes any bounded set into a bounded set. F is said to be
demicontinuous, if for any (u
n
)⊂ Ω, u
n
→ u implies F(u
n
) * F(u). F is said
to be compact if it is continuous and the image of any bounded set is relatively
compact.

Let Ω⊂R
N
, N ≥ 2; be a smooth bounded open set, s∈ (0;1) and we assume
that (1), (2) and (3) hold. In this section, we present two technical lemmas
that we will need to study our problem (P).

(iii) L is a homeomorphism.

It’s obvious that   is continuous. We prove that   is bounded.

4 Main Result
In this section, we study the nonlinear problem (P) based on the Berkovits
degree theory introduced in subsection 2.2, where Ω⊂R
N
, N ≥ 2; is a smooth
bounded open, s∈ (0;1) and under assumptions (1), (2) with sp(x;y)<N and
(3) .
Let L and S :W
0

∗
0
(Ω) be as in Section 3.

Deﬁnition 2 We say that u∈W
0
is a weak solution of (P) if
⟨Lu;'⟩+⟨Su;'⟩ = 0; ∀'∈W
0
:
Theorem 2 Under assumptions (1), (2) and (3), the problem (P) has a weak
solution u in W
0
:
Proof u∈W
0
is a weak solution of (P) if and only if
Lu =−Su: (6)
Thanks to the properties of the operator L seen in Lemma 2 and in view of
Minty-Browder Theorem [17, Theorem 26A], the inverse operator
T := L
−1
: W
∗
0
→ W
0
is bounded, continuous and satisﬁes condition (S
+
).
Moreover, note by Lemma 3 that the operator S is bounded, continuous and
quasimonotone.
Consequently, equation (6) is equivalent to
u =Tv and v+S◦Tv = 0: (7)
To solve (7), we will apply the degree theory introduced in section 2. To do
this, we ﬁrst claim that the set
B :={v∈W
∗
0
|v+tS◦Tv = 0 for some t∈ [0;1]}
is bounded. Indeed, let v∈B. Set u :=Tv, then ∥Tv∥
W

:
If ∥u∥
W

≤ 1, then ∥Tv∥

If ∥u∥

inequality (5) the estimate

From the continuous embedding L

It follows that {Tv|v∈B} is bounded.
By writing B = {v ∈ W
∗
0
|v = −tS ◦Tv for some t ∈ [0;1]} and taking into
account the boundedness of Tv (v∈B), S and t (t∈ [0;1]), we can see that B
is bounded in W
∗
0
. Consequently, there exists R> 0 such that
∥v∥
W
∗
0
<R for all v∈B:
Therefore, if v = ∈B
R
(0), then v = ∈B, that is v+tS◦Tv̸= 0 for all t∈ [0;1]: In
particular
v+tS◦Tv̸= 0 for all v∈@B

From Lemma 1 it follows that
I +S◦T ∈F

(0)) and I =L◦T ∈F
T
(B

Since the operators I, S and T are bounded, I +S◦T is also bounded. We
conclude that
I +S◦T ∈F

Consider a homotopy H : [0;1]×B

given by
H(t;v) :=v+tS◦Tv for (t;v)∈ [0;1]×B
R
(0):
Applying the homotopy invariance and normalization property of the degree d
stated in Theorem 1, we get
d(I +S◦T;B
R
(0);0) =d(I;B
R
(0);0) = 1;
and hence there exists a point v∈B
R
(0) such that
v+S◦Tv = 0:
We conclude that u =Tv is a weak solution of (P).
