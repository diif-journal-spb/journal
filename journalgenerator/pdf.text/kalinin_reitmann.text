Abstract.
We investigate control systems as variational equations in non-standard chains
of rigged Hilbert spaces. Monotonicity properties of nonlinearities are intro-
duced with respect to such riggings generated by Lyapunov operators and in-
variant cones. Su cient frequency domain conditions for boundedness and the
existence of Bohr and Stepanov almost periodic solutions are derived. As an
example we consider equations with Du ng-type nonlinearities and almost pe-
riodic forcing terms.
1 Introduction
Let us introduce some function spaces. Suppose (E;k k
E
) is a Banach space.
If J   R is an interval, denote by C(J;E) the space of all continuous
functions from J to E, endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on

C(G;E) of bounded functions equipped with the norm

2 Control systems with monotone nonlinearities
Consider the Gelfand rigging of a real Hilbert space Y
0
, i.e. a chain
Y

 Y

 Y

(1)
in which Y
1
(\positive" space) and Y
 1
(\negative" space) are further real
Hilbert spaces and the inclusions are dense and continuous. Let ( ; )

, respectively.
Continuity of the inclusions means that there are constants k
1
> 0 and k

such that

Suppose that the rigging (1) { (3) is realized in the following sense ([1, 15]).
Assume that from the inclusion chain (1) only Y
1
  Y
0
is given and (2) is
satis ed, for simplicity, with k
1
= 1. We introduce on Y
0
a second norm by
kyk
 1
:= sup
06= 2Y
1
j(y; )
0
j
k k
1
(4)
and denote by Y
 1
the completion of Y
0
with respect to this norm. Then Y
 1
can be taken as third space in the Gelfand rigging (1) (see [1, 15]). This space
can be considered as dual to Y
1
with respect to Y
0
, i.e. when the duality of Y
1
and Y
 1
is written in terms of Y
0
. Extending by continuity the function (u;v)
0
onto Y
 1
 Y
1
, we get the pairing between Y
 1
and Y
1
, i.e. the bilinear form
( ; )
 1;1
on Y
 1
 Y
1
which coincides with ( ; )
0
on Y

and which satis es
the inequality

: (5)
With respect to the chain (1) we consider the three linear operators
A2L(Y
1
;Y
 1
); B2L(R;Y
 1
); C2L(Y
0
;R): (6)
Together with the operator A2L(Y
1
;Y
 1
) we also need the adjoint with
respect to Y
0
operator A
+
2L(Y
1
;Y
 1
) which is given by the relation ([1])
(Ay; )
 1;1
= (A

 ;y)
 1;1
; 8y; 2Y
1
: (7)
If A
+
=A the operator A is called self-adjoint with respect to Y
0
. The adjoint-
ness with respect to Y
0
can be introduced similarly for linear operators acting
between other spaces in the chain (1).
The construction of some auxilary evolutionary variational equation is based
on the following function spaces which we shortly introduce.
If 1 T

Bochner measurable functions ([15]) in L

there exists
a control ff( )2L

is well-posed in the variational sense on (0; +1):
Let us denote by H

equivalent to (16).
Let us show that P  0: Introduce on Y

the Lyapunov functional V (y) :=

But this implies that V (y

In the following we suppose the properties (H1) { (H5). Thus we can as-
sume that there exists an operatorP and a number"> 0 satisfying (17). Note
that the operator P can be explicitly determined as solution of a Hamiltonian
system of equations ([8]). The number "> 0 can be estimated with the knowl-
edge of  . Our aim is to derive with the help of P a new Gelfand chain from
(1) which is better adapted to the nonlinear system which will be investigated.
Consider in Y

the new scalar product ( ; )

given by
(y; )
0;P
:= (y;P )

:
The associated norm is denoted byk k
0;P
. The completion of Y
0
w.r.t. the
scalar product ( )
0;P
gives the Hilbert space Y
0;P
: The space Y
1
is dense in Y
0;P
since Y
1
is dense in Y
0
and Y
0
is dense in Y
0;P
. By (2) and the boundedness of

the inclusion Y

of Hilbert spaces. In order to de ne the negative space in this chain explicitly
we introduce ([1]) on Y

Let us denote the pairing between Y

If we put in (17)y =  # and  ='(t;C ) '(t;C#) we receive the inequality

From (25) it follows that the second term on the left-hand side of (34) is non-

(P2): This is equivalent to the property that for each t2R

The following lemma is a slight modi cation of Theorem 3.1, Ch. 3 and
Lemma 1.11, Ch. 4 from [11]. The proof is omitted.

due to the boundedness of P , lim

The next lemma is concerned with the separation of quadratic cones by
special functionals. Let us recall some de nitions. Assume that H is a Hilbert
space with scalar product ( ; ): A cone in H is a setC  H;C6=?, such that
u2C; 2R
+
imply that u2C. It is easy to see that a coneC inH is convex
if and only if u;v2C imply that u +v2C:
Suppose that P2L(H);P =P
 
. Then the setC :=fu2Hj (u;Pu)  0g
is a cone which is called by us quadratic.
Assume that there is a decomposition H = H
+
 H
 
such that P
jH
+  0
and P
jH
   0. Then the quadratic conefu2 Hj (u;Pu)  0g is called by us
quadratic cone of dimension dimH

SinceC is a cone, we have  y

Since the inclusions Y

Because of (82) we have
2 (h

Since ( ; )

From (82) we conclude that 2 (h

we have for each "

Take now   n := maxfn

It follows from (88) and (92) that (r;h

Equation (95) shows that assumption (83) of Lemma 5 takes the form

also satis ed.
In the followingT

;i = 1; 2; 3; 4; are the sets which are de ned in Lemma 6.
It follows from (104) that if t2T

then z(t) = z

: Thus we have by (64) and
(3.9a) that
_ w(t) =d

[ (t;w(t)) +g(t)]< 0: (109)
In the same way one shows that w(t) is non-decreasing in a neighborhood of

From (104) and the inequalityd

Thus we have veri ed all hypotheses of Lemma 6. By this lemma it follows
thatG is positively invariant. It remains to show the inclusion (75). Let z =

Proof. Consider system (64) written in the form (65). Introduce the new
nonlinearity

system (112) for all (

 R: Thus the positive invariance ofG for
(64) implies that solutions of (112) with initial states fromG are also solutions
of (64). The forward solutions of (64) inG can be used to construct for any
g2BS
2
(R;R) a bounded solution of (64) which satis es (112).  
(A10) Any continuous function   which satis es (3.9a) and (3.9b) has a con-
tinuous extension to a function

For system (117) with a nonlinearity of the type (118) we can apply Theorems
