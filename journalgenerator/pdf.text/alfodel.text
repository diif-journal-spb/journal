Abstract
Urysohn-Stieltjes integral operators and Urysohn-Stieltjes integral equations
have been studied by some authors. In this paper we prove the existence of at
least one weak solution of a coupled system of Urysohn-Stieltjes integral equa-
tions in the reexive Banach space. We used the O'Regan  xed point theorem
and some propositions. As an application, the coupled system of Hammerstien-
Stieltjes integral equations is also studied.
Keywords: Weak solution, weakly Riemann-Stieltjes integral, coupled system,
weakly relatively compact.
1 Introduction and preliminaries
The Volterra-Stieltjes integral equations and Urysohn-Stieltjes integral equa-
tions have been studied by J. Bana  s and some other authors (see [1]-[9] and
[18]- [20]).Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2018
Consider the Urysohn-Stieltjes integral equation
x(t) =p(t) +
Z

f(t;s;x(s)) d
s
g(t;s); t2I = [0; 1]: (1)
J. Bana  s (see [5]) proved the existence of at least one solution x2C(I) to the
equation (1), where g :I I!R is nondecreasing in the second argument on
I and the symbol d
s
indicates the integration with respect to s.
For the de nition, background and properties of the Stieltjes integral we re-
fer to Bana  s [1]. However, the coupled system of integral equations have been
studied, recently, by some authors (see [13]-[14],[16]).
In this paper, we generalize this results to study the existence of weak solu-
tions (x;y) 2 C[I;E] C[I;E] for the coupled system of Urysohn-Stieltjes
integral equations

Now, we shall present some auxiliary results that will be needed in this work.
Let E be a Banach space (need not be reexive) and let x : [a;b]!E, then
(1-) x(:) is said to be weakly continuous (measurable) at t
0
2 [a;b] if for every
 2E
 
;  (x(:)) is continuous (measurable) at t
0
.
(2-) A function h : E! E is said to be weakly sequentially continuous if h
maps weakly convergent sequences in E to weakly convergent sequences
in E.
Ifx is weakly continuous onI, thenx is strongly measurable and hence weakly
measurable (see [17] and [11]). It is evident that in reexive Banach spaces,
ifx is weakly continuous function on [a;b], thenx is weakly Riemann integrable
(see [17]). Since the space of all weakly Riemann-Stieltjes integrable functions
is not complete, we will restrict our attention to the existence of weak solutions
of the coupled system (2) in the space C[I;E] C[I;E].
De nition 1 Let f : I E ! E. Then f(t;u) is said to be weakly-weakly
continuous at (t
0
;u
0
) if given   > 0;  2 E
 
there exists   > 0 and a weakly
open set U containing u
0
such that
j (f(t;u) f(t
0
;u
0
))j< 
whenever
jt t
0
j<  and u2U:
Now, we have the following  xed point theorem, due to O'Regan, in the
reexive Banach space (see [21]) and some propositions which will be used in
the sequel (see [12]).
Theorem 1 LetE be a Banach space and letQ be a nonempty, bounded, closed
and convex subset of C[I;E] and let F :Q!Q be a weakly sequentially con-
tinuous and assume that FQ(t) is relatively weakly compact inE for eacht2I.
Then, F has a  xed point in the set Q.
Proposition 1 In reexive Banach space, the subset is weakly relatively com-
pact if and only if it is bounded in the norm topology.
Proposition 2 Let E be a normed space with y2 E and y6= 0. Then there
exists a '2E
 
withk'k= 1 and kyk='(y).

2 Main results
In this section, we present our main result by proving the existence of weak
solutions for the coupled system of Urysohn-Stieltjes integral equations (2) in
the reexive Banach space E. Let us  rst state the following assumptions:
(i) a
i
2C[I;E]; i = 1; 2:
(ii) f
i
: I I D! E; where D  E and i = 1; 2 satisfy the following
condtions:
(1) f
i
(:;s;x(s))is continuous function, 8s2I;x2D E:
(2) f
i
(t;:;:) is weakly-weakly continuous function, 8t2I:
(3) The weak closure of the range off
i
(I I D) are weakly compact in
E (or equivalently: there exists a constantM such thatkf
i
(t;s;x)k 
M:
(iii) The functions g
i
: I I ! R and the functions t! g
i
(t; 1) and t!
g
i
(t; 0) (i = 1; 2) are continuous onI; and   = maxfsupjg
i
(t; 1)j + supj
g
i
(t; 0)j on Ig:
(iv) For allt
1

2I such thatt
1
<t
2
the functionss!g
i
(t
2
;s) g
i
(t
1
;s) are
nondecreasing on I.
(v) g
i
(0;s) = 0 for any s2I.
Remark 1. Observe that assumptions (iv) and (v) imply that the functions!
g(t;s) is nondecreasing on the intervalI, for any  xedt2I (Remark 1 in [6]).
Indeed, putting t
2
= t; t
1
= 0 in (iv) and keeping in mind (v), we obtain
the desired conclusion. From this observation, it follows immediately that, for
every t2I, the function s!g(t;s) is of bounded variation on I.
De nition 2 By a weak solution for the coupled system (2), we mean the pair
of functions (x;y)2C[I;E] C[I;E] such that

Theorem 2 Under assumptions (i)-(v), the coupled system of Urysohn-
Stieltjes integral equation (2) has at least one weak solution (x;y)2C[I;E] 
C[I;E].
Proof. De ne an operator A by
A(x;y) = (A

y;A

y)
where
A

f

(t;s;x(s)) d

g

For every x
i
2 C[I;E], f
i
(:;s;x(s)) is continuous on I; and f
i
(t;:;x(:)) are
weakly continuous on I; then '(f
i
(t;:;x(:))) are continuous for every '2E
 
.
Hence, in view of bounded variational of g
i
it follows, f
i
(t;s;x(s)) is weakly
Riemann-Stieltjes integrable on I with respect to s! g
i
(t;s). Thus A
i
make
sense.

Note thatQ is nonempty, uniformly bounded and strongly equi-continuous sub-
set of X; by the uniform boundedness of AQ: Thus, according to propositions

It remains to prove that A is weakly sequentially continuous.
Letfy

Thus, A is weakly sequentially continuous on Q.
Since all conditions of Theorem 1 are satis ed, then the operatorA has at least
one  xed point (x;y) = u2 Q and the coupled system of Urysohn-Stieltjes
integral equations (2) has at least one weak solution.

solution for the coupled system of Hammerstien-Stieltjes integral equations (3),
consider the following the assumption:

are such that h

satisfy the
following assumptions:
(1)
 
h

(s;x(s)) are weakly-weakly continuous functions.

Now, to prove the existence of a weak solutions of (3), we have the following
theorem
Theorem 3 Let the assumptions (i),(iii)-(v)and (ii)
 
be satis ed. Then the
coupled system of Hammerstien-Stieltjes integral equations (3) has at least one
weak solution (x;y)2X:
Proof. Let

Then from the assumption (ii)
