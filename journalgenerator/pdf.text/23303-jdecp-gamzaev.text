Abstract. The problem of identifying the multiplier of the right side of a one-dimensional wave 
equation depending on a spatial variable is considered. As additional information, the condition of 
the final redefinition is set. A discrete analogue of the inverse problem is constructed using the 
finite difference method. To solve the resulting difference problem, a special representation is 
proposed, with the help of which the difference problem splits into two independent difference 
problems. As a result, an explicit formula is obtained for determining the approximate value of the 
desired function for each discrete value of a spatial variable. The presented results of numerical 
experiments conducted for model problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
computational algorithm. 
 
 
Keywords: wave equation, identification of the right side of the wave equation, inverse problem, 
final redefinition, difference problem. 
 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
   It is known that inverse problems of determining the right-hand sides of wave equations arise in the 
mathematical modeling of many physical processes in geophysics, seismics, electrodynamics, 
thermophysics, medicine and many other fields of science and technology [1-4]. In these inverse 
problems, in addition to solving the wave equation, it is necessary to determine the dependence of the right 
parts on time or on spatial coordinates. Usually, when considering the problems of identifying the right-
hand sides of partial differential equations, two independent tasks are distinguished: identification of 
dependence on time and identification of dependence on a spatial variable. Most publications devoted to Differential equations and control processes, N. 3, 2023

the problems of identifying the right-hand sides of wave equations mainly consider the case when the 
right-hand side depends on time and investigate the issues of correctness, existence, unambiguous 
solvability of problems, etc. [5-11]. 
    In this paper, we propose a numerical method for solving problems of identifying the right-hand 
sides of wave equations, in cases where the dependence of the right-hand side on a spatial variable is 
unknown.

  It is known that the direct problem for equation (1) consists in determining a function ) , ( t x u
 
from 
equation (1) with a given coefficient ) (x k , the right side ) , ( ) ( t x f x p
  
and conditions (2)–(5). 
   Suppose that in addition  to the function  ) , ( t x u ,  the function ) (x p
 
is also unknown and it is 
required to restore this function according to the following condition of the final redefinition 
  
) ( ) , ( x r T x u  ,     (6) 
where ) (x r is the given function.  
   Thus, the task  is to determine the functions ) , ( t x u and ) (x p satisfying equation  (1) and conditions 
(2) – (6). It should be noted that the mathematical description of the action of external forces in wave 
processes can always be reduced to a representation ) , ( ) ( t x f x p (in particular cases it may be 
const t x f  ) , ( ). At the same time, the separation of the function ) , ( t x f in time and space is not 
considered necessary. 
    The problem belongs to the class of inverse problems associated with the restoration of the right 
parts of partial differential equations. We assume that the formulated inverse problem (1)–(6) is uniquely 
solvable. Note that the unique solvability of this class of problems was studied in detail in [12–14]. 
   To solve the problem (1)–(6), we first construct its discrete analogue using the finite difference 
method. We introduce a uniform difference grid

It is obvious that in this case equation (14) and conditions (15)–(18) are fulfilled automatically. The 
difference problems (19)–(23) and (24)–(28) for each fixed value    1 , . . . , 2 , 1   m j
 
are systems of 
linear algebraic equations with a tridiagonal matrix, the solutions of which, regardless of

by the Thomas method [15]. Having determined the values of the variables

  The results of numerical experiments show that the values of the desired functions ) , ( t x u  and  ) (x p
are determined with a sufficiently high accuracy. Moreover, the maximum relative error in determining 
the desired function ) (x p in both problems does not exceed  0.5%.  Numerical results obtained for two 
different values of T indicate the stability of the solution with respect to T. 
Analysis of the results of numerical experimentation indicates that it is sufficient to use small steps of 
the difference grid to increase the accuracy of solutions. 
 
4.  Conclusion 
 
 The problem of identifying the right-hand side of a one-dimensional wave equation depending on a 
spatial variable according to an additional condition of final redefinition is considered. The proposed 
computational algorithm, based on the discretization of the problem and the use of a special representation 
for solving the difference problem, allows us to find by an explicit formula the approximate value of the 
desired function for each discrete value of the spatial variable.
