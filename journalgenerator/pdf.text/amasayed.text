Abstract In this work, we establish an existence result (based on O'Regan
 xed point theorem) for a nonlinear fractional-order nonlocal boundary value
problem.
Keywords: Fractional calculus; Nonlocal boundary value problem.
1 Preliminaries and Introduction
LetL
1
(I) be the space of Lebesgue integrable functions on the intervalI = [0; 1].
Unless otherwise stated, E is a reexive Banach space with normjj:jj and dual
E
 
. We will denote byE
w
the spaceE endowed with the weak topology (E;E
 
)
and denote by C[I;E] the Banach space of strongly continuous functions u :
I!E with sup-normjj:jj
0
.
We recall that the fractional integral operator of order   > 0 with left-hand
point a is de ned by (see [4], [9], [10] and [15])

We recall the following de nitions. LetE be a Banach space and letu :I!E.
ThenDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2008
(1) u(:) is said to be weakly continuous (measurable) at t
0
2 I if for every
'2E
 
we have '(u(:)) continuous (measurable) at t
0
.
(2) A function h : E! E is said to be weakly sequentially continuous if h
takes weakly convergent sequences inE to weakly convergent sequences in
E.
If u is weakly continuous on I, then u is strongly measurable (see [3]), hence
weakly measurable.
Note that in reexive Banach spaces weakly measurable functions are Pettis
integrable (see [1], [3] and [8] for the de nition) if and only if'(u(:)) is Lebesgue
integrable on I for every '2E
 
(see [3]).
Now, we present some auxiliary results that will be needed in this paper. Firstly,
we state O'Regan  xed point theorem ([7]).
Theorem 1.1 Let E be a Banach space with Q a nonempty, bounded, closed,
convex, equicontinuous subset ofC[I;E]. SupposeT :Q!Q is weakly sequen-
tially continuous and assume TQ(t) is weakly relatively compact in E for each
t2I, holds. Then the operator T has a  xed point in Q.
The following theorems can be found in [2], [16] and [5] respectively.
Theorem 1.2 (Dominated convergence theorem for Pettis integral)
Let u : I! E. Suppose there is a sequence (u
n
) of Pettis integrable functions
from I into E such that lim
n!1
'(u
n
) = '(u) a.e. for '2 E
 
. If there is a
scalar function 2 L

integrable and

Theorem 1.3 A subset of a reexive Banach space is weakly compact if and
only if it is closed in the weak topology and bounded in the norm topology.
Theorem 1.4 Let Q be a weakly compact subset of C[I;E]. Then Q(t) is
weakly compact subset of E for each t2I.
Finally, we state some results which is an immediate consequence of the Hahn-
Banach theorem.
Theorem 1.5 LetE be a normed space withu
0
6= 0. then there exists a'2E
 
withjj'jj = 1 and '(u
0
) =jju
0
jj.

Theorem 1.6 If u

2E is such that '(u
0
) = 0 for every '2E
 
, then u
0
= 0.
In this work we study the existence of solutions, in the Banach space C[I;E],
of the nonlocal boundary value problem

2 Fractional-order integrals in reexive Banach spaces
Here, we de ne the fractional-order integral operator in reexive Banach spaces.
De nition given below is an extension of such a notion for real-valued functions.
De nition 2.1 Let u : I ! E be a weakly measurable function, such that

In the above de nition the sign "

Such an integral is well de ned (see [11]):

Lemma 2.2 Let u :I!E be weakly continuous function on [0; 1]. Then, FPI
ofu exists for almost everyt2 [0; 1] as a weakly continuous function from [0; 1]
to E. Moreover,
'(I

In the above de nition the sign "D" denotes the Pseudo differential operator

The following lemma can be found in [13]
Lemma 2.3 Let u : [0; 1]! E be weakly continuous function on [0; 1] such
that the real-valued function I

'u is n-times differentiable. Then, the FPD
of u of order ff2 (n  1;n), exists.

we have the following lemma [11]:

3 Main result
In this section we present our main result by proving the existence of solutions
of the equation (2) in C[I;E].
Let E be a reexive Banach space. And let
E
r
= fu 2 C[I;E] : jjujj
0
<
M
r
 (1 +  )
+ rg (r > 0);
wherejj:jj

is the sup-norm. We will consider the set
B
r
= fu(t) 2 E : u 2 E

Now, we are in a position to formulate and prove our main result.
Theorem 3.1 Let the assumptions (1) - (3) are satis ed.
If
(ff + 1) M
r
(1   ff

)  (1 +  )
< r
Then equation (2) has at least one weak solution u2C[I;E].
Proof: Let us de ne the operator T as

f(s;u(s)) ds;   2 (1; 2); t 2 I:
We will solve equation (2) by  nding a  xed point of the operator T .
We claim
T : C[I;E] ! C[I;E]:
To prove our claim,  rst note that assumption (2) implies that for each
u2 C[I;E], f(:;u(:)) is weakly measurable on I. The fact that f has weakly
compact range means that '(f(:;u(:))) is Lebesgue integrable on I for ev-
ery ' 2 E
 
and thus the operator T is well de ned. Now, we show that
if u 2 C[I;E], then Tu 2 C[I;E]. Note that there exists r > 0 with

Note thatQ is nonempty, closed, bounded, convex and equicontinuous subset of
C[I;E]. Now, we claim thatT :Q!Q and is weakly sequentially continuous.
If this is true then according to Theorem 1.3,TQ is bounded inC[I;E] (hence,
Theorem 1.4, implies TQ(t) is weakly relatively compact in E for each t2 I)
and the result follows immediately from Theorem 1.1. It remains to prove
our claim. First we show that T maps Q into Q. To see this, note that the
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal/ 36Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2008
inequality (2) shows that TQ is norm continuous. Now, take u2 Q; without
loss of generality, we may assume that I

f(t;u(t))6= 0, then, by Theorem 1.5,
there exists '2E

Thus T : Q! Q. Finally, we will show that T is weakly sequentially contin-
uous. To see this, letfu

w
for each t2 [0; 1]. Recall [5] that a sequencefu
n
g
1
n=1
is weakly convergent in
C[I;E] if and only if it is weakly pointwise convergent in E. Fix t2 I. From
the weak sequential continuity of f(t;:), the Lebsegue dominated convergence
theorem (see assumption (3)) for the Pettis integral [2] implies for each '2E
 
that '(Tu
n
(t))!'(Tu(t)) a.e. on I, Tu
n
(t)!Tu(t) in E
w
. So T :Q!Q is
weakly sequentially continuous. The proof is complete.
Now, we are looking for su cient conditions to ensure the existence of Pseudo
solution to the boundary value problem (1).
Theorem 3.2 If f : I B

then the boundary value problem (1) has at least one solution u2C[I;E].
