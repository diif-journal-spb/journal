Abstract 
For a controllable autonomous linear system, an initial value problem is presented, which depends only 
on (a) the matrices in the system (b) the initial state and (c) duration of control, such that its (unique) 
solution provides one possible control function. The dependence need not determine the initial value 
uniquely. 
Keywords: Control, linear autonomous, initial value problem.

1. Introduction 
Let B be an n×m matrix and A and n×n matrix such that the pair (A,B) is controllable in the usual sense that the 
autonomous initial value problem 
0
',(0) x xAx Bu x =+= 
on has the property that, for any n×1 vector x [0, ) ∞
0
 and any positive T, there exists an m×1 vector function u, 
called control, such that the solution vanishes at T. We shall show that one possible control is the unique 
solution of an n
th
 order differential equation that depends on A, B, x
0
 as well as T. In fact, the coefficients in the 
differential equation are the same as in the characteristic polynomial of A but alternate in sign.

has a (unique) solution. A computation from the differential equations and the initial condition shows that the 
Wronskian matrix of the solution at t = 0 is the identity matrix I. Thus (2) holds. 
Now, by the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem,

Since u(0) = I, it follows that (1) and (4) hold.

initial value problem. Thus fact will turn out to be significant in Theorem 4.1.

4. Main result 
Now we come to the result that describes an initial value problem, the unique solution of which steers the 
controllable system x' Ax Bu =+ from initial state 
0
x to terminal state 0 at time T. In order for such a control to 
exist for every initial value 
0
x , it is necessary and sufficient that the rank of the n×mn matrix

matrix C such that C is the n×n identity matrix.

Although the hypothesis in Theorem 4.1 takes all this for granted, parts of the argument can be harvested for 
justifying the Kalman controllability criterion; see Remark 4.2 below.

 is n. Denote by C any right inverse of [,

as in Theorem 3.1 and therefore satisfy (1). Now, the solution of (9) is given by the variation of parameters

4.2. Remark. The rank condition was not used until after (11). Once this equation is derived, one can easily 
prove the equivalence of the rank condition and the existence of a suitable control. In fact, it is clear from 
equation (11) that if a suitable control exists, then every 
0
x is in the range of the linear transformation given by 
the matrix in the equation. The converse also follows from equation (11) because the column vector on the 
extreme right in the equation can be chosen to be any vector in  by virtue of Proposition 3.2.
