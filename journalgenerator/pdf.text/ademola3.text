Abstract
The behaviour of solutions to certain third order nonlinear non autonomous stochastic
delay differential equations with constant deviating arguments is considered. The main
procedure lies on the construction of a perfect Lyapunov functional which is used to
obtain suitable conditions which guarantee uniformstability, boundednessand uniqueness
of global solution for t > 0. The obtained results are new and complement related second
order stochastic differential equations that have appeared in the literature. Moreover,
examples are given to illustrate the feasibility and correctness of the main results.
Keywords: Third order; Nonlinear stochastic delay differential equation; Uniform sta-
bility; Boundedness of solutions
1 Introduction
In the applications, the future behavior of many phenomena, in science, econ-
omy, medicine, information theory, engineering and so on, are assumed to be
described by the solutions of an ordinary differential equation (ODE). In fact,
the investigation of qualitative behavior of solutions, especially, the discussionDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2017
of uniform stability, boundedness and existence of unique solutions are crucial
problems in the theory and applications of ODEs. Many interesting work on
qualitative behaviour of solutions of second-, third- and higher order ODEs,
have been discussed and are still receiving the attention of authors, see for
instance the book of Burton [21, 22], Yoshizawa [60, 61] which contain the
background to the study and the papers of Ademola et al. [3]-[10],[13, 16],
Burton and Hatvani [20], Ogundare et al. [36, 37], Raffoul [40], Tun¸ c [49],
Yoshizawa [59], Wang and Zhu [55] and the references cited therein.
A more general type of differential equations often called a “functional dif-
ferential equation” is one in which the unknown functions occur with various
different arguments. In the Russian literature these are refereed to as “differ-
ential equationswith deviatingargument.” The simplest and perhaps the most
naturaltypeoffunctionaldifferentialequationsisa“delaydifferentialequation”
(DDE)(or“differentialequationwithretardedargument”),(seeDriver[26]). In
this direction many authors have proposed different approach to discuss qual-
itative behaviour of solutions of second-, third- and higher order DDEs with
deviating arguments(single or multiple, constant or variable). We can mention
the survey books of Burton [21], Hale [25], Yoshizawa [61], and the papers of
Ademola et al. [11, 12, 14, 17, 18], Cahlon and Schmidt [23], Caraballo et al.
[24], Domoshnitsky [27], Mahmoud [33], Ogundare et al. [35], Olutimo and
Adams [39], Remili et al. [41, 42, 43], Tun¸ c et al. [46]-[48], [50]-[54], Xianfeng
and Wei [56], Yeni¸ cerio˘ glu [57, 58], Zhu [63] and the references cited therein to
mention few.
“Since Itˆ o introduced his stochastic calculus about 50 years ago, the the-
ory of stochastic differential equation (SDE) has been developed very quickly,”
(see Mao [34]). In particular, the randomness or stochastic effects (a con-
cept beyond the scope of ODE and DDE) introduced to ODE and DDE gives
birth tostochasticdifferentialequations(SDE) and stochasticdelaydifferential
equation (SDDE) respectively. In this direction, interesting articles have been
publishedbyauthorsusingdifferentapproach,seeforinstanceArnold[19],Kol-
manovskii and Shaikhet [30], Oksendal [38], Shaikhet [45], which contain the
general results on the subject matters and the dazzling papers of Abou-El-Ela
et al. [1, 2], Ademolaet al. [15], Ivanov et al. [28], Kolarova[29], Kolmanovskii
and Shaikhet [30, 31], Liu and Raffoul [32], Mao [34], Zhu et al. [62] and the
references cited therein.
In their contribution the authors in [1] discussed the stability of solutions

for certain second order SDDE
¨ x(t)+a˙ x(t)+bx(t−h)+σx(t)˙ ω(t) = 0
and
¨ x(t)+a˙ x(t)+f(x(t−h))+σx(t−τ)˙ ω(t) = 0,
where a,b and σ are positive constants, h and τ are two positive constant
delays, ω(t) ∈ R is a standard Wiener Process, the function f is continuous
with respect to x with f(0) = 0.
Moreover, the authors in [2] considered a more general problem (including
and extending the results in [1]) by introducing more nonlinear functions and
they discussed stochastic stability and boundedness of solutions for the SDDE
¨ x(t)+g(˙ x(t))+bx(t−h)+σx(t)˙ ω(t) =p(t,x(t), ˙ x(t),x(t−h)),
where a and b are positive constants and h > 0 is a constant delay, g and

literature on stochastic stability and stochastic boundedness of solutions of
nonlinear non autonomous third order SDDE (1.1). The rest of this paper is
organized as follows. In Section 2, we present deﬁnition of terms and some pre-
liminary results on SDDEs. Results and their proofs on stability, boundedness
and uniqueness of solutions of the SDDE (1.1) are discussed in Section 3, while
illustrative special cases of the SDDE (1.1) are presented in the last section.

Remark 3.1 We give the following observations
(i) Wheneverh(x(t−τ)) =cx andσx˙ ω =p(t,x, ˙ x,¨ x) = 0, then equation (1.1)
specializes to a linear ﬁrst order homogenous ODE
...
x +a¨ x+b˙ x+cx = 0, (3.5)
and assumptions (i) to (iv) of Theorem 3.1 reduces to Routh Hurwitz crite-
ria a > 0,b> 0,c> 0,ab >c for asymptotic stability of the trivial solution
of the equation (3.5).
(ii) If σx˙ ω = 0 = p(t,x, ˙ x,¨ x), then equation (1.1) specializes to a DDE dis-
cussed in [63]. Thus Theorem 3.1 includes and extends the stability result
discussed in [63].
(iii) The term σx˙ ω in SDDE (1.1) extends all results on third order differential
equation with or without delay.
(iv) The obtained results in [1, 2] and [15] are on second order stochastic dif-
ferential equations.
(v) This is the ﬁrst paper on nonlinear non-autonomous SDDE as there is no
previous literature on third order.

In view of inequalities (3.23) and (3.24) inequalities (2.5) and (2.6) of Assump-

. Also, the inequalities (3.22),

(3.23), (3.24) and (3.25) hold, so that assumption (ii) of Corollary 2.1 hold,
then by assumption (ii) of Corollary 2.1 all solutions of the SDDE (1.2) are
stochastically bounded. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.2.
Next, if p(t,x, ˙ x,¨ x) = 0 and p(t,x,y,z) = 0 in equations (1.1) and system
(1.2) respectively, we have
...
x +a¨ x+b˙ x+h(x(t−τ))+σx(t)˙ ω(t) = 0 (3.27)

Theorem 3.3 Suppose that assumptions (i) to (iii) of Theorem 3.1 and in-
equality (3.4) hold, then the trivial solution of the SDDE (3.28) is uniformly
stochastically asymptotically stable in the large.
Proof. Let (x

,z
t
) be any solution of the SDDE (3.28). Equation (3.8),
estimate (3.13) and the inequalities (3.15) satisfy assumptions (i) and (ii) of
Lemma 2.2. Next, using Itˆ o’s formula (2.3) and the system (3.28), we have
LV(t,X

for all t≥ 0,x,y and z, where δ

assumption (iii) of Lemma 2.2, thus by Lemma 2.2 the trivial solution of the
SDDE(3.28)isuniformlystochasticallyasymptoticallystableinthelarge. This
completes the proof of Theorem 3.3.
Theorem 3.4 Suppose that assumptions (i) to (iii) of Theorem 3.1 and the

Proof. Suppose that (x

equation (3.8) and inequality (3.10), assumptions (i) and (ii) of Lemma 2.1 are

. Inequality (3.30) fulﬁlls assumption (iii) of
Lemma 2.1, hence by Lemma 2.1 the trivial solution of the SDDE (3.28) is
stochastically stable. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.4.

(1.1) specializes to
...
x +a¨ x+b˙ x+h(x(t−τ))+σx(t)˙ ω(t) = p(t) (3.31)

and inequality (3.4) holds, then the solutions of the SDDE (3.32) are

Proof. The proof of Corollary 3.1 is similar to the proofs of Theorem 3.1 and
Theorem 3.2, hence it is omitted. This completes the proof of Corollary 3.1.

0
≤T <∞. In view of estimate (4.9) Assumptions 2.2
and 2.1 hold immediately. By Corollary 2.1 (i), all solutions of system (4.2)
are uniformly stochastically bounded and satisfy

Also, to apply Theorem 3.2, since the functional V(t,X
t
) deﬁned by (4.3)
is positive deﬁnite (i.e. V(t,0) = 0 and V(t,X
t
)≥ 0.2(x
2
+y
2
+z
2
)). It follows
from the upper inequality (4.4) that
V(t,X
t
)≤ 44(x
2
+y
2
+z
2
),
for all t≥ 0,x,y and z. Using this inequality in (4.7) we obtain
LV(t,X

for all t≥ 0,x,y,z where δ

. In view of inequal-
ities (4.8), (4.9) and (4.11) assumptions of Lemma 2.4 and Corollary 2.1 (ii)
hold, thus by Corollary 2.1 (ii), all solutions of system (4.2) are stochastically
bounded and satisfy estimate (4.10).

(4.13)
Items (i) to (vi) of Example 4.1 and the Lyapunov functional V(t,X
t
) of equa-
tion (4.3) are still valid for system (4.13), and that
V(t,0) = 0, (4.14)
for all t≥ 0 where 0 = (0,0,0)∈R
3
. Furthermore, inequalities (4.4) hold and
from the ﬁrst inequality in (4.4) we have
V(t,X
t
)→ +∞ as x
2
+y
2
+z
2
→∞,
so that from estimates (4.4) and (4.14), conditions (i) and (ii) of Lemma 2.2
hold.
Applying Itˆ o’s formula using equation (4.3) and system (4.13), we have
LV(t,X
t
)≤−0.06(x
2
+y
2
+z
2
) (4.15)
for all t ≥ 0,x,y and z. Inequality (4.15) fulﬁlls condition (iii) of Lemma
2.2, thus by Lemma 2.2 the trivial solution of the SDDE (4.13) is uniformly
stochastically stable in the large. This completes the veriﬁcation of Theorem
3.3.
Next, to apply Theorem 3.4 we employed the functional V(t,X
t
) deﬁned
by equation (4.3), this function is positive deﬁnite (see (4.14) and the ﬁrst
inequality in (4.4)). In addition, from inequality (4.15) we have
LV(t,X
t
)≤ 0, (4.16)
for all t ≥ 0,x,y and z. Inequality (4.16) satisﬁes (3.30). All conditions of
Lemma 2.1 hold hence by Lemma 2.1 the trivial solution of system (4.13) is
stochastically stable. This completes the veriﬁcation of Theorem 3.4.
