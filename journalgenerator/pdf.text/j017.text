Abstract.
Computer Look-Up System DIGRAN the toolbox for students, post-gra-
duates, teachers and also engineers, recherche, mathematician, which use the
mathematical models of complex dynamics process. The system use for so-
lution of the problems of mathematical modelling with this computer algebra
systems. All the software work at workstations the ﬁrms DEC, CDSystems,
Sun Microsystems and IBM PC’s. This is a computerized reference book which
promotes to specify and ﬁnd models and its solutions. More than 4000 not-
trivial solutions will be present. This software is based on the new original
approach to differential equations solving. The basis version contain original
solutions nonlinear differential equations ﬁrst, second and higher kinds, which
out with the teoretical-discrete-group methodological.Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 1998
1 Major DIGRAN beneﬁts and models classes of equa-
tions
The collection of systems, united in a DISAM project, is essentially a math-
ematical consultant on DIscrete Symmetry of Analytical Models, realised for
computer and computer algebra systems.
The system DIGRAN (DIscrete-GRoup ANalysis) is based on the new fun-
damental mathematical theory specially developed in [1] . The number of ana-
lyticalsolutionsalreadyobtainedwiththemethodfrom10to100timesexceeds
thosefoundinclassicalreferencebooks, e.g. E.Kamke[1959], G.Murphy[1960],
D.Zwillinger [1989]. For example, more than 1500 Abel equations of the second
kind and more than 800 nonlinear equations of the 3 order and higher can be
solved analytically.
Transformations, symmetries and invariants can be calculated as well.
Base of Models/Solutions is a computerized reference book which promotes
to specify and ﬁnd models and solutions. More than 4000 nottrivial solutions
will be present.
Analytical Solver of Models is an interactive computer program which gives
userawaytospecifyamodelandthenittriestoconstructananalyticalsolution
of the model in a dialogue with the user.
Visualization Block is a set of utility programs which helps the user to
investigate models and qualitative properties of solutions.

EXAMPLE 1. The information approach to problems of modeling nonlinear
systems with a priori symmetry.
The information equipment of the object domain by modeling nonlinear
systems at the expense of special metamathematical description allow, on the
one hand, consider the algorithms analysis symmetries and synthesis like the
algorithms of the production rule on the expert systems and other on the in-
formation domain introduce ”lattice concept” for utilization new information
knowledge base like the supplementary computer look-up systems. Then the
problem of resolution on closed view for nonlinear systems, describing ordinary
differential equations, reformatted like the problem invariance, just exactly, the
commutative of the diagram of information- object relations [2] . Here, for ex-
