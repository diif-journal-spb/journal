Abstract
Slow extensional ows past a porous sphere, liquid sphere and a solid smooth
sphere with slip at the surface have been obtained when all the spheres are
bounded by a sphere whose surface is stretching radially. Mass transfer to the
uid due to the inner sphere has been evaluated in each case.
1. Introduction
Steady ows of Newtonian uid past a solid sphere, liquid drop and smooth
spheres at low Reynolds numbers have been studied extensively (see Happel
and Brenner [1]). Recently Bhatt [2] has discussed these problems when the
ow at in nity is given by extensional  eld. Kawase and Moo-Young [3] ob-
tained approximate solutions of power law uid ow past a solid sphere at small
Reynolds numbers when the ow at in nity was given by the extensional  eld.Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2001
In the present problem we have extended the results of Bhatt [2] when the
spheres are bounded by a sphere whose surface is stretching radially. Using the
Stokes's approximation we get exact solutions in each case. The mass transfer
due to the presence of these spheres has been evaluated in each case. The
results of Bhatt [2] are derived as a particular case.
2. Extensional ow past a porous sphere
We cosider a porous sphere of radius a and permeability k surrounded by
a sphere of radius b whose surface is stretching such that
u
x
= 
ff

x; u
y
= 
ff
2
y; u
z
=ffz; (2:1)
where ff is constant.
The ow in the free uid region (a<r b) for steady motion is given by
rp =  r
2
v (2:2)
and
r:v = 0; (2:3)
where  is the kinematic viscosity of the uid,  is the density,p is the pressure
and v is the velocity vector. In spherical polar coordinates (r; ; ), v has
components (u
r
;u
 
; 0). We de ne the Stokes stream function to satisfy (2.3)
by
u
r

; u

and (2.2) gives

The ow in the porous region(0 r<a) is given by
U = 
k
  
rP (2:7)
and
r:U = 0 (2:8)

whereU is the velocity vector andP is the pressure in the porous region. Stokes

which satisfy (2.7) and (2.8) and we get
E

where E

The boundary conditions to be satis ed are:
At r = 0, the solution should be  nite. (2.11)
