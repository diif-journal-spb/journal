Dynamical systems on manifolds
Hedgehogs hunting
with Cantor, Hausdorff and Liouville
Alessandro Rosa
Abstract
We show the equivalence between Borel’s regular sets model and the Liouville formula
for theapproximation of irrationals through rational numbers. TheDiophantine-Liouville
dichotomy can be resolved via sequences of transﬁnitely many approximants.
The existence of non-linearizable hedgehogs is purely theoretical and their electronic
visualization is not feasible.
We show that the non-linearizable hedgehog for polynomials e
2πiθ
z +O(z
k
),k ≥ 2 is
a locally connected, plane-ﬁlling Julia set with Hausdorff dimension 2, spreading radially
everywhere inside a bounded non-empty region.Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007

1 Introduction
1.1 An overview of indifferent dynamics
Let f(z),z ∈ C be any complex function over the Riemann sphere C
∞
. The
study of the dynamical systems governed by the iterates f
n
(z) (−∞ ≤ n ≤
+∞) is termed Complex Dynamics. One speaks more properly of Holomorphic
Dynamics when f
n
(z) are analytic maps. A remarkable attention is payed to
the invariant elements, especially to the cycles of periodic points: the solutions
of the equations
f
n
(δ)≡δ.
The cycle period is rated by n. Just for simplicity, one likes to focus on the
case of n = 1, when the cycle includes one periodic point δ, which is termed
the ﬁxed point. One is also interested in studying the neighboring dynamics
near cycles: this approach begins with the classiﬁcation of cycles through an
indicator value, the modulus of the multiplier M: |M| =
Q
n
1
|f
′
(δ
n
)|. Cycles

modulus |M| = 0,|M| < 1,|M| = 1,|M| > 1, respectively. When |M| 6= 1,
the modulus is suﬃcient for determining the dynamics about δ. But the case
M = 1 might be read ambiguously, disguising behind this Euler form
|f
′
(δ)| =|e
2πiθ
| = 1, θ∈R. (1.1.1)
Here one drops M and focuses on the argument θ. The expression indifferent
dynamics refers to the local behavior of f
n
(z) inside a suﬃciently small neigh-
borhood of δ, if (1.1.1) holds: these studies became a respectful branch in the
whole theory of Holomorphic Dynamics. The role of the multiplier and of the
ﬁrst derivative naturally introduces the applicationof Taylor series to the local
studyofanyﬁxedpoint. Intheindifferentcase,thelineartermoftheexpansion
for the iteratesf

But it does not necessarily follow that

when the local dynamics off
n
(z) are

isomorphic (or geometricallyequivalent)
totherigidθ-rotation. ThefolkloreandtheliteratureinHolomorphicDynamics
divides this branch into two main subﬁelds, characterized by the following two
numerical conditions enjoyed by the argument:
θ∈Q and θ∈R\Q.
We speak of rational and irrational dynamics respectively. Although we
will apply these standard deﬁnitions in what follows, we stress that it would be
more convenient (1
◦
) to re-frame the indifferent dynamics under the viewpoint
of Lyapunov (asymptotical) stability of the iterated orbits about δ, (2
◦
) to
remove the modulus operator from (1.1.3) and (3
◦
) to focus on (1.1.2). One
can then re-edit (1.1.2) and distinguish these two situations:
e
2πiθn
= 1 or e
2πiθn
6= 1, (1.1.4)
1
Unlike all the other case, the indifferent dynamics can stand as one evidence of the possible gap between
the formal expressions and their geometrical meanings.

whenneighboringorbitsarelocallyunstableorstable,respectively. Theselatter
conditions are not quite the same as θ∈Q and θ∈R\Q. Given a generic real
θ, we will see that stability holds for the union set of rationals and of a subset
of irrationals exclusively, while instability holds in its complement.
Joining Lyapunov’s and Taylor’s view together may help to introduce the
actionperformedbythehigherorderderivativesintheTaylorseriesoff
n
(z)for
one of the cases (1.1.3)[or equivalently (1.1.4)] to hold. But it does not help to
ﬁgure out why and how this could happen or not. One such discussion belongs
to the domain of Number Theory: loosely speaking, the above action may be
stopped or not, according to the numerical conditions of θ. This suggests why
the argument θ is essential here. Again, higher order derivatives, belonging
to the Taylor series, can be compared to ‘breakers’ [keepers] of the Lyapunov
instability[stability]. Theargumentθ,if[not]endowedwithapropernumerical
condition, is [not] able to stop the breaking action.
Indifferent dynamics focus on how the numerical properties of θ guarantee
that the linear terme
2πiθn
is the only one ruling the local dynamics. Whichever
way one likes to follow (dynamical or numerical), the two-fold numerical split
is just artiﬁcial and lessens the study thanks to disjoint categories. It holds
according to how large one’s mathematicalviewpoint is. If it is the largest, dis-
tinctcasesdomergeintoone. Otherwisetherationaldynamics,relativelyeasier
to study, differ from the irrational ones, extremely complicated and thus legit-
imately settling at the hard side of the Holomorphic Dynamics. Such dynam-
ics are intimately related to analogous questions in the theory of conservative
(Hamiltonian) systems and in Celestial Mechanics (KAM theory).
There is some fashinating aura around the close relationships between ge-
ometrical and numerical features, but their level of complication may have
spawned an unpleasant counter–effect among the audience, in fact the irra-
tional case did not taste as very attractive and intriguing to specialists during
the last 60 years. It follows that the historical ﬂow of these developments is
quite winding. The former results consisted of existence statements and for-
malized during early 1900s, after Kasner’s attempts [51] and Pfeiffer’s remarks
in U.S. [76]. Independently in France, Fatou and Julia focused on the same
problem, consolidating the related mathematical groundwork as follows.

small ﬁgures because of their very narrow width. [C,D] If magniﬁed (red squares), the true nature,
as well as the wedging action, gets clearer. Finally [E] shows ﬁlaments again, highlighting another
aspect of hedgehog behavior: the plane-ﬁlling rate or, more technically, its Hausdorff dimension.
Analogously to the (super-)attracting/repelling (|f

tence theorems of local type focus on the conditions for the iterates of rational

rization’ and it is formulated into the so-called Schr¨ oder’s functional equation

A robust theory has been developed for such quadratic type germs (k = 2); conditions may be formally
different for germs of higher degree (see [99]).

If this equationholds, there existsan invertiblefunctionφ(z) mapping the iter-

the linear term a

from f

(z) to a
n
z. When a
n
= e
2πiθn
, the linearization turns f
n
(z) into the
germs g
n
(z): topologically, there exists a neighborhood centered at δ, isomor-
phic to a disc, the Siegel disc S – like in (1.1.3) – where local dynamics are
governed by the linear term of (1.1.5) exclusively. Their behavior is analogous
to aperiodic, rigid rotations. The original Fatou’s and Julia’s statements can
be ﬁled under the so-called center-problem, the expression pointing out to the
study of the conditions for the linearization (1.1.6) to hold. ‘Center’ is in fact
a dated expression
4
, still in use to indicate the equidistant interior point from
the circle-shaped boundary of the Siegel discS, where iteratesf
n
(z) rotate.
After the early developments by Kasner, Pfeiffer, Fatou, Julia, Ritt and
Cremer (in chronological order), it was clear that the conditions, for (1.1.6) to
hold, are numerical. Siegel ﬁnally showed they are Diophantine [90]. Since this
result settled a long standing question, historians liked to close the ﬁrst stage
of developments here.
During 1960s and 1970s, the branch of indifferent dynamics entered the
second stage thanks to some advancements inherited from the results in KAM
theory, from Arnold’s works on small divisors [1], from Brjuno’s on differential
equations[16] and fromCherry’son the iterateswithindifferentmultiplier[27].
This short list indicates the real number of few isolated productions, scattered
through the Time and concerning of continuous systems governed by analytic
differential equations. They indirectly tie to iterated complex maps: in fact
these two ﬁelds were already known to keep lots of aﬃnities in general. The
indifferent dynamics were rather sleepy until late 1980s, except for few works

by the French [48, 61, 62] and by the Russian school [67, 95], where authors
attacked the problem in local terms, discussing on the linearization conditions
and on the Siegel disc propertiesS.
A third stage begun when one radically new look was brought in during
1990s: specialists
5
realized that the numerical nature of θ not just affects the
Siegel disc size – locally speaking – but even the topology of the Julia set J
θ
at a larger view. The theory of hedgehogs roots into the investigation on the
dynamical and geometrical properties of∂S and of J
θ
, featuring what follows.
(1
◦
)Becausethelocallinearizationandtheexistencetheoremswerealready
clear in general, the study of the properties for the argument θ naturally fol-
lowed as one further elaboration of the former results. This topic became one
dominant trend during the new wave. One notices that the complex iterated
mapf(z) was studied as a polynomial exclusively and in the form (1.1.5). The
latter can be regarded as a Taylor series and it can still (and at best) support
the study of the extended version of an older problem (to be explained in the
nextsections); orequivalently,specialistslookedoutatanewer,biggerproblem
keeping the same local features as of the original and more restricted version,
since when it was formulated (back in late 1910s). Here the Diophantine order
of θ and the metrics of Siegel discs are concerned.
(2
◦
) On another side, the new trend started to extend the investigation to
the semi–local scope: this means to drop the solely local analysis of the Siegel
disc and to investigate on the Julia set J
θ
too. In view of (1
◦
), it seems that
one shall exclude the linear term from the Taylorseries and consider the higher
orders terms. Anyway it is not a correct view: the Taylor series are obsolete
to work on problems of not exclusively local scope. Tools were naturallyforged
elsewhere: in the realms of Topology and of Number Theory, the closest ﬁelds
to the essence of the problem. Here the dynamics and the geometries of Julia
sets J
θ
are discussed.
To summarize, the discoveries showed that the numerical properties of θ

were termed hedgehogs.
1.2 The hedgehogs
In the Holomorphic Dynamics, the ‘hedgehog’ is nowadays the expression col-
lecting the familyH ofJ
θ
whenθ∈R\Q. Equivalently, it is the visual version
which resumes all the semi–localdynamics in the irrationalcase. The theoryof
hedgehogs does not replace the older center-problem, but it extends the latter
in the same terms as in the previous two points.
Thecenter-problemwasintroducedduringtheearlieststudiesontheglobal
dynamics for complex rational maps all over the Riemann sphere, i.e. inside
the independent works by Fatou and by Julia during 1906–1920. At the eyes
of these two pioneers, it immediately showed as a very hasch question. His-
tory tells that Fatou’s and Julia’s false positions did not only root to their
lack of background
6
, but there were intrinsic diﬃculties in grasping an overall
view because several essential concepts were not clear to them yet. Scratch by
scratch,diﬃcultieshavebeenslowlyremovedduringthelaterdecades, untilthe
core became visible in the recent years. These events had been showing that
an interdisciplinary approach, joining Topology, Analysis and Number Theory,
was strongly required. The introduction of the term ‘center’ by Julia was like-
wise imitated by Cremer, who coined the opposite expression non-center and a
number of derived terms, in order to have at hand a basis of preliminary con-
cepts to discuss the opposite side of the question. The center-problem original
statement discards the case of the geometries and the neighboring dynamics
when (1.1.6) does not hold and centers do not exist. But, alike the center-
problem, this counterpart also requires the combined approach via Number
Theory and Topology. Equivalently to Cremer’s terms, we call this counter-
part as the non-center-problem [28]. This is the point break with the theory of
continuous systems and ordinary differential equations, where the non-center
situation cannot happen.
Following Cremer’s production, the only paper on non-centers was written
by T. M. Cherry in 1964 [27], where a geometrical object – whose topology

Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 19Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
was very similar to modern hedgehogs – was sketched out. One shall wait until
the early1990sfor seeing moremathematicalworkson non-centers, illustrating
the new theory of hedgehogs as the modern way to approach, resume and solve
deﬁnitely the center-problem. It was grabbed and placed where deserved: just
as a dot inside one bigger puzzle! Hedgehogs in fact delivered a corpus of
concepts for watching all irrational dynamics coherently, where the rational
and irrational dynamics are tied together [73].
Forwhatcanbeknownabouttheiteratesofpolynomials(1.1.5), hedgehogs
relateS to J
θ
, classifyingS into 3 types, differing for the numerical properties
of θ and for the radiusr of the discS. The range of r is as follows:
1
◦
) the maximal value R, so r =R;
2
◦
) non-maximal r, when 0<r<R;
3
◦
) the null value, when r = 0.
As r shrinks from R to 0, J
θ
wedges into the bounded basin. There is no
wedging action in 1
◦
) and it is maximal in 3
◦
) when δ ∈ J
θ
is a non-center
and termed today as Cremer point: the two-fold nature of this theory gets
clearer as one runs this list backwards from 3
◦
) to 1
◦
) in terms of linearization
regions or, from 1
◦
) to 3
◦
), in terms of hedgehogs if the rate of wedging action
is accounted: the Hausdorff dimension of Julia sets goes way up to 2 as r
decreases to 0. The cases 1
◦
) and 2
◦
) involve linearizable hedgehogs, while the
non-linearizable type belongs to 3
◦
). If the linearization region is maximal,S
is a Siegel disc; otherwise these smaller discs are deﬁned Siegel compacta ([73],
p. 245).
Despite the powerof coveringall subcases inindifferent dynamics, we opine
that the theory of hedgehogs did not get to the mature stage yet. We mean to
the sense of most results based upon the dynamics of polynomials exclusively.
This could still stand a restriction. As we will remark in the closing sections
of this work, one further advancement could want to ‘get back’ to the original
terms: the rational maps R(z) with indifferent points. The dynamics of R(z)
should be directly investigated at the semi-local scope, searching out of the
Siegel disc S and moving towards the Julia set. The promising results on the
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 20Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
hedgehogs for the iterates of polynomials (1.1.5) already suggested that the
Schr¨ oder’s functional equation (1.1.6) is no longer useful outside∂S.
Question 1.2.1. Could a full picture of hedgehogs geometries be taken from the
study of the iterated polynomials exclusively? Would it more adequate to study
thesingularitiesdistributionfora generalrationalmapR(z)andto knowif such
latter points exist and how they could affect these geometries? For example to
know whether they [do not] spread radially along privileged directions? How
many and where?
Thesearejustquestions, perhapsindicationsforfurtherresearches, notdis-
cussed herebut just hinted. The goalof thisarticleis to deepen themathemat-
ical meaning of some results that already appeared in [83] but were developed
in terms of graphics exclusively.
1.3 The problem of drawing hedgehogs
We areﬁrst interestedin understandingifcomputersmaycapture, and at what
degree, the shapes ofH. While (1
◦
) is trivial, the display of cases (2
◦
) or (3
◦
)
getsmuchharder,duetothedelicate numerical properties ofθ∈R\Q, together
with machine approximation and the slow convergence speed in each type of
indifferent dynamics. Both aspects drastically slow down the performance of
most graphical methods: these are clear evidences that they do not ﬁt in such
dynamics. Not surprising anyway, since they had originally been developed for
particular shapes of Julia sets.
7
The global character of these (widespread)
methods collides with the local dynamics around Siegel compacta.
So we are long for new strategies. Old methods may work suﬃciently ﬁne
for rational dynamics when θ ∈Q. But, when θ ∈R\Q, the efforts to obtain
ﬁne drawings of J
θ
require to be customized.
A ﬁrst question of interest was to know whether and how a detailed display

candidatemethodshallnottakeintoaccounttheconvergenceorthedivergence.
One way to crack this problem was suggested in [83]. It is especially useful
while dealing with case (2
◦
) when the Siegel radius is non-maximal and when
θ ∈ Q. This method is not free from ﬂaws: ﬁgures 1.3.1 include white discs
pointing out to a lack of accuracy. On the other hand, it runs faster: if com-
pared to the aforementionedmethods, the gap is signiﬁcant. Results show that
the hedgehogs topology gets clearer as well as its wedging action inside the
bounded basin. Our original goal was to offer a strategy for drawing pictures
regardingthe indifferent dynamics througha exhaustiveset of parameters. De-
spite such detailed results, this is not a total victory, because our method still
enjoys a same ﬂaw as most of the known methods: the impossibilityof drawing
theextremalcaseofnon-linearizablehedgehogs. Thefeelingofreachingsoclose
to it let us wonder if, rather than how (like we did before). It was then natu-
ral to focus on a second question: are non-linearizable hedgehogs computable
8
? It is evident that the response demands a deeper analytical approach than
our achievements in [83], where only empirical methods were applied. Just as

progressively increasing number of iterates, this method emphasizes the wedging action inside the
bounded Fatou component. White discs acknowledge the lack of accuracy in the visual reproduction
of the geometry: a side effect from the main feature which allows the method to be very fast.
anticipation here, we sketch out that the response is negative: the characters
of irrational dynamics depend on delicate numerical conditions and computers

can just approximate them. Although this latter statement is quite obviously
true, the approach we followed begun a proliﬁc discussion on Diophantine Ap-

2 Gathering the required background
In the next two sections we will sketch out some background concepts from
the Measure Theory, Diophantine Approximations and Topology. Where re-
quired, some additional concepts will be developed as well, in order to have
the appropriate tools for the ﬁnal proof. The reader is directed to the books
[40, 35, 53, 58, 64] for prerequisite background information not provided here.
2.1 Diophantine and Liouville irrationals
Let
R(z) =
m(z)

) = 0,
be a complex rational map. R(z) is the quotient of two non-zero polynomials
with rational coeﬃcients, so that
deg(R(z)) = max{deg(m),deg(n)}≥ 2.
In [28], where the dynamics of the iterates R
n
(z) about an irrationally indif-
ferent ﬁxed point δ are investigated, Hubert Cremer showed that the closed
unit intervalI ≡ [0,1]includes a zero Lebesgue measure set of irrationalvalues
α, not allowing the conjugation of R
n
(z) into the holomorphic germ (1.1.5),

thus obstructing the local linearization R

around δ. Topologi-
cally, there exists no neighborhoodU ⊃δ, centered atδ and being conformally
isomorphic to a disk under R
n
(z). We say that α ∈ R\Q is a Siegel value
[Cremer value] if the linearization applies [does not apply] and call δ a Siegel
point [Cremer point]. Long before Cremer’s 1927 paper [28], Joseph Liouville
(1844) showed that α may ‘resist’, more or less strongly, their approximation
by sequences of rational numbers p
n
/q
n
. This strength is rated by an integer
valueκ in the following Diophantine condition:

, ∀κ≥ 2 κ∈Z

. (2.1.1)
(A reﬁned version, to be applied to other problems in Number Theory, wants
κ∈R.) This condition is satisﬁed by Siegel values. At this point, for sake of
comfort, we remanage the standard operator for deﬁning the closest integer p
to qα (check Lang’s book [58] for original usage). Let kq
n
αk be the left-hand
side of the inequality (2.1.1):
kq

;
if α satisﬁes (2.1.1), α is a Diophantine irrational and it can be classiﬁed by
the orderκ< +∞, α∈D(κ). Given a non-zero polynomial of ﬁnite degreeκ,

α is algebraic of order κ for P

(α) = 0 holds, given infκ < +∞. Liouville
applied the remarkable formula (2.1.1) to retrieve an equivalent deﬁnition for
algebraic numbers in terms of rational approximations: in fact, the expressions
‘Algebraic’ and ‘Diophantine’ mean the same in this context. There exists a
class of irrationals, the transcendental numbers, which are not algebraic, so not
the solutions of any such polynomialP
κ
(x).
Now letD(2) be Diophantine irrationals of quadratic order, then

is the topological representation for Diophantine irrationals of order κ > 2.
One knows thatD(2+) andD(∞) are of full Lebesgue measure ([64], pp. 120,
222).
11
These two classes of irrationals play a special role in the theory of
Diophantine Approximations. Surprisingly
12
D(∞) is not analogously applied
to Diophantine irrationals of inﬁnite order, but it is deﬁned as
D(∞)≡
[
k<+∞
D(κ) (2.1.3)
i.e. the union set of all Diophantine numbers of any orderκ, according to this
nesting rule ([64], p. 222):
D(m)⊂D(n), 2≤m<n< +∞. (2.1.4)
The setL≡R\(Q∪D(∞))of Liouville numbers is thecomplementofD(∞) in
R\Q and consists of the Cremer values not satisfying (2.1.1). One knows that
L has zero Hausdorff dimension ([64], p. 222):
13
Lemma 2.1.1. The setR\D(κ) has Hausdorff dimension≤ 2/κ. Hence the setL
of Liouville numbers has zero Hausdorff dimension.

2.2 Khintchine’s theorems
Thesensefromthewholecorpusofthepreviousresultsjustgrantstheexistence
of sequences of rational approximants to algebraic irrationals α of arbitrarily
large order κ, but cannot give any information on how or if one can reach
α. We move the focus from α to the behavior of the sequence p
n
/q
n
. Several
results were developed in this direction. We ﬁrst mention two metric theorems
by Khintchine, termed as Khintchine’s convergence and divergence theorems
respectively, concerning of the interesting property 2 of theorem 2.5.1 (p. 31)
([52, 53], cf. [58], pp. 23–24):
11
Check the deﬁnition of Lebesgue measure at p. 35.
12
We keep this deﬁnition until sharper results will be shown, where the ambiguous symbol∞ is replaced by
the least transﬁnite ordinal ω
0
. The development of a proper and more extensive environment will lessen this
exception, letting it match the original meaning.

Theorem 2.2.1 (Khintchine’s Convergence Theorem). Let ψ be a positive function such
that
∞
X
q=1
ψ(q)
converges. Then for almost all numbers α (i.e. outside a set of zero Lebesgue
measure), there is only a ﬁnite number of solutions to the inequality
kqαk<
ψ(q)
q
. (2.2.1)
Theorem 2.2.2 (Khintchine’s Divergence Theorem). Let ψ be a positive function such
that
∞
X
q=1
ψ(q)
diverges. Then for almost all numbers α, there are inﬁnitely many solutions to
the inequalitykqαk<
ψ(q)
q
.
The terms ‘convergence’ and ‘divergence’ refer to functions which converge
asymptotically to a ﬁnite bounded value and to∞ respectively.
These two Khintchine’s theorems are based upon the boolean-like perfor-
mance through ‘convergence-divergence’, intuitively setting up the existence of
one threshold value for determining if the inequality (2.2.1) has ﬁnitely or in-
ﬁnitely many solutions. These theorems portray the early and rough status
of the metric Theory of Numbers before the achievements by Roth and alia.
The information retrieved here are insuﬃcient to allow any direct contact with
Diophantine-Liouvilledichotomy: for example, theorem 2.2.1 may allude to Li-
ouville numbers (because of the zero measure set), while 2.2.2 cannot help to
determine if the values in question are Diophantine or Liouville. From merging
theorems together, one can ﬁnd out a ‘strip of doubt’ close toα and where one
cannot determine exactly if solutions are ﬁnitely or inﬁnitely many. Despite
these comments and ﬂaws in metric terms, we will make some observations
about the sequences of approximantsp

2.3 A ﬁrst look on the sequences of approximants
With regard to these Khintchine’s theorems, let q > 1. If
P

q=1
ψ(q) diverges
[converges], ψ(q)/q diverges [converges]. Let deg(f) be the degree of the func-
tionf in parentheses.
From ψ(q)
1
q
, 1/q → 0 as q grows: so the convergence and divergence of
ψ(q)/q involve the growth order of ψ(q), because of deg(
1
q
) = log
q

q
) =−1 is
constant. With no loss of generality,
14
let ψ(q) :aq
n
,n∈Z and log
q
ψ(q) =n.
Let deg(ψ(q)) ≡ log
q
ψ(q), we will ﬁrst discuss the exponents n, when a is
constant. Let the maximum operator:

, (2.3.1)
which becomes
M
ψ
= max{|log

ψ(q)|,1} or M
ψ
= max{log
q
ψ(q),−1}.
According to (2.3.1), we ﬁnd thatM
ψ
=|log
q
ψ(q)| holds when:
1. log
q
ψ(q) =n≥ 2. In fact, given

where deg(P(q)) = n. From our usage of the maximal operator, one sees that the conclusions of this section
depend on the value n of the largest exponent, thus from the monomialaq

ψ(q) as a general Taylor series, opening to the cases of a polynomial or transcendentalψ(q).

the discussion moves to the parameter a: in fact, ψ(q)/q ≡ a. Given

P

q=1
ψ(q) diverges; otherwise, if log
a
(a) < 1,
P

converges;
4. Finally, one might like to discuss a and n simultaneously. This is easy as
ψ(q)

ψ(q)
q
is constant.
Khintchine’s theorems assume that the sequence of q
i
is a priori determined,
q
i
= 1,2,3,..., according to the sum operator
P

q=1
. These sequences are
trivialanywayand we aremostlyinterestedin studying the general case, where
there exists a map q

= φ(q
i
). Here we focus on the coeﬃcient a or on the
exponent n of φ: both elements govern the approximation rate.
2.4 On the strip of doubt
According to section 2.3, it seems that a general discussion on the behavior
of the map ψ(q) should take into account either its speed of convergence [of
divergence]. But the rational form of ψ(q)/q brings in one more delicate dis-
cussion, involving the combinations resulting from a comparison between the
growing [shrinking] rates of the mapψ(q) at the numerator and of the identity
map q at the denominator; except when both maps shrink and the resulting
ψ(q)/q shrinkstoo, the two speed ratesshall be comparedso thatψ(q)/q grows
[shrinks] as their algebraic sum is positive [negative]. The Khintchine’s two
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 28Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
theorems represent the natural environment for this discussion. In fact, the
different speed rates of the numerator ψ(q) and the denominator q affect the
convergence and the divergence ofψ(q)/q and thus may require the application
of theorem 2.2.1 or 2.2.2, where required. Our goal is to set up one scenario
where these two theoremsarecomplementaryin topologicalterms, so to havea
combinedversion. Onesuchnew statementmaybe evenweaker,because ofthe
behavior would depend on the sequence q
n
as well as on the map ψ(q). Frac-
tions with different speed rates in the numerator and in the denominator may
give rise to a larger number of cases than we need. So we set some restrictions
to ψ(q), for crunching that number to only one which ﬁts our purposes.
Let ψ(q
n
) : N → R be a convergent sequence. Let q
n
= 1,2,... and
c,k6=∞, wherec,k∈R, are constants. Consequently,
ψ(q
n
)→c ⇒
∞
X
q
n
=1
ψ(q
n
)→k6=∞.
It is not intended that we have convergence for all q > 0. Now suppose the
hypotheses of the two theorems hold simultaneously for a same rational map
ψ(q
n
)/q
n
. Loosely speaking, there may exist one or more values of q
n
such
that ψ(q
n
)/q
n
may diverge or not. So one can speak of one domain R
C
of
convergence and oneR
D
of divergence. Asn = 1,2,3,..., the denominatorsq
n
increase suﬃciently fast that we have
liminf
ψ(q

The two theorems under consideration imply that kqαk → 0. Let the triplet
of points q
s
≤ q
s+1
≤ q
s+2
be a subsequence of q
n
so that s ∈ N (N = {n ∈
N : 1,2,3,...}) with the (here, purely artiﬁcial) condition that no couple of
points q

belong to a same domain R
C
or to R

or to the boundary R

two different regions. Let q

belong to the region of divergence and
convergence, respectively, whileq

Some have been crucial in the historical development of Diophantine Ap-
proximations. They will be considered later again here, to elucidate our main
problem and to ground the further results.
2.5 On the accessibility to Liouville numbers
According to the theory of Diophantine Approximations, one special class in-
cludes the algebraic irrationalsof constant type (equivalently, of bounded type),
enjoying these two
16
equivalent properties ([58], p. 24):
Theorem 2.5.1. Given an algebraic irrational α of constant type:
1. There exists a constantǫ> 0 such that (2.1.1) holds for all integersq
n
> 0
and κ = 2.
2. For any positive function ψ with convergent sum
P
ψ(q
n
), the inequality
kq
n
αk<ψ(q
n
)/q
n
has only a ﬁnite number of solutions.
From property 1 one understands the reason why the expression Diophantine
irrationals of constanttype referstoD(2),theirrationalsofquadraticorder. On
the contrary, Liouville numbers θ satisfy this complimentary formula instead:
16
More equivalent properties could be listed. But were omitted because these listed ones best ﬁt the sense of
our discussion.

givenp,q∈N wheregcd(p,q) = 1 andǫ> 0, then
liminfkqαk≤

, ∀κ≥ 2. (2.5.1)
Liouville numbers are transcendental (the converse does not hold). The previ-
ous discussion introduced the existence of a Diophantine-Liouville dichotomy,
coming straight from the so-called Liouville’s approximation theorem:
Theorem 2.5.2 (Liouville’s approximation theorem). Let α be any algebraic number of
ﬁnite order κ≥ 2. Then there exists a positive constantǫ =c(α) [

DiophantineandLiouvillenumbersdifferifthelowerboundfortheinﬁnites-
imalǫ maybe positiveor vanish identically, if (2.5.2)holds or not, respectively.
This sets a break-point for the Diophantine-Liouville dichotomy. There is also
one such split for Diophantine irrationals, between D(2) and D(2+): while
property 2 of theorem 2.5.1 always holds for D(2+), it holds for D(2) only if
the denominatorsq
n
meet one condition, discussed below.
One such generalization for D(2+) was shown during the mid 1950s and
represents one of the most intriguing results in Diophantine Approximations.

with ǫ> 0.

18
K. F. Roth was awarded a Fields medal in 1958 for this result.
19
There is still much to learn. All the later production after Liouville’s theorem lacked of non-effectiveness,
because the related methods of proof do not make it possible to determine how ǫ can be computed from α.
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 32Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
From theorem (2.5.3), Roth deduced the existence of a least upper bound
μ(α) ≡ inf
μ∈R
μ, called irrationality measure
20
, indicating how closely α can be
well-approximated by p
n
/q
n
. The value μ(α) plays as a threshold for kq
n
αk,
inviting to focus on this version of the above inequality:
kq
n
αk<
1
q
μ(α)
n
. (2.5.3)
Hopefully, comparing (2.5.3) to Roth’s theorem will not confuse the reader:
κ and μ(α) do not keep the same meaning. The operator μ(α) indicates the
upper bound to be taken on by κ for a neighborhood of α to include inﬁnitely
or ﬁnitely many solutions of (2.5.1). If κ < μ(α), there exist inﬁnitely many
solutionsinsideaneighborhoodofαandconvergingarbitrarily close toα,which
is said well-approximable. Otherwise, solutions are ﬁnitely many for κ>μ(α):
one such number cannot guarantee arbitrarily close convergence to α, which is
thusabadly approximable value. Theexistenceofinﬁnitelymanyapproximants
p

/q

, togetherwiththeirequi-distribution

are necessary conditions for assuming that approximants may get arbitrarily
close to α.
Rothfound a strikingclassiﬁcationofall realsinto threecategories: μ(α) =
1 if α∈Q, μ(α) = 2 if α∈D(κ) for κ≥ 2 and μ(α)> 2 if α∈L. According
to Roth’s sense, while any neighborhood of D(2) and D(2+), with smaller
radius than 1/q
2+ǫ
, cannot include inﬁnitely many rational approximants, the
unbounded interval μ(α) > 2 indicates the inﬁnite irrationality measure of
Liouville numbers. Roth gave a deﬁnitive response to the natural question
arising from some weak theorems in Number Theory (see for example, section
2.4). Thus μ(θ) cannot be exceeded by ﬁnite κ and Liouville numbers are
well-approximable. Reaching to θ via sequences of rational approximants with
arbitrarily sharp precision is effective. We can equivalently state that:
Proposition 2.5.1. For every θ ∈ L, there exist arbitrarily small neighborhoods
U(θ)ofθ suchthatU(θ)containssolutionsof (2.5.1)thataccumulatearbitrarily
close to θ.

Roth’s classiﬁcation helps to earn the global understanding of several results,
developed years before into separate theorems, but not arranged into a system-
atic corpus yet. One of them is this classic theorem ([68], p. 95):
Theorem2.5.4. Given any irrational numberα, there are inﬁnitely many rational
numbers

From elementary calculus, one ﬁnds that (2.5.4) can be rewritten as follows:
kq

. (2.5.5)
According to Roth’s theorem (p. 32), h ≤ 2 +ǫ relates to inﬁnitely many
solutions of (2.5.5) for the algebraic α. The estimation of the bounding de-
nominatorvaluein theright-handside of (2.5.5)wassharpened bythe Hurwitz
theorem (cf. [50]), stating:
Theorem 2.5.5 (Hurwitz’s theorem). Let α ∈ R\Q and A be a constant satisfying

The optimality

inﬁnitely many solutions, stands out as another intriguing result: for A>
√
5,
one ﬁnds ﬁnitely many solutions of the above inequality, according to Roth’s
theorem. Hurwitz’s theorem ﬁts the same sense as of the questions concluding
the section 2.4. As Roth’s and Hurwitz’s theorems melt together, one can
check the conditions met by q

for knowing how many approximants converge
arbitrarily close to θ. Applying the notation of Roth’s theorem, one writes

2.6 Background on regular sets
WetakeashortbreakfromDiophantineApproximationsandmovetoTopology.
We focus on some concepts in Measure Theory. LetE⊂R. SinceR is a metric
space, we introduce the following theorem ([59], p. 5):
Theorem 2.6.1. Every non-empty open set E∈R can be uniquely expressed as a
ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite union of pairwise disjoint open intervals.

model based upon a more general construction of sequences of sets E
h
.
Borelﬁrstgavethedeﬁnitionoftheregular setRofpointsbelongingto
T
E
h
(h = 1,2,...). He distinguished the role of R from the pointwise fundamental
set F of limit points, ([11], pp. 2 and 5) for the sequence E
h
. Unlike Lebesgue,
Borel did not require E
h
to be pairwise disjoint (see proposition 2.6.1: Borel’s
deﬁnition requires the intersection of E
h
to be non-empty). He also developed
this model for limit sets F of any countability: following the early version
where F was countable (Ch. I, p. 2), Borel extended F to any countability
with inﬁnitely many or even uncountably many points (Ch. III, pp. 14–15).
More explicitly, Borel stated ([11], p. 2):

, here depicted as discs. They may also be segments, squares or any geometrical entity which is
nestable. Convergence is not required to be uniform (A) or running inwards (B-C): it may also run
outwards (D).
Proposition 2.6.1. The set E of interior points for all E
h
(h = 1,2,...) is reg-
ular (evidently of zero Lebesgue measure). Every set of zero Lebesgue measure
belongs to a regular set.
Since L is of zero measure, it can be reached via regular sets. This latter
modelcouldretrievefundamentalsetswithdifferenttopologies,accordingtothe
initial conditions: for example, the nature of the sequence Γ of the indexesh or
the countability ofF. If Γ is bounded from above (limsuph≤i,0<i< +∞),
23
In a vaguely polemical footnote, Borel claimed the independent authorship of such concepts and attested
that the ‘zero Lebesgue measure’ deﬁnition became more popular than to the expression he coined: ‘null sets’.
See [11], p. 1.
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 36Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
the regular set is not necessarily of zero measure nor could it be the same as
its limit set. So R≡E≡F may not necessarily hold for this model.
2.7 Independence of the regular sets model
We now return to Diophantine approximationand discuss another basic result,
which follows from lemma 2.1.1 ([64], p. 223):
Lemma 2.7.1. The set D(2) of Diophantine numbers of constant type has zero
Lebesgue measure.
From (2.1.4), one notices that the set of Diophantine numbers of order m
enjoys a cumulative deﬁnition, due to the inclusionof subsets of order 2≤m<
+∞ ([64], p. 222):
D(m) =
[
κ≤m
D(κ).
Now we introduce the set of Diophantine irrationalsof strict order m, i.e. with
order κ =m. Given 2≤κ<m, this deﬁnition reformulates into
D[m] =
[
κ≤m
D(κ)\
[
κ≤(m−1)
D(κ),
and the above lemma generalizes as follows ([64], p. 225):
Lemma 2.7.2. Every set D[κ] of Diophantine numbers of strict order κ has zero
Lebesgue measure and positive Hausdorff dimension.
Proof. According to classic Diophantine Analysis, the deﬁnition (2.1.1) of a
Diophantine irrationalθ of order m implies that θ does not belong to a union
of intervals of diameters 2ǫ/q
m
(refer to ﬁg. 3.2.1). Likewise the class of Dio-
phantine ζ of order m− 1, does not belong to a union of intervals of length
2ǫ/q
m−1
. Finally the Diophantine irrationalsθ of strict order m do not belong
to the interval of width

tending to 0 for ǫ > 0. So there exists a sequence of decreasing and positive
widths and thus of inﬁnitely many nested sets: it follows readily that every set
D[m] of strict order m < +∞ has zero Lebesgue measure. The limit (2.1.1)
never vanishes identically. Hence every setD[m] has positive Hausdorff dimen-
sion.
Followingthepreviouslemma2.7.2andourpreviousdiscussiononLiouville
numbers, we can deﬁnitely apply the notion of regular sets to Diophantine
irrationals of any strict orderκ:
Proposition 2.7.1. Diophantine irrationals of any strict order κ< +∞ can be set
as fundamental points of the limit set F in the regular sets model.
2.8 Hunting with Liouville and Hausdorff
In the end of section 2.1, we quoted a lemma stating that the s-dimensional
Hausdorff dimension H
s
(E) of a set E is 0. We will go over the deﬁnition of
H
s
(E), in order to settle the analogy between the regular sets model and the
set of Liouville numbers. Let (X,d) be a metric space. Given E ⊂ X, the
diameter and the radius ofE is deﬁned as follows:
diam(E) := sup
x,y∈E
d(x,y), radius(E) :=
diam(E)
2
, (2.8.1)
whered(x,y) is the distance between two pointsx,y∈E. Let the operator

follows:
H

+
H

(E). (2.8.3)
Inordertomeetthetopologicalandmetricconditions(2.8.1)forcomputingthe
Hausdorff dimension ofL, we illustrate some concepts involving the Hausdorff
measure ﬁrst. Let E ≡L and X ≡R, in fact L ⊂R and R is endowed with

the Euclidean metric. The deﬁnition of s-dimensional Hausdorff measure can
be applied to L via regular sets E
n
. The lower bound of (2.8.2) is again 0 if
one rewrites it into:
H

δ
(E) = inf

= 0.
(2.8.4)
With regard to the Liouville model, where E
n
are nested discs, all centered
at θ and whose radius is the distance from the Liouville θ to p
n
/q
n
, the n
th

convergentlocatedon∂E

(see ﬁg. 3.2.1). So we can merge (3.2.3)with(2.8.4)
and obtain this new version of the latter:

; (2.8.5)
it turns out that the Hausdorff measure ofL is 0 according to the limit (2.5.1)
which holds at each point ofL:
H

The deﬁnition of Hausdorff dimensiond

is in general as follows,
d
H
(E) = inf{s|H
s
(E) = 0} or d
H
(E) = sup{s|H
s
(E) =∞}. (2.8.7)
The formula (2.8.6) satisﬁes the left-hand side of (2.8.7), so that the second
part of lemma 2.1.1 at p. 25 can be restated:
Theorem 2.8.1. The Hausdorff dimension d
H
of set L⊂R of Liouville numbers
θ is zero: d
H
(L) = 0.
From (2.8.5) and the theory of regular sets, E
n
→ E ≡ L. For theorem
2.8.1, L consists of isolated points and it is totally disconnected. There is a
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 39Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
respected and wide literature aboutL (belonging to the most general family of
Cantor-likesets). See[70]byOlsenandRenfrofordeeperresultsonthemetrics
ofL: the dimension functions there introduced show thatL enjoys the curious
property of not having a positive ﬁnite measure relative to any generalized
Hausdorff measure. We also suggest the joint works by Cabrelli, Molter at Alia
[22, 23, 24, 41]. With no loss of generality, our discussion gets easier if just
one sequence of E
n
, converging to one limit point θ ∈ E, is assumed at once:
approximating one Liouville number ﬁnds to be analogous to the regular sets
convergence towards a totally disconnected limit set (see table 2.8).
3 Towards the equivalence of models
Inthissectionwedeepentheanalogiesbetweenthetopologicalmodelofregular
sets and the Liouville numbers deﬁnition.
3.1 Faster than polynomials
Both Q and R\Q are dense. Since D(∞) ⊂ R\Q is of full Lebesgue measure
onI ≡ [0,1] ([64], p. 120), it is also dense inR; soL≡R\(Q∪D(∞)) is co-
dense inR. From Transcendental Numbers Theory,L⊂R is everywhere-dense
set. Because of D(∞) is the complement of a zero measure set and L is the
complement of a ﬁrst category set, each set has the cardinality of continuum
in every interval of R. So L is uncountable too. In terms of regular sets, the
second question we posed at p. 22 amounts to inquiring about the possibility
of moving along the sequence of nested sets E
h
up to E≡L. It comes natural
to wonder
Question 3.1.1. What are the conditions governing the possibility of ﬁnding a
sequence of nested sets E
h
which converge to the zero measure set E of funda-
mental points, so that E≡F ≡X\
S
E
h
holds?
We ﬁrst need to recall this theorem obtained by Paul du Bois-Reymond in
his researches on convergent and on divergent series ([33], Ch. IV or [11], p. 16
and [38]):
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 40Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
Theorem 3.1.1 (du-Bois Reymond). Given a sequence of positive and monotonically
increasing functions ϕ
h
(n) of polynomial type, h → ∞,n ∈ N
+
at arbitrarily
high speed, there always exists another such function ϕ(n) growing faster than
the sequence ϕ
h
(n).
Owing to its monotonicand increasing behavior,ϕ is order-preserving (iso-
tone) and ϕ : R → R. Now we can exploit the shrinking sequence of nested
sets in the regular sets model. Consider the exterior of the discs in ﬁg. 3.2.1:
this is the sequence of pairwise disjoint sets E
h
for h = 1,2,..., called exclu-
sion sets; analogously, if the interior is assumed, we speak of inclusion sets I
h
(depicted in shades of grey). From this same ﬁgure, the visual analogy with
concepts in Diophantine Approximations is straightforward. We can drop the
LebesgueassumptionthatE

≡∅andget closetoBorel’smoreintuitive
viewpoint:
E≡F ≡X\
[
E
h
≡
\
h=1,2,...
I
h
.
Inclusion sets can be restated as the intersection I ≡
\
h=1,2,...
I
n
, while exclusion
sets are the union E≡
[
h=1,2,...
E
n
; the actions of inclusion sets and of exclusion
sets suggest the approximation rules followed by classes of Liouville numbers
and the topology of Diophantine irrationals of different order κ respectively.
According to theorem 3.1.1, there are no ﬁnite upper bounds for the speed of
the familyP of polynomialsϕ(n): given any subfamily ofP and whose speed is
rated by a ﬁnite ordinal |s
h
|< +∞, one can ﬁnd another such subfamilywhose
speed is rated by a ﬁnite ordinal |s
h+1
| > |s
h
|. Along with the polynomial
formula
P
k
i=0
a
i
x
i
, one understands that s
h
is determined by the magnitude
of the coeﬃcients a
i
. This reinforces the “relative” character of polynomial
speed, because faster and faster rates whena
i
are arbitrarilylarge ordinals but
of ﬁnite magnitude. In the next few pages, we will investigate on the existence
of “absolutely fast” formulas. Because of the ‘ongoing’ construction of regular
sets, it is easy to apply the theorem 3.1.1, in order to deduce the following:
Corollary 3.1.2. Let|s
1
| be the speed rate for shrinking, nested sequence of exclu-
sion sets E
h
1
. There exists another sequence E
h
2
with speed rate|s

which decreases faster. In general, one has

(3.1.3)
holds for an a priori determined sequence of indexes n or, equivalently, for a
sequence of functions ϕ

(we need to go over the nature of ϕ
h
and investigate
their coeﬃcients, according to the remarks in section 2.3).
The polynomial ϕ
h
is the so-called approximation function (see [30], p.
14) and θ is ϕ-approximable. After the discussion about d
H
(L) = 0, we will
strengthen the connection between the metrics ofL and the regular sets model
via Khintchine’s theorems (p. 26). Linking the relations (3.1.1) and (3.1.3)
together with (2.2.1), the regular sets model leads back again to Khintchine’s
theorems and to this formula approximating the Liouville numbers:

in (3.1.3) for the regular sets model (which is assumed to converge). In these
new terms, we turned the problem of reaching θ∈L via rational approximants
into the equivalent investigation on the nature of the functions ϕ
h
. While the

ψ(q) is assumed to deal with one a priori determined sequence of

The relation(3.1.4)comes straight from the followingtheorem (cf. [58], p. 21):
Theorem 3.1.3. Let{p

and let ϕ be an increasing function≥ 1, such that for all n suﬃciently large,

Then α is said to be ‘of type≤ϕ’.
The type ≤ϕ refers to the existence of a solution of the inequalitykqαk<

Theϕ-sequenceϕ

remarks, and can be intended as different viewpoints on the approximation of
Liouvillenumbers, accordingtotheconsequencesfromKhintchine’stheoremat

The meaning of 3.1.7 is two-fold: ﬁrst it shows that the left fractions shall

of the sequence {q

via the growing factorsq

which shall be maximal, or via the approximating
function ϕ acting as the fastest one. We will later discuss the details of these
two conclusions. According to the previous remarks on non-effectiveness (p.

In terms of indexed sequences,
Question 3.1.2. Does it make sense to admit the existence of a maximal index n
so that (1) ≤ 0 and the sequence stops, (2) ǫ = 0 because of the magnitude of
q
n
and (3) θ∈L is ﬁnally reached by p
n

n
?
Before attacking this question, we show that the proposition 2.5.1 at p. 33
holds: there exist inﬁnitely many solutions of (2.5.1) and which get arbitrarily
close to a Liouville number θ. The ‘arbitrary closeness’ property cannot apply
to Diophantine irrationals, because of (2.1.1).
Given the index set I, let {S
i
: i ∈ I} be the collection of intervals such
that the width of S

is kq

i
includes ﬁnitely many solutions of kqθk.
At the largest extent of their whole sequence, the approximants p

Through a later reﬁnement of concepts, we will come to a sharper and more

sets R are maximally dense in the sense of cardinality when F is also dense
([11], p. 15):
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 47Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
Proposition 4.1.1. Every regular set of zero measure, whose fundamental points
are dense in a domain, has the cardinality of the continuum. In other words, if
the decrease rate of the exclusion squares [
26
] around the fundamental points is
arbitrary, it is not possible for such decrease to be fast so that the fundamental
points are the only points of the set.
Refer to footnote 25. Because of the collection of fundamental points is co-
untable, Borel’s result implies that it is not possible for the decrease to be fast
enoughtoleaveonlythefundamentalpoints. Thecollectionofnon-fundamental

We canrestateitintermsofrationalapproximants:
Proposition 4.1.2. No decreasing sequence of regular sets that share the same set
of fundamental points can have an intersection (i.e. the limit of the regular
sets) that is equal to the set of fundamental points.
These remarks on how to not reach ∞ and on the possibility of reaching
θ ∈ L echo Borel’s words zero measure sets E ≡ F. After these two quite
not-so-promisingstatements,Borelopened to a possibility: he barelysuggested
that this goal can be only achieved via a ‘transﬁnite inﬁnity’ (in his original
terminology) of inclusion setsI
h
. The next sections are devoted to the sense of
this clue and to relateddevelopments, relying on remarks about approximating
functions which are faster than polynomials, in particular about the (multi-
)exponential speed, because of the double inequality (3.1.7).
4.2 Transﬁnite induction
Several remarkable results on well-ordered sets are collected into modern Set
Theory. The advancements during late XIXth century, inspired George Can-
tor to look far beyond countability and ﬁnite ordinals. Finally he built up a
robust corpus of rigorous concepts and contributed for Set Theory to be more
coherent. Cantor needed to trespass the frontier of ﬁnite numbers and came
to the concept of transﬁniteness, as coined by him. The early application was
26

Today we understand it as the fact that everyG

set that is dense in a domain has cardinality continuum
in every open disk contained in that domain.

to numbers, giving rise to the concept of transﬁnite values, i.e. cardinal or
ordinal numbers which are larger than all ﬁnite numbers and not necessarily
be absolutely inﬁnite: Cantor’s goal was in fact to deﬁne the largest numerical
nature which, unlike the inﬁnity concept, could share some of the well-known
computabilitypropertiesofﬁniteordinals,inordertorelyonasolidmathemat-
ical basis. transﬁniteness later involved relations and Logic: it is the so-called
procedure of transﬁnite induction, where the principle of induction extends to
well-ordered sets including transﬁnite elements:
Proposition 4.2.1 (Principle of induction). Let S be a well-ordered set, and A ⊆ S.
If y∈A for every y<x∈S, then x∈A.
Let S be a well-ordered set with maximal element x, so y <x for all x,y∈S.
If the property T(y) (say, ‘y belongs to the set A’) holds for all b < x, T(x)
(say, ‘x belongs to the set A’) holds too. Formally:
∀x(∀y(y<x⇒T(y))⇒T(x))⇒∀x(T(x)).
Extending a propertyT, from a well-ordered subsetA to the maximal element
of the related superset S, is a procedure of the three cases:
1. zero case: proving that T(0) holds, where 0 is the minimal element of a
well-ordered set.
2. successor case: proving that, given one ordinal y and its successor y +1,
where 0<y<y+1<...,T(y) holds andT(y+1), following fromT(y),
also holds. One notices the recursive character.
3. limit case: proving that for any limit ordinal γ, T(γ) holds and follows
fromT(y) for all y<γ.
Onespeaksoftransﬁniteinduction when,assumingthatbothzeroandsuccessor
cases apply to ﬁnite ordinals, the nature of the limit ordinal is transﬁnite.
4.3 transﬁniteness for Γ sequences
The relation (3.2.3) holds, depending on these special conditions:
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 49Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
1) iftheindexhis larger than any ﬁnite ordinal (intermsofamountofϕ
h
(n)
in the sequence);
2) or if the input variablen or the polynomialcoeﬃcients are larger than any
ﬁnite ordinal (in terms of the speed rate for each function elementϕ(n) in
the sequence).
We are going to focus on 1) now. Exploring the sequence Γ of approximating
functions involves a systematic study of the set of indexes h. As we look at
this condition from the operative viewpoint, i.e. at how the sequence works, it
is clear that we need to focus on the numerical nature of h, which affects the
approximation performance.
28
On the other hand, 2) belongs to the nature of
ϕ
h
(n), whose discussion will naturally follow after section 4.8.
Let h∈N be a ﬁnite and countable ordinal. We already know that (3.2.3)
cannot hold according to (3.2.2) and to proposition 4.1.2: θ ∈ L cannot be
reachedbyΓ. SinceLiouvillenumbersareaccessiblebytheapproximantsp

We showed that it makes sense to discusskqθk = 0 via liminfkqθk = 0, which
decreases inﬁnitesimally but never vanishes identically if h ∈ N. Inductively,
h is required to assume larger values than any ﬁnite ordinal, so to push Γ far
beyond the reach allowed by h ∈ N. One such role is played by transﬁnite
numbers – the extension of ﬁnite ordinals, as postulated by Cantor. In our
environment, we will deal with either ﬁnite and transﬁnite ordinals, assuming
they are both countable. Let O be the union set of ﬁnite ordinals with the
least transﬁnite ordinalω
0
: O≡N∪{ω
0
}. O is also countable.

Let the index

where h,n ≥ 0. From the hypotheses on the construction of Γ, (4.3.1) holds

Since min(h) = 0 and A is ordered by the relation ‘<’, A is a well-ordered set.

proposition in General Topology:
Proposition 4.3.1. Every well-ordered set is order isomorphic to a unique ordinal
number.
Given a well-ordered set A with maximal element at M
A
, there exists an
ordinal number counting the cardinality of A; but A is also zero-start by hy-
pothesis and Card(A)≡ max(h)≡h
k
holds. Recall the Axiom of Choice (AC)
([35], p. 8):
Proposition 4.3.2 (The Axiom of Choice). For every family {X

sets, there exists a function f from S to

X
s
such that f(s)∈X for every

Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 51Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
Here ϕ is f, S ≡O and X ≡ Γ. Our construction requires (AC) to show
that O is linearly ordered ([35], p. 4) and, more strongly, that O is well-
ordered set. In fact, given any triplet of distinct elements h
n−1

,h
n+1
, one
has h

. Moreover, every non-empty subset ofO has a smallest
element ([35], p. 5). Because of O = N∪{ω
0
} and it is zero-start and well-
ordered,O is an inﬁnite Dedekind set and enjoys these interesting properties:
a) ifη∈O is transﬁnite, Card(O)≡η. According to the previous discussion,
this property extends via transﬁnite induction, the concept of maximal
element from ﬁnite to transﬁnite ordinals. While max(O) = ω
0
in terms
of ordinals, Card(O) =ℵ
0
in terms of cardinals.
b) η +1 = η. This relation is consistent with the construction of O and of
Γ: the least transﬁnite ω
0
is either the maximal element for Γ and the
natural limit for Γ. Transﬁnite ordinals give rise to a mismatch between
the cardinality and the number of elements in Γ anyway, according to the
Burali-Forti Paradox. As shown in the next section, the paradox cannot
extend to the Γ-type sequence of ϕ
h
(n);
c) ℵ

and its cardinality isℵ

;
d) there exists a cardinal number t, so that ℵ

joiningb) to c).
Now let the Kuratowski-Zorn lemma ([35], p. 8):
Lemma 4.3.1 (Kuratowski-Zorn). If for each linearly ordered subset A of a set X
ordered by ≤ there exists an x
0
∈X such that x≤x
0
for every x∈A, then X
has a maximal element.
SinceO is well-orderedand, for.theabove lemma, there exists one maximal
element inO so that the relation ‘≤’ applies toO. The lemma can be restated
as follows, after dropping the strict inclusion with no loss of generality:
Corollary 4.3.2. If for each linearly ordered subset A ⊆ X, X has a maximal
element for A, then
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 52Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
• if A⊂ X, there exists an x
0
∈ X such that x < x
0
for every x∈ A⊂ X
and X is ordered by <.
• if A⊆ X, there exists an x
0
∈ X such that x≤ x
0
for every x∈ A⊆ X
and X is ordered by ≤.
Also this corollary applies toO.
31
As we link the Kuratowski-Zorn lemma
to properties b),c),d), we can show that the maximal element in O is a co-
untable transﬁnite ordinal,M
O
= max(O); in particular, according to Cantor’s
theory, M
O
is the least transﬁnite countable value, conventionally deﬁned as
ω
0
. According to the same properties, ω
0
is the maximal element of O. Since
N ⊂ O and (AC) applies to O, the pair (O,≤) deﬁnes a well-ordered set of
ordinals where the maximal element is not a ﬁnite but a transﬁnite ordinal.
The well-orderednessofO allowsto apply the transﬁnite inductionto sets with
cardinality Card(A) ≡ h
k
and to O, where Card(O) ≡ ℵ
0
. Therefore O is a
countable set with transﬁnite maximal element. Comparatively, the sequence Γ
shall be a countable transﬁnite sequence of approximating functions too, and
one obtains this remarkable equivalence:
Card(O)≡ Card(N)≡ℵ
0
≡ Card (Q). (4.3.3)
Again, the transﬁnite induction of the propertyT(h) :h≤M
A

extends from
subsetsA

4.4 Remarks on applications and the Burali-Forti paradox
In the last section, we introduced the transﬁnite sequences of ordinals h ∈ O
and their properties. Here we illustrate that their application to the topology
31
This version of the lemma could help to ﬁgure out the induction from ﬁnite to transﬁnite ordinals, since it
ﬁnds a topological analogy which splits into two cases, depending on whether the inclusion is strict or not.
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 53Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
induced by indexed and transﬁnitesequences of contractingmapsϕ
h
cannot be
affected by the Burali-Forti paradox.
The Burali-Forti paradox brings in the evidence of a contradiction in the
construction of the set of all ordinal numbers. The latter are either used to
describethesizeofasequenceandtoindicatethelocationofanelementwithin.
More rigorously, ordinal numbers represent equivalence classes of well-ordered
sets with order-isomorphism being the equivalence relationship itself. Since
the set Ω of all ordinals enjoys the properties of the ordinal number, Ω can
be assumed as the ordinal number itself. (This is also the case for the set of
ordinalsindexing our sequence of contractingmapsϕ
h
.) The successor element
Ω+1 is strictly greater than Ω. But Ω+1 is again an element of Ω, because
Ω includes all ordinals; stated in terms of von Neumann ordinals (see p. 50),
Burali-Forti came to the contradiction:
Ω< Ω+1≤ Ω. (4.4.1)
The paradox originates from a property which applies recursively from the
elements to the whole set itself. One such kind of recursion affects Γ-type
sequences too. For example, the set of all functions ϕ
h
is a new ϕ-function:
ϕ(ϕ(ϕ(...ϕ(n))))≡ ϕ
h>0
(n). The central question is to check if the paradox
may hold for ϕ
h
or not.
Let h∈ Ω be the index indicating univocally each function ϕ
h
of the well-
ordered sequence. Any element of Γ indicated by the pair (ϕ,h). The original
double inequality (4.4.1) turns into the double topological relation
ϕ
Ω
⊃ϕ
Ω+1
⊆ϕ
Ω
(4.4.2)
for Γ-typesequences. The limit(2.5.1)for Liouvillenumbers, togetherwiththe
regular sets model, satisﬁes the left-hand relationϕ
Ω
⊃ϕ
Ω+1
and the operator
‘⊆’ in the right-hand side ϕ
Ω+1
⊆ ϕ
Ω
. The limit prevents the paradox from
holding, because of the following ﬁxed point property for approximating func-
tions: in the topological terms of the regular sets model applied to that limit,
the Cremer pointsδ∈L are ﬁxed for the whole sequence of nested and shrink-
ing inclusionssetI
h+1
⊆I
h
(see deﬁnitionof fundamentalpointsat p. 35 here),
i.e. the intersection for all I
h
where h = 1,2,3,.... According to the Brouwer
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 54Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
theorem, there exists one ﬁxed point δ for
T
Ω
h=0
I
h
≡ {δ}. Because of δ is a
ﬁxed point with period 1 and accessed by Γ when h is transﬁnite (ϕ
Ω
(n)≡δ),
the formula (4.4.2) can be equivalently rewritten as follows:
ϕ
Ω
(n)⊃ϕ
Ω+1
(n)⊆ϕ
Ω
(n). (4.4.3)
Therefore
δ⊃ϕ[ϕ
Ω
(δ)]⊆δ.
Because of δ is a ﬁxed point, one has
δ⊃ϕ
1
(δ)⊆δ;
or the tautology
δ⊃δ⊆δ,
where no contradictions arise. In no strict inclusion terms, every set includes
all elements of the set itself. Therefore the one-element set includes itself and
it is either subset, superset and equivalent to itself (and it coincides with the
universal covering). Although h is ordinal and Γ inherits the properties of Ω,
the ﬁxed point property of ϕ
h
(n) naturally resolves the paradox.
32
This same
property does not hold for the set Ω of indexes: in fact, there is no ﬁxed value
for the relation (4.4.1).
One further application involves Number Theory, where ordinals h ∈ O
are applied to the transﬁnite sequence of real exponential mapsq
h
, withq≥ 2.
Accordingtop. 44,ontheapproximationofLiouvillenumbersandtherequired

functions in order to have a fuller control on these sequences. The followingre-

sense of such extensions

is not to drop but to keep up and sharpen the same
fundamental condition for all these sequences to work. One sees Λ-type or Δ-
type sequences as disguised versions of the Γ-type: the (ir-)rationalform of the
indexes can be equivalently deconstructed into subsequences of arbitrarily low
depth and through integer sub-indexes h.
Let I be the inclusion set (refer back to p. 40), where the index h ∈ N.

Now let a Γ-type sequence. For example, ash increases from 3 to 4, we ﬁnd the
topological inclusionϕ

(I). This generally holds from anyh
to h+1 or, reversely, fromh+1 to h.
Analogously let 3≤g≤ 4,g∈Q. For one such Λ-type sequence of contin-
uous ϕ-functions inside the difference set I

, it is easy to check that
the index valueg = 3,8 alludes to the intermediate subset I

:

Because of 3,8 = Int(3,8)+Frac(3,8), one may conventionally assume the ex-
istence of one main sequence and one subsequence: here the integer part (from
3 to 4) points to the main sequence, while decimals (0,8) to the nested subse-
quence of, say, depth -1. It is a recursive, top down generation process, where
the terms ‘main’ and ‘sub’ shall not be intended in absolute terms. Rather
they refer to a sub-dependency relation of arbitrary depth and between two se-
quences at consecutivedepths. Hence we cangeneratesubsequences recursively
over and over again, downwards to arbitrary depth and decimal n-th place of
the (ir-)rational index. For example, at a next stage, let g = 3,81. The index
g has two decimal places. According to the above topological inclusion,
I

⊂I

with two orders of sub-dependency: one main sequence and two subsequences.
Again, let g = 3,79, then we ﬁnd

One such higher degree of freedom for Γ-sequences ﬁts better and more intu-
itively (than the Γ-type) the topological properties of the regular sets model,
where convergence of inclusion sets was not supposed to be always uniform.

Refer back to ﬁg. 2.6.1 at p. 36, which is very close to the sense of ﬁg. 4.5.1. The magnitude of the integer
and decimal digits in g, from 0 to 9 at the digits n-th place in g, affects the convergence or divergence speed
rate.

Proposition 4.5.1. Every Λ-type sequence with rational indexes can be assumed as
the composition of Γ-type subsequences, each one with integer indexes.
Itiseasytoextendthisdiscussiontoirrationalindexes, whenthesequencemay
ﬁnally reach any real value. For (4.6.1), one can state:
Proposition 4.5.2. Let α ∈ R be a limit point. We can resume the types and
behaviors of sequences as follows:
1. the limit α can be reached via ﬁnitely many steps by a Γ-type sequence;
2. if α∈L⊂R\Q, the limit α can be reached via transﬁnitely many steps by
a Δ-type sequence;
3. if α∈D(κ)⊂R\Q,κ≥ 2, the limit α can be inﬁnitesimally approximated
by a Δ-type sequence.
We are going to show the possibility of matching the numerical natures of
the indexes with the real limits. The limits for sequences with with rational
indexes can be exclusively and sequences with irrational indexes follow the
above points 2 and 3.

A longer chain of decimals in the index equals to a slower approximating

Proposition 4.5.3. The increasing and decreasing nature of the magnitude of each

approximating functions.
The ﬁnal extension applies inductively to Δ-type sequences with real in-
dexes. The possibility for the index g to be irrational certainly raises the
question on how slow one subsequence is required to run. Recall that if a se-
quence ofany typeΓ,Λ or Δ, sayfor exampleΓ :{ϕ

limit, say λ, then the following two conditions are equivalent:

2. intermsofindexes, theconvergenceϕ

We remark that the indexes sequence is not the Γ-type or the Λ-type sequence;
while the former involves indexes exclusively, the latter deals with the values
returned by the approximating functions.
36
The reaching or even the approx-
imation of limit values by sequences follow an analogous discussion about the
approximation of indexes. The response may optionally rely on the theory
of Diophantine Approximations. Here one differs Diophantine from Liouville
irrationals.
In this direction, the limit index s∈R\Q and Diophantine, the behaviour
of Δ-type sequence is ruled by the same conditions, as stated in the theory of
DiophantineApproximations. In fact,f ≡

This consideration is not pointless, because indexes and functions may match. For example, in the case

approximating functions are applied to smaller and smaller domains.

Proposition 4.5.4. The possibility of reaching to θ ∈ L associates instead to the

slower than any time-constructable func-

39
Roughly speaking, reaching to θ ∈ L requires a transﬁnite number of
approximating functions to compensate the decreasing speed rate; otherwise,
ﬁnitely many such functions would not be enough.
An approximating function ϕ
f
(h) of Δ-type sequence, with f ∈ R, can
reach the limitθ∈L when f ∈R\Q. Hence its speed rate decreases inﬁnitesi-
mally to zero as the chain of decimals develops. One would like to distinguish
two cases: when the limit index g ∈ L and when s ∈ D(κ),κ ≥ 2, i.e. when
the speed rate can decrease to zero or just slow inﬁnitesimally to zero. In both
cases, we notice that the limit value is irrationaland accessible. The above dis-
cussion followedaccording to the theory of Diophantine approximations,which
collects the study of the best conditions for approximating irrationals via ra-
tional convergents p

among the goals. But, sinceQ is dense in R, one can
choose convergents which do not satisfy these rules and which are arbitrarily
close to the given irrationallimit. The conditionf ∈R shows up organicallyas
the extremal completion of the regular set construction, because it is natural
for Δ-type sequences to reach any real number, in conformity to the relation
(4.6.1), when rational or irrational limits are reached after ﬁnitely many or, if
required, transﬁnitely many steps respectively. We need now to restate propo-
37
One can add something more along these lines. Dynamically speaking, slower speed rates are both shown
during the convergenceofiterated points to a Cremer point as well as inside any petal of the Leau-Fatouﬂower,
while reaching to the ﬁxed saddle point. See section 5.1.
38
After sections 4.8 and 4.9, focusing on metrics, we will understand how the expression in absolute refers to
the (approximating) function speed.
39
In computational complexity theory, it is a function χ from naturals to naturals (thus we can ﬁnd a map
σ(n),n∈N so thatσ◦χ(n):N→Q) and enjoying the property thatχ(n),n∈N can be constructed fromn by
a deterministic Turing machine in the time of orderχ(n). For example, polynomials with positive non-integral
coeﬃcients are time-constructable, as well as exponentials in the formq

where q,n∈N.

sition 4.5.4 in terms of sequences:
Proposition 4.5.5. The possibility of reaching θ ∈L depends on the existence of
a sequence (either of Γ or of Δ-type) whose set of approximating functions (or
the set of indexes) has cardinalityℵ
0
, or equivalently where the maximal index
is ω
0
.
4.6 Again on non-integer indexes
The equipotency between N and Q motivates the assumption of the injection
τ : N → Q and of sequences with non-integer indexes h. This affects the
behavior of the Γ sequence. Regarding rational approximation of irrationals, a
special attention will also be paid to the limit case of h∈R\Q, after drawing
the following, opportune conclusions.
According to the previous propertiesb),c) andd) of transﬁnite numbers, a
ﬁrst result is as follows:
Proposition 4.6.1. The least transﬁnite ordinal ω
0
is the natural limit for the set
of ﬁnite ordinals h<ω
0
so that, given h→ω
0
:
• the Γ-type sequence reaches the limit θ when h is transﬁnite;
• the sequence ϕ
h
(n) ends with the transﬁnite index h =ω
0
;
• ϕ
ω
0
(n) is the limit case, i.e. it is the limit function at the end of the
sequence ϕ
h
(n).
From the transﬁnite induction, it turns out that the question about the limit, as
reconsidered in this new and wider transﬁnite environment, drops the assump-
tion that the fate of the Γ-type sequence of ϕ
h
(n) is to decrease inﬁnitesimally
as the index h grows, that is, always running but never reaching to its natural
stop, the limit value. Transﬁnite indexes push the Γ-type sequence ϕ
h
(n) to the
limit function ϕ
ω
0
(n).
Sinceθ∈L is accessible, we showed here that Γ can reachθ when Card(Γ)
is a transﬁnite value exclusively. The accessibility property ofθ and transﬁnite
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 62Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
sequence condition are intimately related. Otherwise, if transﬁnite sequences
arenotsuﬃcienttoreachthelowerboundintheLiouvilleinequality(2.5.1)and
θ is not be accessible, likeit happens for Diophantineirrationals: in fact, trans-
ﬁnite integers are maximal in absolute and there are no ordinals with greater
magnitude. Theaccessibilityproperty,ifenjoyedbutnotsatisﬁedthroughﬁnite
ordinals, it shall be through transﬁnite integers.
Countable transﬁnitely many approximating functions ϕ
h
(n) are required to
reach θ. These last remarks help us to anticipate what follows:
Proposition 4.6.2. Let Γ be a sequence, indexed by ordinals h ∈ O and which
reaches θ ∈L. There exists an equipotent sequence Λ, indexed by transﬁnitely
many indexes g and reaching to θ.
This wider opening to rational indexes will bring much more insight on the
nature and on the dynamics of Γ and of Λ, yet unclear when h was just an
integer. More beneﬁts will follow, like in the ﬁnal proof here. Let h∈Q. One
likestopushΛ-typesequencestotheextremelyeﬃcientperformance. Questions
naturally arise on the sense of a sequence with irrationalindexes, which results
from their approximation via rationals. The case of h ∈ R\Q may seem to
represent an exception for the dynamics of Γ-type or of Λ-type sequences of
approximating functions, unless we look at things as follows.
Recall that the original index was h ∈ N. Let Γ be a function space W,
generatedbythesequenceofallfunctionsϕ
h
(n). It iswellknowninSetTheory
and Functional Analysis that W is a sequence space, that is, the set of all
functions withn∈N. Since h∈N, then
ϕ :N→I ≡ [0,1]\D(∞). (4.6.1)
(In the next section, we will show the reason why we excluded the setD(2+).)
The equivalence between Γ and the regular sets model for Liouville numbers,
shown in section 3, allows to drop N and work with the larger set O instead,
O⊃N. If we assume that the image domain of ϕ extends to R, (4.6.1) forks
into these two cases:

4.7 Equivalences
The equivalence between the Diophantine Approximations of Liouville irra-
tionals and the regular sets model allows to review the latter in terms of se-
quences of indexes. Let G andH be two functions, so that

at p. 52, the value we found is enough for our further purposes, but we wonder
whether such estimation could be improved by showing that the cardinality
could be even larger thanℵ
0
or not.
41
We showed that moving fromQ toR is theoretically possible via sequences
of transﬁnitely many steps, provided that the functions
ϕ
h
(n)→ψ(n)⇔Q→R
are suﬃciently fast. L ⊂ R\Q ⊂ R is everywhere dense and includes un-
countably many points. This amounts to look for a function ψ from a set of

(say N or Q) to a set of cardinality ℵ

In general, the approximation function reshapes when the index turns from naturals to rationals, covering
ranges of values not usually retrieved if indexed by natural numbers.

quotient between two integers where at least one is transﬁnite. This exten-
sion is plausible in terms of formal algebraic systems of symbols, according to
Gleyzal [44] and to Artin and Schreier [2]. Gleyzal formulated the existence
of a parametrizable and ordered ﬁeld O, which represents the maximal gener-
alization of R. When such parameter is 0, Gleyzal showed that O turns into
R. Otherwise, O turn into distinct algebraic systems of prime numbers, or of
integers, rationals, of reals or of complex numbers of transﬁnite order ([44], p.
586). As the existence of transﬁnite fraction is formally acknowledged, we call
upon the theory of Grzegorczyk hierarchy [39] and in particular Ackermann
functions [20, 31, 55], in order to generate the transﬁnite fractions.
Ackermann functions are computable, but not primitively recursive; their
growth is much faster than single exponential functions a
x
and even than the
multiple versiona
a
...
a
x
. One deﬁnes the Ackermann function⊕ as follows:

n =m

wherem is exponentiated to the n

For example,
3⊕

10⊕

16
, m = 10,n= 3,k = 4.
It is evident that they are as incredibly fast as they can reach large num-
bers through relatively small values of the parameters. From the completely
parametric formulation of Ackermann functions, one realizes that their speed
rate is larger than standard polynomials and that the ﬁne tuning of m and k
can open the reach to cardinals with arbitrarily large magnitude. Since primes
are subset of integers, we can generate transﬁnite integers or transﬁnite primes
via Ackermann functions.

4.9 On the Inverse Ackermann functions
In this section we will focus on deductions we have already drawn. According
to Ackermann’s developments, it is also worthwhile to extend the Ackermann
functionsto negativeexponentsk, they are analogouslytermedas Inverse Ack-
ermann functions ⊖. Their formal deﬁnition requires only a slight twist of the
sense of (4.8.1):

n⇒ǫ·m

|k−1|
m6= 0,k> 0,n> 0. (4.9.1)
It is clear that
liminf ǫ·m⊖
k
n = 0. (4.9.2)
This condition satisﬁes the deﬁnition of zero Lebesgue measure sets, as we
compare it to corollary (3.1.2). Let m again be a transﬁnite value. There-
fore (4.9.1) turns into a transﬁnite fraction and the lower bound (4.9.2) ﬁnally
vanishes identically:
liminf
ǫ
m
n
|k−1|
= 0. (4.9.3)
Otherwise, the zero limit would not be accessible to such fractions.
With regards to the analogybetween the regular sets model and Liouville’s
limit (discussed in section 2.1), we would be remiss not to point out the impli-
cations of (4.9.3) viewed from these new perspective. In particular, (4.9.3) can
be revisitedin lightof (3.2.2), which leads to the Liouvillelimit. So the Inverse
Ackermann function plays the same role as of approximating function

In both cases, the denominators of (4.9.5) shall include at least one factor
behaving such as (4.9.4). From a wider viewpoint, the right-hand side fraction
in (4.9.1), can be listed into one among the ﬁve categories below for fractions
with transﬁnite elements:
1. m is transﬁnite and n,k are non-transﬁnite;
2. m,k are non-transﬁnite and n is transﬁnite;
3. m,n are non-transﬁnite and k is transﬁnite;
4. m,n are transﬁnite andk is non-transﬁnite;
5. m,n,k are transﬁnite.
Onecanalsostateanalternativedeﬁnitionofthetransﬁniteextensionin(4.9.1),
as one argues that the limit (4.9.3) is always satisﬁed by all these categories.
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 68Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
Our ﬁnal purposes dictate to pay a closer attention to transﬁnite fractions,
but in a more general ﬂavor, where the fraction is endowed with both Acker-
mann and Inverse Ackermann functions in the numerator and in the denom-
inator respectively. The main restriction in the previous form ǫ/q
n
was that
transﬁniteness can be called in the denominator exclusively, so that transﬁnite
sequences do always decrease to zero: this may help to understand the fate of
the sequence of approximants to Liouville numbers in metric terms, but not
the nature of the fractionp
n
/q
n
. Hence we will consider this fraction in lowest
terms:
p
n
|k−1|
q
n
|k−1|
. (4.10.1)
For sake of simplicity, we can melt exponents into one, n for example, and
assume that the sequence of numerators and of denominators grows together
with n. We ﬁnd this more comfortable version, with no loss of generality for
the further conclusions:
p
n
n
q
n
n
. (4.10.2)
Now we can resume the previous list into this shorter versionincluding rational
non-rational fractions:
a) p
n
is non-transﬁnite and q
n
is transﬁnite;
b) p
n
is transﬁnite and q
n
is non-transﬁnite;
c) p
n
andq
n
are non-transﬁnite;
d) p
n
andq
n
are transﬁnite;
Question 4.10.1. What is the range of values assumed by these four categories?
Again, which values can be accessed by sequences of fractions belonging to each
of these four categories?
Category a) gives rise to fractions tending to vanish identically, while cat-
egory b), being the inverse of a) shall necessarily tend to transﬁnite rationals.
Category c) gives rise to rational numbers, as known. Since p and q are co-
prime, thenp
n
andq
n
are coprimetoo: no integercan be generatedby (4.10.2).
Thereforecategoryd)givesrisetononeoftheabovecategories(: nointegers,no

rationals), thus to irrational numbers. When the question is explored in terms
of accessibility property, we refer to irrationals which are accessible to rational
fractions. By deﬁnition, these are Liouville numbers.
45
One straightforward
example of categoryd) is the well-known Liouville constant:
c =
ℵ
0
X
j=1

−j!
= 0.110001000000000000000001000...,

. (4.10.3)
where
46
p
n
=
n
X
j=1
10
(n!−j!)
, q
n
= 10
n!
.
The factorials appearing in both numeratorp
n
and denominatorq
n
attest that
they are of multi-exponential kind, as we can check for the simpler form of q
n
:
q
n
= 10
n!
= 10
2
3
...
n
.
Since n! grows faster than (n!−j!), then p
n
<q
n
and 0<c< 1. The relation
(4.10.3) brings back again to light the ‘Inverse Ackermann nature’ of category
a) for functions governingthe metricsbetween the sequence of rationalapprox-
imants p
n
/q
n
and the Liouville number. As we refer back to the deﬁnition of
Diophantine irrationals (3.2.1) at p. 46, it is straightforward that κ in (3.2.1)
plays the same role in the ordinary fractionǫ/q
κ
as the exponentn
|h−1|
does in
the transﬁnitefractionǫ/m
n
|h−1|
(both fractionsbelong to the unit interval)like
for (4.9.4), and release this new deﬁnition tying to corollary 6.3.2 at p. 81:
Deﬁnition 4.10.1. According to Liouville’s approximation formula, Liouville irra-
tionals are the only Diophantine irrationals of transﬁnite order. The converse
holds as well: the only Diophantine irrationals of transﬁnite order are Liouville.
45
Refer back to our remarks on the accessibility to irrationals via transﬁnite sequences in section 2.5 and ff.

One can add the following corollary:
Corollary 4.10.1. If e
2πiθ
−1 = 0 holds, then θ∈Q or θ∈L. In the latter case,
θ can be expressed in terms of a transﬁnite fraction exclusively.
In light of transﬁnite sequences, there exists no drastic separation between
Diophantine and Liouville irrationals: both can be viewed under the same co-
herentapproach,determinedbythespeed ofconvergentsandgrowthofdenom-
inatorsq
n
. As we will understand below, the effect of this numerical deﬁnition
is analogous to the gluing power of hedgehogs in summarizing all invariant
sets arising in indifferent dynamics. In theoretical terms, we refer back to the
possibility, given by the regular sets model, to obtain a dual viewpoint on the
question of Diophantine Approximations which we will address at the end of
section5.1. In practicalterms, one easilyunderstandsthat, after walkingalong
a different path, we claimed the impossibility of algorithmically computing Li-
ouville numbers and also of electronically drawing hedgehogs.
Last but not least we will give a response to the question mark in (4.9.4),
raising the possibility of moving from the left to the right side. It is not so
obvious that we can do so. First the deductions from the last two sections call
for revisiting the du-Bois Reymond’s theorem 3.1.1 at p. 41. This statement
holds when ϕ
h
(n) is of polynomial type, thus it is not the case for Ackermann
functions check in, being evidently exponential. The conditionkq
n
θk = 0 then
holds under the latter situation exclusively. Polynomial speed is much slower
than that of exponentials because of the degree of freedom in the input of the
parameter values (base and exponent) inside the Ackermann function formula:
the largely parametrizable nature together with the exponential form of such
functions allow the latter to run transﬁnitely faster than polynomials. The
lower bound cannot be zero. Moving from the left side to the right of (4.9.4)
is impossible whenϕ
h
(n) is a polynomial. Otherwise, when the approximation
function is multi-exponential, this extension (4.9.4) shall take place. One can
give the following complement to du-Bois Reymond’s theorem:
Proposition 4.10.1. Positive and monotonically increasing Ackermann functions
with transﬁnite input values are absolutely the fastest ones.
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 71Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
It is clear that, in these new circumstances, the corollary 3.1.2 holds no
more. The studies of exponential maps in the forma
a
...
a
,a∈R go long back in
time and they are collectednowadays under the deﬁnitions of inﬁnitely iterated
exponentials, chains or towers of exponentials, or of hyper-powers. See [26, 43,
45, 46, 56, 60, 66] among the very wide literature on this last topic.
5 Forward to applications
5.1 Forcing through the folds of Reals
Movingfromthepreviousdiscussion, wesettletheequivalencebetweenthereg-
ular sets model and the Liouville inequality. We will later apply it to questions
of different nature. The construction of the regular sets model with Liouville
numbers as fundamental points is artiﬁcial, not peculiar to such numbers. One
canfreelyapplyitwhenthelimitisDiophantineanddrawthesameconsequen-
ces like in section 2.7.
Givenθ∈R\Q and an inﬁnitesimalinclusion setI
h
,θ∈I
h
, we know thatθ
cannot be the only Liouville number inside I
h
. There exist uncountably many
Diophantine and Liouville irrationals, andθ cannot be regarded as the natural
limit of a regular set. The previous degree of freedom suggests to run towards
Liouville numbers from two distinct paths of approximation: one is external,
along rationals (handling p
n
and q
n
), the other is internal along Diophantine
irrationals (through growing sequences of orderκ).

the results for continued fractions as well as on Set Theory. More promising
deductionswillbedrawnlater,afterfocusingonthetopologicalaﬃnitybetween
hedgehogs and Leau-Fatou ﬂowers, namely the empty linearization domains
that occur with non-linearizable hedgehogs and the rationally indifferent ﬁxed
point δ. Both belong to the Julia set J
θ
. The deﬁnition of the Leau-Fatou
ﬂower is among the basics in Holomorphic Dynamics and can be found inside
the textbooks [25, 64].
5.2 Cremer values and algorithms
According to du-Bois Reymond’s theorem 3.1.1 (see p. 41), a portion of state-
ment of 4.1.2 can be restated as follows:
Proposition 5.2.1. L is fundamental for the regular sets model and it cannot be
attained via one approximation process of countably many steps
What is the connection to hedgehogs?
Figure 5.2.1: The 7-petal Leau-Fatou ﬂower for the quadratic type germ with rational value θ =
3/7= 0,428571.
The fundamental points of a zero measure set enjoy the same topological
distribution as of values θ in the germ (1.1.5). It is clear that the shrinking
process of E
h
relates to the growth of h and one can associate each rational
approximant to the width of each E
h
. The degree of freedom for this process
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 73Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
allows to apply the model to Diophantine numbers, where the lower bound of
the widths ties to the maximal order κ. We can thus assert:
a) thatnumerically theexistenceofDiophantineirrationalsofarbitrarilyhigh

c) that the growth rate of the convergents p

according to the dynamics of the quadratic type germ
(1.1.5), which relate to the wedging action of the unbounded Fatou com-
ponent (whose attracting point is at∞) into the bounded basin;
d) that irrationalsθ are not computable via ﬁnitely many steps.
According to the algorithm deﬁnition,
49
the entry d), as well as 5.2.1, can be
revised for non-linearizable hedgehogs:
Proposition 5.2.2. Reaching Liouville numbers via a sequenced process is not al-
gorithmically feasible. Non-linearizable hedgehogs with Cremer points are not
computable.
6 Results in Holomorphic Dynamics
Computing the Hausdorff dimension of non-linearizable hedgehogs involves a
strategy of several stages, where in essence we convert the results already ob-
tained for the regular sets model into equivalent statements for Holomorphic
Dynamics. A summary appears in the table below, mirroring the concepts in
table 2.8 at p. 39.
48
Related speed rates are expressed in logarithmic terms, See [73], p. 249. S is maximal for θ of constant
type (κ = 2, see [64], p. 119), whereas, we ﬁnd hedgehogs with Siegel compacta for κ > 2, with a suﬃciently
small neighborhood ofθ, isomorphic to a rotational disc centered atδ.

going to prove that the case ofH

Secondly, one short passage in the celebrated work [36] (bottom of p. 247),
where Fatou introduced a rough approach by incrementing the petals ad inﬁni-
tum, i.e. via q
n

believed to have brought more evidences to his (erroneous) opinion that the
functionalequation(1.1.6)failsinsideanysmallneighborhoodofδ. Thepassage
also attests that Fatou pioneered the attack via rational approximants.
50
The
lack of the theoretical background attests that Fatou’s heuristic approach was
sketchedbutnotdeepened. Despitetheresults,Fatou’sstrategyrepresentedan
important advancement and his mistakes, although improperly, invite to check
if such method could represent an opening to further developments.

well as the petal angle ω

so that ω

irrationalscannot be reached by rationalapproximants. But Liouville numbers
can. Proposition3.1.1 in section 3.1 grantsthe accessibilityfor sequences of ra-
tionalapproximants{p

}toLiouvillenumbers. Atthispoint,wesummarize
all the previous results into this list of conditions: namely ...
1. ... that the destination exists (Liouville’s inequality and the metrics for
the setL of Liouville numbers);
2. ... that the destination is accessible and how to get to it (transﬁnite in-
duction and sequences of rational approximants);

4. ... the required speed to get to destination (faster than polynomials; in

belong to O (refer back to section
4.3). These fractions can represent Liouville numbers, according to category 5
of the list at p. 68. It is easy to ﬁnd close analogies with (3.1.7) at p. 44 and
to show that we can set

one such process affects ordinal numbers (the indexes). After it has been ex-
ported to iterates, the topology of the Leau-Fatou ﬂower around δ too. Thus
we need to understand how one could apply the transﬁnite induction while
‘travelling from ﬂowers to non-linearizable hedgehogs’. The accomplishing of
this goal requires the introduction of one topological propertyT, which holds
for the iterates f

≡ θ ∈ L. The property T is: ‘the existence of a Julia set curve, locally
pathwise connected and intersecting the ﬁxed pointδ at the origin’. The further
construction shows that the boundary topology of ﬂowers (when θ ∈ Q) and
of non-linearizable hedgehogs (when θ ∈ L) look like similar: in both cases,
the Julia set is a continuous curve intersecting the indifferent ﬁxed point δ.
Now it is useful to assume the existence of one transﬁnite sequence of fractions

Question 6.3.1. Why did we set up this particular sequence?
Answer: Recallthereaderthattheconstructionoftransﬁnitesequencesap-
proximating the Liouville irrationals through rational numbers was illustrated
in section 4.3. We pointed out to the double inequality (3.1.7), whose formula-

if we assume thatn starts from 0 (given a transﬁnite set,
we can assume the converse according to conditions b) and d) at p. 52). For
zero-start sets (see p. 51), the double role of ordinals allows to assume that
the cardinalityℵ

ofO is equal to the magnitude of the maximal index of the
sequence. It is suﬃcient to push

the exponent 2

Lemma 6.3.1. If λ from (1.1.5) is a primitive q-th root of unity, the numbern of
attracting directions at the ﬁxed point δ is a multiple of q. In other words, the
multiplicity n+1 of δ must be congruent to 1 modulo q.

After transﬁnitely many steps, assume we ﬁnally get
to the fraction at the right-hand side of (6.3.2). Thanks to Cantor, we know
the power-sets formula 2

and in general that q

for q ≥ 2. We
inductivelydrawthis(stillraw)conclusion: given (1.1.5)andθ∈L, there exists
an invariant set such as Leau-Fatou ﬂower with uncountably many directions
emanating radially everywhere from the ﬁxed point δ. The approximation of

discussing the topology of the Julia set when θ ∈ L in (1.1.5). We can state
the following corollary which extends the lemma 6.3.1 to transﬁnite fractions:

Accordingto(3.1.7)atp. 44,theapplicationofmulti-exponentialoperators(orinverseAckermannfunctions
for transﬁnitely many convergent functions to approximate the Liouville number) can help to get one such
denominator with transﬁnite exponent. Refer to the discussion after Khintchine’s theorem 2.2.1.
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 80Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
Corollary 6.3.2. Given θ∈L⊂ [0,1], the following conditions are equivalent:
1. θ is exclusively representable by a transﬁnite fraction p/q, where p,q are
transﬁnite;
2. according to the construction in lemma 6.3.1, the set of attracting and
repellingdirectionsfor a Leau-Fatouﬂower, continuouslyimpressesacircle

3. the petal angle ω vanishes identically.
While rational approximantsa

denominators q

grow together with the number of alternating (repelling and
attracting) directions in the Leau-Fatou ﬂowers. See the simulation along the

simplicity. This lemma also implies that, as the denominatorsq

nitude, the petals’ width inﬁnitesimallyshrink and the attracting(or repelling)
directionsprogressivelyinﬂate a disk-shaped neighborhoodof the ﬁxed pointδ,
i.e. they spread radially everywhere. By making use of the hypotheses in the
beginning of section 6.2, we can state:
Proposition 6.3.1. Let f

singularities of f

ﬂower enjoys the following properties:

b) the petal height h

c) the argument λ ∈ Q,λ = p/q ∈ [0,1) in e

, where p and q are ﬁnite
ordinals.
One understands thata) is straightforward because of the condition about
the petal angle ω > 0 assures that A

h

possible to reachθ∈L after ﬁnitely many steps and or not suﬃciently fast.

that they ‘impress’ the circle C (see ﬁg. 6.6.2/A). We are led to consider the

6.4 3rd part: Hunting with Liouville and Cantor
This construction relies on the full and continuous inﬂation of the circleC and
enjoys a precise correspondence to the classical Cantor’s diagonalization argu-
ment on the impossibility of a one-to-one map between the natural numbers
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 83Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
and a continuous line; indeed, one can use the diagonalization process to draw
almost identical consequences here. Since C is a continuum, we need uncount-
ably many intersection points u to cover it. The cardinalities of both U
A
and
U
R
need to be ‘upgraded’ to 2
ℵ
0
, for U to cover completely C; the cardinality
of the union set U will be 2
ℵ
0
too. This was possible by merging the extension
of theorem 2.5.4 to transﬁnite sequences of rational approximants with lemma
6.3.1. This translates the conclusions from such theorem into the geometries of
complex iterated maps. The terms of Cantor’s diagonalization and the chance
of its accomplishment shall be revisited in light of transﬁnite sequences or of
the speed rate of the one-to-one map.
6.5 Heuristics
We complete this discussion by looking at the question from the opposite view-
point of non-transﬁnite sequences, because our construction develops some re-
strictions. It is helpful to recall this basic theorem from Set Theory:
Theorem6.5.1. The setQ of rational numbers, consistingof positive and negative
fractions, can be put into one-to-one correspondence withN
+
.
This theorem leads to the unfortunate empirical implication that, starting
from Q, one cannot reach θ ∈ L and have uncountably many attracting and
repelling directions which cover continuously the circle C around δ. It looks
like impossible to generate transﬁnite fractions from fractions whose terms are
ﬁnite ordinals. Fractions with ﬁnite ordinals as terms generate ﬁnitely many
attracting and repelling directions impressing on C discretely: |u
1
−u
2
| > 0
holds for any given pair of intersectionpointsu
n
,u
n+1
onC. The cardinalityof
Q isℵ
0
<ℵ
1
. The ‘jump’ from ﬁnite to transﬁniteordinalsis purely theoretical.
Non-linearizable hedgehogs are deﬁnitely out of reach in computational terms.
The next results shall be interpreted under this remark.
6.6 4th Part: The basin annihilation
We move to the geometry of iterates near a Cremer pointδ and we discuss the
topology of the related invariant set.
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 84Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
Question 6.6.1. Could a Leau-Fatou ﬂower with uncountably many petals exist?
Does it make sense?
Given θ ∈R, the run from Q to L stops when ω
P
= 0: it is the extremal
stage of our construction. It is a unique and new situation, where the ﬂower
topology around δ is not kept up but annihilated. One such mismatch may
come up as the transﬁnite induction applies to the numerical terms of rational
approximants p
n
/q
n
and to the geometrical terms of Leau-Fatou ﬂowers with
increasing petals number. One could expect, like for numbers, that any prop-
erty, holding in all successor cases (with ﬁnite ordinals), would also hold in the
limit transﬁnite case. This new situation alerts to take care of the topological
implications, as well as to focus on the Julia set instead of the basin compo-
nent in the Leau-Fatou ﬂower, during the transition from ﬁnite to transﬁnite
ordinals, in order to cross-check all statements and to prevent mistakes and
contradictions. We study the shrinking width of petals and the consequences
in topologicalterms. From the contractionprocess one expects that each single
petal ﬁnally turns into a uni-dimensional curve. The construction itself can be
compared to a race splitting into two stages, the run and the arrival:
1. the run consists of a countable union of attracting and of repelling di-
rections while θ ∈L is approximated through rational convergents p
n
/q
n
;
petals still have positive area.
2. the arrival is the uncountable union set of such directions when θ ∈L is
reached by rational convergentsp
n
/q
n
of transﬁnite kind. Inductively, the
petal angleω vanishes identically.
Question 6.6.2. Could petals have zero area and be uni-dimensional curves?
For sake of simplicity, we will consider petals as open subsets of the basinB
0
of
attraction (to the ﬁxed pointδ = 0) exclusively here. The consequences on the
related Julia set will be drawn at last. We show that petals do not degenerate
into curves when the angle ω = 0 or when the repelling and attracting petals
(according to the classic Leau-Fatou ﬂower construction) disappear. It is not
so premature then to infer that Fatou components cannot be uni-dimensional
by invoking one fundamental theorem in classic holomorphic dynamics, in the
same original version as stated by Fatou and by Julia for meromorphic maps:

.
Given a two-dimensional set (either C or C
∞
) and according to the topo-
logical deﬁnition of Fatou set (F ≡C
∞
\J), one understands thatF shall have
positive area or be empty. Hence:
Proposition 6.6.1.F cannot consist of isolated points.
Nonetheless these are still weak assumptions. Stronger evidences will be
brought in. First, ad absurdum, let each petal be a curve by now.
Let θ ∈ L. According to our deductions from the application of Leau-
Fatou ﬂower theorem to transﬁnite fractions, there exists uncountably many
attracting/repellingdirectionsaroundtheCremerpointδ. Bythecombinatorial
viewpoint, it is easy to check that there are only four distributions for the two
sets U

k
andU
R
k
in the construction (6.3.3):
A) U

and U

are sets of attracting and of repelling directions, distri-
butions are permutable: so cases 2 and 3 are the same. The case 4 assumes
that both sets are empty, locally around the ﬁxed point. Since attracting and
repelling directions point out to the neighboring regions of the basins of attrac-
tion to δ and to∞ respectively, that previous table offers the resume of the 4

distribution cases for the basinsB
0
andB
∞
aroundδ. We will check which one
holds or not. With no loss of generality, these four distributionsradiallyspread
inside regular sectors with amplitude ω,0 ≤ ω
i
≤ 2π, as it customarily holds
for Leau-Fatou ﬂowers. We will dismiss all cases but D) because of A), B) and
C) lead to contradictions (refer to ﬁgs. 6.6.2):
A) the full distribution of R
0
over 2π. There is one only sector with two
angles ω
0
= 2π and ω
∞
= 0. The basin B
0
surrounds the Cremer point
δ, which by deﬁnition belongs to J
θ
. Thus δ is isolated. Contradiction:
Julia sets for polynomials (1.1.5), have no isolated points and are not of
(multi-)exponential kind ([64], p. 47).
B) full distribution ofR
∞
over 2π. Again, one only sector where amplitudes
areω
∞
= 2π andω
0
= 0. HereB
∞
surrounds the Cremer point. Thusδ is
isolated and the contradiction holds in the same terms as at A).
C) sectorial (or interlacing) distribution ofR
0
andofR
∞
over2π. Becauseof
entry 2 at p. 85 holds forθ∈L, one assumes the existence of more unions
of uncountably manyuni-dimensional petals. Aroundδ, the basinsB
0
and
B
∞
form 2n alternating sectors, with strictly positive angles ω

See ﬁg. 6.6.1. We want to discuss on the number of such sectors. This
situation splits into 2 sub-cases with interlacing distributions:
C.a) if alternating and repelling sectors are uncountably many, A) and B)
hold simultaneously, as if alternating directions superimpose on re-
pellingones. Besidestheoddimplicationthatbothbasinswouldﬁll-in
the same neighborhood aroundδ, we would draw again the contradic-
tion: the Cremer point δ is isolated.
C.b) if alternating and repelling sectors are countably many, the same dis-
tribution like for Leau-Fatou ﬂowers, when θ∈Q, holds. But (3.2.1)
holds by hypothesis here; equivalently, if ω > 0 we ﬁnd countably

Figure 6.6.2: Contradictions arise. These drawings show the three hypothetical distributions of

We know that the point at inﬁnity is super-attracting and ﬁxed for (1.1.5): the

We term the situation in D) as the basin annihilation. Therefore this local

The proposition 6.6.2, although labelled as ‘pathological’ in respect of the
usual Julia set topologies for the iterates of rational maps, does not give rise
to contradictions. The annihilation of the bounded basin B
0
follows the ac-
complishment of the transﬁnite induction (discussed in section 6.3), where the
property T, namely the existence of a Julia set curve intersecting the ﬁnite
ﬁxed point, alwaysholds whilethe argumentθ runs fromQ toL. The bounded
basin of attractioncannot grant one such property, because it disappears when
θ ∈ L. For the family of polynomials f
α
, when α ∈ Q or α ∈ L, the Julia

set always intersects δ = 0. One minor conclusion from the previous proof is
that the existence of the Leau-Fatou ﬂower, assumed as a neighborhood U of
δ, where δ ∈ U, U ∩B
0
6≡ ∅ and f
n

→ δ, may not be meant as the dominant
property for the transﬁnite induction to work. One understands the existence
of a (bounded) region H about δ, whose multiplier is e

that B

θ
=e

) andθ∈ [0,1] be Liouville. There exists a
bounded, non-empty neighborhood of δ which intersects no Fatou components.
This can be equivalently stated in terms of Julia sets:
Theorem 6.6.4. Let f

) and θ ∈ [0,1] be Liouville. Let J

the related Julia set. There exists a bounded, non-empty area H ⊃ δ so that

6.7 The inﬁnite broom and local connectivity
The previous construction splits into the non-limit and the limit stage, where
there are countably and uncountably many attracting/repelling directions re-
spectively. The investigationofthe topologicalpropertiescanbe madethrough
the revisitation into a parameterized version resulting from the modiﬁcations
applied to the inﬁnite broom space B, shown in ﬁg. 6.7.1/a. We introduce this
metric
56
deﬁnition of local connectivity ([64], p. 169):
Deﬁnition 6.7.1 (Local connectivity). Let X ⊂C
∞
be a compact metric space. X is
locally connected if, for every ǫ > 0, there exists δ > 0 so that any two points
of X of distance <δ are contained in a connected subset of X of diameter≤ǫ.
56
There exist more equivalent versions, but not involving metrics. We like this one because of matching our
metric environmentrelated to the basin annihilation. Observethat this deﬁnition is recursive: at the successive
stage, the role of X can be played by the ‘connected subset of X’ and so on. Thus ǫ and δ can be arbitrarily
decreased. Moreover, if the operator ‘<δ’ is replaced with ‘≤δ’, this deﬁnition switches the local connectivity
from the open to the closed type (which does not affect the possibility forX to be open or closed). We are not
interested anyway in this further distinction, keeping up the above version.

The broom spaces are generated by a sequential construction where suc-
cessive subset combs C
n
inﬁnitesimally squeeze. B is not locally connected
because of the positive distance between any pair of C
n
. This lets the above
connectivitytestfailat anypairofpointsbelongingtotwodistinctcombs. Our
modiﬁcations strengthens the reasons for this failure by ﬁrst (6.7.1/b) letting

= A. The sequence
C

tends to shrink up to a limit line, thus following the same fate as petals
do in our construction. Equivalently, ﬂowers (intended the union of disjoint
petals) are compact, connected but not locally connected, according to deﬁni-
tion 6.7.1: for example, consider two points of two distinct petals respectively.
These conclusions extend to their boundaries: either∂B andJ
θ
are not locally
connected for all non-limit stages of the construction. Anywayone notices that
both curves are locally pathwise connected.

at the non-linearizable case. It is straightforward that J
θ
is also
locallypathwiseconnected. But,inaddition,J
θ
isacontinuumnowandspreads
radially everywhere: thereforeJ

. This consequence ﬁnds one analogy to
the following theorem, stated by P´ erez-Marco in 1994 ([72], p. 4):
Theorem 6.7.1. If a rational function has a Cremer point, its Julia set contains
a dense set of non-accessible points.
The persistence of the Julia set curve (along our whole construction and
alwaysenjoyingthe localpathwiseconnectivityproperty)showsthat thetrans-
ﬁnite induction shall apply to J

6.8 5th Part: Locally connected non-linearizable Hedgehogs
We explain what happens to non-linearizablehedgehogs in local terms, that is,
insideasuﬃcientlysmallandboundedneighborhoodHoftheﬁxedpointδ = 0,
where the previous construction took place. This motivates our conclusions
through complementary and known results about Diophantine irrationals. If
θ∈L, the previous construction leads us to assume that
B

∩H =∅ and B
∞
∩H =∅.
It is straightforwardthat consequences shall be drawn in terms of the local
action induced by our construction, which just works locally, hence the results
shall be also locally evaluated. We already showed that the petal height is
necessarilybounded inproposition6.3.1: so hedgehogscannotextendup to the

and non-linearizable Julia set spreading radially everywhere around
the Cremer point δ. For sake of clarity, we liked to follow the terminology in
the recent preprint [9], where such J
θ
is classiﬁed as of solar type:
59
in light
of these results, as recently stated into the theorem 1.1 at [9], p. 3, the local
connectivity property can be re-framed as follows:
Proposition 6.8.1. J
θ
is connected im-kleinen.
Whenθ∈L,itisliketherewouldbetransﬁnitelymanyattracting/repelling
directions, or equivalently the Julia set J
θ
emanates from δ so that, in a suf-
ﬁciently small disk C centered at δ, one has J
θ
∩C ≡ C. By a proper home-
omorphism, there exists a full Lebesgue measure set of angles over S
1
, where
degenerate impressions(i.e.,consistingofonepoint)aregiven. Resuming,given
θ ∈ L, the Julia set for (1.1.5) is (1
◦
) a locally connected curve, (2
◦
) spreads
radially everywhere about the origin, (3
◦
) ﬁlls in a bounded and connected re-
gion (theorem 6.6.4). If θ ∈ L, J
θ
is a plane-ﬁlling curve inside a bounded
neighborhood ofδ and we can state:
Theorem 6.8.1. Given θ∈L, the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set J
θ
is 2.
Ontheotherhand, ifθ6∈Lbutθ∈D(2+), onerefersbacktoacomplementary
result by McMullen ([63], p. 1):
Theorem 6.8.2 (McMullen). The Hausdorff dimension for Julia sets of polynomials
f
θ
, where θ is Diophantine, is strictly less than 2.
Let f
θ
: e
2πiθ
z +O(z

), where θ ∈ L ⊂ [0,1]. We summarize all the
topologicalsituation around the Cremer point into these equivalent conditions:
1. The Julia set J
θ
of f
θ
has Hausdorff dimension 2, andδ∈J
θ
;
58
This property allows to apply the so-called Carath´ eodory’s extension theorem ([64], p. 169): a conformal
isomorphism ψ :D

∞
extends to a continuous map from the closed disk D onto U if and only if the
boundary ∂U is locally connected, or if and only if the complement C

U ≡∂U ≡H≡J
θ
. See also [73], pp. 246 and ff., where the correspondence between the two models was shown
in order to earn one more degree of freedom and study iterates via analytic circle diffeomorphism.

This work lists a second conﬁguration, termed red dwarf and featuring no local connectivity aroundδ. The

The non-linearizable hedgehog is one such Julia set J
θ
. This corollary follows:
Corollary 6.8.3. Let θ ∈ L ⊂ [0,1]. The dynamical system generated by the
iterates of f(z) : e
2πiθ
z +O(z
2
) consists of the basin B
∞
of attraction to ∞
and of the Julia set J
θ
, whose Hausdorff dimension is 2 and ﬁlls in a bounded,
connected, two-dimensional neighborhood around the Cremer point δ = 0.
It would be interesting to study how the Hausdorff dimension increases
together with the orderκ of the Diophantine valueθ and how this affects both
the topology and geometry of hedgehogs. Along this direction, we mention the
following theorem by Heinemann and Stratmann ([47], p. 572):
Theorem 6.8.4. Let f
t
: C → C be given by z 7→ e
2πiθ
z +z
2
. There exists a
sequence{θ
n
} such that, where dim
H
(J(f

n
)) denotes the Hausdorff dimension
of the Julia set J(f
θ
n
), the following formula holds:
limsup
n→∞
dim
H
(J(f
θ
n
)) = 2.
In our notation, since the Julia set J
θ
of theorem 6.8.1 covers a non-empty
planar region H and spreads radially around δ with no provileged directions,
one argues that J
θ
shall include non-accessible points fromC\H.
7 Remarks and speculations
7.1 Flowers and singularities distribution
In conclusion, our hypotheses and results about non-linearizablehedgehogs de-
pend on the polynomial nature of P
θ
: e
2πiθ
z +O(z
k
),k ≥ 2 and to θ ∈ L.
Therefore we cannot miss to remark the following restrictions.
First, our construction depends on the geometry of the Leau-Fatou ﬂower:
as the sequence {p
n
/q
n
} approximates θ ∈ L, the shape of J
θ
is deduced by
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 94Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
that of the ﬂower, while the number of petals grows. Given a rational angle,
this ﬂower has no privileged direction(s) to spread its petals. Via transﬁnite
induction, this same property is inherited by J
θ
. We found out the so-called
solar hedgehog J
θ
, i.e. a Julia set curve with (1
◦
) Hausdorff dimension 2, (2
◦
)
ﬁlling in a non-empty region, (3
◦
) including the irrationally indifferent ﬁxed
point δ, (4
◦
) spreading radially everywhere around it. In second instance, we
assumeda verysimplesingularitiesdistributionforP
θ
: lackingofpolesat ﬁnite
distance and of essential points, a relatively easy local environment was to be
investigated about the origin. Here nothing affects the radially everywhere
distribution of J
θ
because, as one guesses, the distance from the origin to the
closest singularity of P
θ
at ∞ would be shorter than the maximal modulus of
any point z ∈ J
θ
(i.e.: the singularity seems to be too far to not affect the
radially everywhere extension ofJ
θ
). Hence the ‘solar’ term follows.
At this stage, we might want to get rid of these restrictions, looking at the
wider realm of complex rational functionsR(z). The investigation on the iter-
ates ofR(z) was also the starting point for Fatou and Julia, back in late 1910s.
Regarding the questions about local behavior, these two French mathemati-
cians, and later Cremer, Siegel, Cherry et Alia, were concerned of determining
the possibility of the linearization R
n
(z) 7→ e
2πiαn
,α ∈ R\Q in a suﬃciently
small neighborhood of the indifferent ﬁxed pointδ. After the outstanding con-
tributions by Cremer and Siegel begun to settle the question deﬁnitely, it was
natural to deepen several aspects by focusing on the iterations of polynomi-
als P
α
, working out the linearization when α is algebraic of ﬁnite order κ. It
turned out that this trend shifted the original question from rational maps to
polynomialsP
α
or in the formz
2
+c wherec∈C, producing a wide literature.
Although the knowledge of hedgehogs topology for a general polynomial is
still far from the full accomplishment, the question on linearization has been
completelysettledforthequadratictypeofP
α
. Besideshigherorders,onewould
also like to pay the attention again to rational maps,
60
where the investigation
of hedgehogs might open to newer perspectives, as we try to illustrate further.
Given an hedgehogH, its geometry (as well as topology) could be shaped,
60
Indifferent dynamics for rational maps have been mostly investigated in terms of Blaschke’s products,
introduced in the next section. Refer to [48, 49, 69, 74, 88]. See also [75, 80, 81] for general rational maps.

as we conjecture, by the singularities distribution around H; for example, by
singularities at ﬁnite distance and of different order. No doubt that another
remarkablequestionisabouttheaccessibilitytoH. Inthisdirection,thereader
canﬁndsomerelatedresultsscatteredinanumberofworks[8,9,54,85,91,97].
Because every polynomial is a rational map, this latter family shows up as
the best place to ground the general theory on hedgehogs:
Question 7.1.1. Given a complex rational map R(z) ≡
p(z)
q(z)
with Cremer point
δ, how can the distribution of singularities of R(z) affect the shape and the
extension of the non-linearizable hedgehogH ?

Besidesthe solartype, whichwe showedtoappearforiterates ofpolynomialP

pointδ is the white disc, located in the interior(thus inaccessible fromB

one or more accessibility directions respectively). The number of components in (c) is guessed to be
n≥2 in general.
It seems likely that an answer to this question can be presumably given
by looking at the algebraic or transcendental polynomial nature of p(z) and of
q(z). In this direction, as even shown in [9], hedgehogs are not only of solar
type, thus the Leau-Fatou ﬂower cannot be the only model to shape H for a
rational map with Cremer points. One might want to deepen the conditions
determining what are the shapes ofH. One hypotheticalscenario was sketched

dimension of non-linearizable hedgehogs is lesser than 2, or if the complement
C\H includes more than one basin of attraction. One notices that B

holds in all the three suggested conﬁgurations; the Julia set curve has still
Hausdorff dimension 2 and ﬁlls in the dashed regions. With regard to ﬁgs.
7.1, we wonder whether (b) or (c) might hold and at what conditions: if just

of neighboring singularities which are suﬃciently close to J

. It would be
also interesting to determine theorems ruling these possibilities and, if so, to
give examples of rational maps related to such two cases. Since the Julia set
structure is homogeneous, the situations where non-linearizable hedgehogs can
be met seem to restrict to rational maps with two basins of attraction.
7.2 On the doubly connected case
The construction we illustrated in section 6.1 intimately relates to the poly-
nomial (1.1.5) and to the Leau-Fatou ﬂower, when |e
2πiθ
| = 1 and θ ∈ Q.
By looking at hedgehogs as degenerate Siegel compacta, one understands that
the previous proof is peculiar to the simple connectivity of such compacta.
This represent a restriction because it cannot be exported to doubly connected
hedgehogs, when the rotation domain, termed a ‘Herman ring’, is isomorphic
to an annulus ([73], p. 281). One also knows that Herman rings cannot arise
for polynomials according to Sullivan’s classiﬁcation (theorem 9.2, [7], p. 122),
but they can for Blaschke products

151), like in the simple connected case of Siegel discs [88]. One wonders if a
modiﬁcationofourpreviousconstructionmayhelp. Ifso,itwouldbeinteresting
to check ﬁrst the local invariant set for (7.2.1), when θ ∈ Q and then let the
construction run, with proper adaptations. Given θ∈L, one expects a plane-
ﬁlling curve inside a doubly connected neighborhood here.

7.3 On computer simulations
Computer simulations, in the two cases where the Siegel compactum does not
degenerateintotheCremerpoint,areveryclosetotheiractualshape. Although
computerscanhandlerationalnumbers,wedonotseeLeau-Fatouﬂowerswhen
we input a suﬃciently sharp rational approximationof an irrational numberμ,
but quasi-rotational dynamics, i.e. fairly close to what the full Siegel com-
pactum related to μ would look like if the endless chain of decimals could
actually be input.
‘Irrationality’ does not only involve the existence of the endless chain of
decimals, but also the non-periodicity of the sequence. In addition, we do not
feel the separation between rationalsand irrationalsas drastic as the fractional
representationmight suggest. The existence of such a continuitycan be further
strengthened by noticing the almost-reproducibility of some computer simu-
lations mentioned at the top, which depict hedgehogs with non-empty Siegel
compacta. The classic computer experiments on Siegel disks showed that we
deal with numbers which are not properly rationals, in the sense that, as we
input them into the valueθ ofe
2πiθ
z+O(z
2
), we do not see Leau-Fatou ﬂowers;
onthecontrary,theycannotbeassumedasproperlyirrationals,becauseofdec-
imalstruncation. We knowthattheformervalues, sayξ, areapproximationsof
irrationals;theterm ‘approximation’is just a numericalconventionaboutξ be-
ing arbitrarilyclose to another valueθ, anyway this term does not retrieve any
information on the dynamical properties we are interested in here. Therefore,
from the dynamical viewpoint, one may speak of ‘almost-irrational’ numbers,
mid-way between rational and irrationals: again, rationals showing dynamical
properties very close to those for irrationals. A ﬁrst clue can be watched into
the decimals chain. Being periodic for rationalsand aperiodic for irrationals,is
it then possible to classify all reals by a parameter which serves as a disorder
indicator, telling how irregular the decimals chain is?
If so, we guess that one such indicator should take on the lowest value for
rationals whose period starts with the ﬁrst decimal place (no disorder), then
grows with the place of the period, ﬁnally becoming maximal for irrationals.
One might try to check whether there are irrationals whose decimal chain is
‘wilder’ than others. One such disorder parameter could even help to realize

what we termed as the ‘ideal journey’ through the indifferent dynamics
61
and
sketched out in the previous proof. Although irrational values are beyond the
scope of algorithms,one can classify their resistanceto rationalapproximation,
according to the known limit (3.2.1), which states that Diophantine irrationals
may stop access to rational approximants, while Liouville numbers do not, at
least theoretically through a suitable sequence.
7.4 On the computational complexity of Julia sets
According to proposition 5.2.2 (p. 74) and to the previous discussion, one can
easily argue that it makes no sense to look for features of dynamical systems
when θ is Liouville via rational approximants. As approximation is the art of
getting arbitrarily close to a given value, we do not want to approximate Li-
ouville numbers because we ﬁnd rationals (from both theoretical and empirical
viewpoint) being “arbitrarily close” to Diophantine numbers of large order κ.
Thus they cannot help to retrieve the expected properties (either in dynami-
cal or numerical terms) of Liouville numbers. Approximation still works ﬁne
for Diophantine irrationals, although their computation complexity grows with

their order. We come ﬁnally to the same conclusions as stated in theorem 2.5
by Braverman and Yampolsky (see [5], p. 5).
In any event, we do not agree with this assertion ([5], p. 4): ‘[...] (1

[5, 6, 13, 14, 15, 98] and ﬁnally by the author in terms of hedgehogs exclusively
[83],whereatimesavingapproachwasgiven(seeexamplesinﬁgs. 1.1.1/A-B-C
here at page 16). See also [10] for a general overview.
As we remarked in section 1.3, global graphical methods in Holomorphic
Dynamics cannot be customized to ﬁt the local conﬁgurations. Our approach,
extensivelydiscussed in [83], joinsiterationto the imitativestrategyand covers
linearizable hedgehogs exclusively.
7.5 Trends are eloquent
The last remarks on the computability of Julia sets imply that, although algo-
rithms cannot visual the dynamics attachedto Liouvillenumbers, the sequence
of nested setsE
h
(approachingθ) yields, an endlessly shrinking sequence as the
width of E
h
tends inﬁnitesimally to 0, as h→ℵ
0

without taking on the limit itself. Given θ ∈ L, one cannot obtain its value
but can at least indicate the trend of what is happening inside the sequence of
nested, arbitrarilysmall neighborhoods ofθ itself. The results we stated before
offer a response to the problem 11-b on generic angles, posed by Milnor in [64],
p. 130: the width of E
h
(the countable intersection of open sets) is always

positive, so thereexistsat least one genericvalueξ∈R inside eachE

, because
R isdense initself. In addition, themonotoneandstrictlydecreasingtrendties
to the growth terms of Cremer’s Non-linearization theorem

([64], p. 117):
Theorem 7.5.1 (Cremer Non-linearization theorem). Given λ =e

and given d≥ 2, if the d

no rational function of degree d with a ﬁxed point of multiplier λ is locally

the shrinking widths ofE
h
in the multiplicativemodel or as the limit (3.2.3) in
the the additive model overR\Z respectively.
7.6 Cremer values from a different viewpoint
Recalling the proposition 4.1.1, we claim that given a dense set E of funda-
mental points (for example, L), the zero measure set E
h
cannot include the
fundamental points exclusively and it is dense too: hence E ⊂ E
h
. Suppose
it does not. Because of the nesting relation, there are two possible cases. The
ﬁrst is E ⊇E
h
. But E⊃E
h
cannot hold because of the shrinking behavior of
the sequence E
h
. Let E≡E
h
and E
θ
h
be a sequence of sets so that E
h
shrinks
to θ (see ﬁg. 3.2.1). We can ﬁnd either an arbitrarily large index h and a
many-to-one formula f which transforms E
θ
h
into θ, that is, f(E
h
) = θ. Thus
the inverse f
−1
is a multi-valued function mapping θ back to the dense set E
h
of pointsa or, equivalently, the roots of
F(θ) :f
−1
(θ)−a = 0
are transﬁnitely many. Evidently,f
−1
cannot be a polynomial of ﬁnite degree.
In other words, one such formula F : U
k+1
→ V
k
should map a continuum U
62
George Adam Pfeiffer was the ﬁrst to attest the possibility that our quadratic polynomials with an irra-
tionally indifferent ﬁxed point could even not be linearizable inside a suﬃciently small neighborhood of the
ﬁnite ﬁxed point δ at 0.
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 101Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
of Euclidean dimension k +1 to a continuum V of dimension k, for example.
The condition k = 0 holds for the case of Liouville numbers/Cremer points,
but the same discussion could extend to Euclidean spaces of arbitrarily higher
dimensions. As we showed in section 4.9, Inverse Ackermann functions just
offer a theoretical way to make it happen although, according to our remarks
on Ackermann functions in section 6.4, we are inclined to believe that it is
improbable that one such function f
−1
is writable. The examples we gave
belong to formal systems only, whose existence is theoretical. We would crash
ontothesameproblemsthatarosefromtheBurali-Fortiparadox,whenwedealt
with the forward sequence. The relation between backward indexes would be
now restated as
Ω−1< Ω≤ Ω.
Again, the solution to move backwards from transﬁnite to ﬁnite ordinals is
theoretical exclusively.
When dealing with polynomials, the discussion requires us to be practical,
in which case the Ackermann functions work as accelerators for the speed of
coeﬃcients a
n
inside the polynomials. But the response seems to be negative
again. Otherwise one such function would offer a counter-example to the con-
cept of topological invariance, unless we do not change the terms of the input
function. Withregardtoourcontextofregularsets,thediscs(E
n
)andthelimit
value θ are not equivalent, as was also proved during the early XXth century,
most notably in the celebrated works by Brouwer in 1910 and 1911 [17, 18].
7.7 Speed affects the Julia sets topology
Following the application of the regular sets model and of the previous consid-
erations on (inverse) Ackermann functions, we found that, given a sequence of
nested sets I
n
generated by the application of a family of functions ϕ
h
, there
exists one ﬁxed pointδ∈
T
ω
0
n=1
I
n
for such sequence and it is accessible

;
2. orbycountablymanyϕ
h
whosespeedrateisasfastas(multi-)exponential
functions;
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 102Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
3. or jointly by transﬁnitely manyϕ
h
of (multi-) exponential kind.
One notices that the graphical representation of regular sets model ﬁts the
dynamics of approximating Γ-sequences, as for example in the Diophantine-
Liouville dichotomy of irrational numbers. In this sense, there exists an inter-
esting similarity with the sequence of nested sets induced by the application of
Montel’s normal families of iterates f
n≥0
near a (super-)attracting ﬁxed point
δ,f
′
(δ)< 1. On the other hand, ifδ is repelling (δ∈J),δ could be assumed as
the limit for the family of inverse maps f
n<0
converging to δ.
Perfectness and closedness are two among the classic properties of Julia
sets for iterates of polynomials in the form
d<+∞
X
i=0
a
i
z
i
. (7.7.1)
With regard to the degree of coeﬃcients exclusively, i.e. with no allusion to
the polynomial terms they belong to, we say that all a
i
are ‘linear’ in (7.7.2),
because of deg(a
i
) = 1. If at least one point of J belongs to a given backward
orbit O, then O ⊂ J. Given a transﬁnite sequence of iterates or a function
with transﬁnite speed, the points of J would be accessed by the n
th
-iterate of
any seed point z∈C\
S
B
b
whereB
b
are the basins of attraction andF is the
set of points belonging to non-repelling and periodic cycles, so thatF ⊂
S
B
b
.
If O ⊂J, most complex points would be mapped to a repelling cycle.
63
Thus
J ≡C
∞
alsodependsonF 6=∅. Wesketchoutsomeexamplesherebelow: they
show that the possibility of accomplishing O ⊂ J could offer a fuller overview
on Julia sets topologies than the approach through standard polynomials.
First, in section 6 we proved that, given the polynomial (1.1.5) withθ∈L,
theJuliasetJ
θ
isaplane-ﬁllingcurvewithHausdorffdimension2andextending
over a bounded and two-dimensional region: in fact, ∞ is a super-attracting
ﬁxed point and cannot belong toJ
θ
. Then∞∈F 6=∅ and there exists at least
one non-empty basin of attractionB
∞
.
The second exampleis the iterationofthe complexexponentialfunctione
z
.
The Julia set of e
z
was conjectured to satisfy J ≡ C
∞
by Fatou in 1926 [37].
63
One also notices here that deﬁnitions of Julia and Fatou sets swap for the families of the iterates of inverse
maps, so that the Julia set of one such family has ﬁnitely many points.
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 103Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
This was proved by Misiurewicz in 1981 [65] via one approach not involving
function speed. The iteratese
e
...
e
z
are complex Ackermann functions of (multi-
)exponential kind. There is no room here to try out a new proof of Fatou’s
conjecture of 1926, but it would be interesting to check if this approach really
works. A different strategy may stand behind the corner: since one can show
that F ≡ ∅ holds in this case and that the iterates of e
z
run as fast as Γ-
sequences in the above point 2, the repelling cycles are accessible from any
z∈C
∞
via sequences of nested subsets and it turns out that J ≡C
∞
.
A third interesting example appears in [19], p. 206, where the authors
investigated the Julia sets J of the complex iterates:
f
n
(z) =a
n
z
2
, a
n
=
1
n
1+2
n
. (7.7.2)
Br¨ uck and B¨ uger showed that J consists of the point at inﬁnity exclusively
(J ≡{∞}): J is a singleton, isolated, not perfect, not enjoying the two classic
properties of closedness and perfectness as by the Julia sets of iterated poly-
nomials (7.7.1) or of rational maps R(z) =p(z)/q(z), where p(z) and q(z) are
coprimepolynomials. Thecoeﬃcientsa
n
of (7.7.2)areInverseAckermannfunc-
tions: as n → ∞,a
n
→ 0 but now they decrease with exponential speed, i.e.
faster than the coeﬃcientsa
i
of (7.7.1).
The ﬁrst and the third example add two new entries to the standard clas-
siﬁcation of Julia sets topologies. About the ﬁrst one, the only Julia sets with
Hausdorff dimension 2 were known to satisfy J ≡C
∞
. After our proof on the
geometryofthe non-linearizablehedgehogs, the relatedcasuistryforksinto two
sub-cases, which share a transﬁnitesequence: the approximantsp
n
/q
n
→θ∈L
or the iterates ofe
z
.
Again, coeﬃcients or exponents – whose growth speeds are expressed by
Ackermann functions – may generate Julia sets whose topological properties
could offer counter-examples to the classic properties enjoyed by the iterates of
rational maps R(z), according to Fatou’s and Julia’s classic environment. For
example, the speed rates of the iterated polynomial maps in the form (7.7.1)
are evidently too slow to reach the Julia set points. This situation cannot
be obviously belong to the cases of non-linearizable hedgehogs or of Julia sets
J ≡C
∞
. So H
s
(J)< 2: J can be a connected line or totally disconnected.
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 104Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
It is clear that the features of the cases proposed do not rely on the poly-
nomial sum formula – for example, (7.7.1) –, but both on the magnitude and
on the degree of their coeﬃcients a
n
. One can generate polynomials whose co-
eﬃcients are Ackermann functions a
a
...
an
n
n
, so that the required speeds can be
obtained after a lesser amount of iterates.
The full overview of Julia sets topologies for rational and transcendental
maps seems then to involve the investigation on the degree of coeﬃcients and
on the related speed rates of iterated maps. At this point, we can sketch out
this tentative table:
64
Hausdorff dimension H

Hopefully,inlightoftheseresultsandofotheronesscatteredamongseveral
publications [19, 77, 78, 79], the corpus of the HolomorphicDynamics could be
rebuilt by improving the originalFatou-Julia approachthrough a more system-
atic attention to questions inherent to the growth speed of coeﬃcients. These
new cases could be no longer listed as exceptions, as counter-examples or as
‘pathological’.

9 Conclusions
From [83], we understand that, from both the theoretical and the empirical
viewpoint, only approximations of Siegel discs or of Hedgehogs with Siegel
compacta, endowed with positive area exclusively, are currently possible. Our
investigationsonregularsets, togetherwiththeabovediscussionontopological
invariance,suggestthatnon-linearizablehedgehogvisualizationisimpossibleon
a practical basis, even if we are able to learn their behavior overC
∞
.
In conclusion, we can state general considerations on the features enjoyed
by the construction in the ﬁnal proof and by the method developed to display
hedgehogs on computers [83]: the approach via rational approximation can
effectivelyleadtorelevantachievementsinbothtopologicalandvisualterms,as
our graphicalmethoddiscussed in[83] runs analogouslyto rationalconvergents
or to regular sets.
OurremarksaboutAckermannfunctionssuggestthatpolynomialfunctions
f
θ
in the form (1.1.5) might be just the ‘narrow door’ to hedgehogs. Such
invariant sets could be more easily tracked, and possibly occur more often for
the family of non-polynomial functions, especially exponentials.
Liouville numbers and Hedgehogs enjoy properties beyond the computa-
tional possibilities of classic mathematical approaches, just as God transcends
the cogitationbythe humanmindand senses. We can postulatetheir existence
through the clues we ﬁnd, on one hand, from the existence of limits, on the
other, from the inﬁnite beauty and complexity of Nature. To a watchful eye,
they are impossible not to notice. But the values are too little to pick up, the
speeds are too fast to follow and the entities are too big to be wrapped up:
we cannot watch hedgehogs directly (limits of graphical methods), nor we can
hopeto computeLiouvillenumbers(andirrationals,in general)viaanyprocess
developable by the ﬁniteness of human thinking (limit for processes of count-
ablymanysteps, limitsin thealgorithmicapproach, limitin theapproximation
through rational convergentsp
n
/q
n
): it is right the marginal error between our
approximationsand the effective value to decree us as losers in the war against
inﬁnity. Non-linearizable hedgehogs represent a little battle. Reason should
call fantasy to help seeing what is otherwise veiled to senses and to calculus.
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/user/diffjournal/ 106Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2007
God, inﬁnity and hedgehogs, so to come all the way down from transcendental
to concrete numerical and geometricalentities, they all belong to an outer real-
ity which we can weakly understand, necessarily requiring us to drop everyday
standards, to stop ambling and to jump into new thought patterns, as offered
by transﬁnite sequences and faith respectively.
