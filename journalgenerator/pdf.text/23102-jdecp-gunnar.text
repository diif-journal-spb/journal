Ordinary differential equations
Model map and multistability for a two predator{one prey system

Abstract. This work contains a review of some important results on a known
two predators - one prey system. We also add essential new numerical results
on multiple attractors. We consider the case when the predators coexist. We
distinguish two possibilities. The  rst is when the dynamics is well described by
the dynamics of a one dimensional map. We discuss the main behaviour of this
map. For small parameter regions the map can have two attractors but no more
than two. We give a numerical example, when these two attractors exist in the
original three-dimensional model. The second case is when this model map is
not working and something like spiral chaos often occurs. We give numerical
results showing that in this case there can be at least four different attractors
and discuss the behaviour of these.
Keywords: Bifurcations, chaos, multiple attractors, predator-prey.
1 Introduction
We consider a known system ofn predators and one prey originally represented
in [3, 4, 5] and generalized in [9]. In [11] it is shown how to rewrite it into the
formDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N. 1, 2023

wherei = 1;:::;n. The system is considered only for non-negative variables and
all parameters are positive.
We consider the case when n = 2, and we use the notations x = x

and
y =x

.
It is proved ([9, 2]), that in this case the set de ned by V < 1, where

, is positively invariant and absorbes
all solutions, where the system is de ned.
Conditions for extinction of one predator and coexistence of both can be
found in [9, 11]. A numerical overview of the behaviour of the system for
different parameters can be found in [11].
In some case the dynamics of the system is qualitatively well modelled by
a one dimensional map originally introduced in [2] and considered in [1, 10].
When this is not possible we often observe spiral-like attractors, even if up
to now there is no proof how they are related to the known spiral chaos by
Shilnikov.
If the one dimensional map works then there will be cyclic behaviour be-
tween the sum of predators x +y and the prey s. If not the behaviour is more
complicated.
We claim the one dimensional model is a good model, because all properties
in the system and the dynamics of the map are observed in both and there is
some correspondence in the sense that to any such system there are some maps
modelling it and to any map there are some systems exposing similar behaviour.
One of our aims here is to explain the main ideas of earlier works without going
into technical details, in order to make it easier to understand for the reader.
The other is to present new numerical results on multiple attrators.

Assuming

small (for example  
i

< 1 but not too small
and m

not too small, the dynamics can be qualitatively well described by the
dynamics of iterates of a map f in the Kryzhewicz form de ned as
f(x) =b +x 
k
1 +e
x
: (2)
The map has been studied in [7]. Here we shortly present some results
known about this map refering to the same source for details.
We consider the map in the parameter regionf(b;k)jk < b < k=2; k <
 4g for other parameters either the behaviour of iterates is simple or there
is an equivalent map to it in this parameter region. Here the map has two
critical points and the Schwarzian is negative so there are no more than two
attractors. Letb
1
= 2x
c
  1 e
x
c
, wherex
c
is the positive critical point, which
is a minimum. We restrict ourselves even more to parameters in the region
P
0
=f(b;k)jb
1
< b  k=2g; because outside this region there is a globally
attracting interval, where the map behaves like a known unimodal map with
only one critical point. In this region there are two attractors, but only for
narrow parameter regions. But it is known that they cannot be periodic both
with periods less than four. Also there cannot be more than one two periodic
orbit and three periodic orbits only appear in pairs, either one stable and the
other unstable or both unstable.
It is natural to de ne standard three intervals for symbolic dynamics, where
the map is monotonic. We denote by I
m
the interval ( 1; x
c
], by I
0
the
interval [ x
c
; x
c
] and by I
p
the interval [x
c
;1). Further intervals I

consist of points such that x2I

, f(x)2I
j

and f

; i = 0; 1;:::.
We say that a p-periodic orbit is of type j

After symbolp we can get only the symbolm, and the number of consequtive
m is limited by n, the smallest number such that f

) > x
c
. The fact
that 0 < f
0
< 1 on intervals I
m
and I
p
implies that there are long intervals
for iterates f
n
of the function, where f
0
< 1 thus making restrictions on the
number of periodic orbits of a given period n.

original system has a three periodic and a four periodic attractor we  nd for

3 Estimates used for construction of the model map
In the case the model map is working, we can prove the existence of a positively
invariant set of the type

, where

is de ned by the inequality s  1 "
s
; V < 1, and


4
is de ned by the inequality s
0
< 0;x +y>d(y=x;s); V < 1.
The function d is usually complicated, chosen so that s
0
< 0; V < 1 at the
point (x;y;s) for whichx+y =d(y=x;s). It is supposed that"
x
; "
y
; "
s
are small
enough. Small "
x
and "
y
implies that s
0
> 0 in 

2
. We also suppose that d is
chosen so that the dynamics is described in the following way. Any trajectory
starting on the surfaceS de ned byx+y>d(y=x;s); s =" 
2
; V < 1, enters 

1
(where x; y decrease), from which it enters 

2
(where s increases), from which
it enters 

3
(where x; y increase), from which it enters 

4
(where s decreases)
until it again hitsS. Thus there is a well de ned Poincar  e map onS. This map
is essentially one dimensional because of strong contraction in one direction and
we try here to explain (without heavy technical exact and mathematically strict
estimates) why the map de ned in (2) is a good approximation to the Poincar  e
map. We look at approximations of the trajectory in each of the sets 

i
. We
suppose the map is de ned on a line ax +by = u
0
in S, where a; b  1. We
know this is very realistic. We wish to explain as simple as possible the main
technical details given in the original work [2] and the modi cation of it in [1].
We use the following notations for points on the trajectories, where it enters
the next region. The initial point is given by coordinates (x
0
; y
0
; " 
2
). The
point of leaving 

1
and entering 

2
is denoted by (x
1
; y
1
; " 
2
), the point of
leaving 

2
and entering 

3
is denoted by (x
2
; y
2
; 1 "
s
), the point of leaving


3
and entering 

4
is denoted by (x
3
; y
3
; 1 "
s
). The  nal point on S again
is denoted by (x
4
; y
4
; " 
2
). The variable for the model map will be v = ln(
y
x
)
and we use the notations v
i
= ln(
y
i
x
i
).
Outside region 
 there is only simple dynamics or trajectories entering 
.
Similar estimates in the corresponding two dimensional predator-prey system
are obtained in [6, 8]
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2023.102 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 15Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 1, 2023
The idea of the estimates in the four regions is simple, just calculate elemen-
tary integrals under assumption that some coordinates are zero in some terms.
To get strict estimates is much more harder, even not possible in some parts and
there is a need for additional assumptions or the results get only asymptotic
values. Anyhow here we only discuss the main ideas. Using approximations in
each of the four regions we get estimates for next v
i
in terms of the previous
one and the parameters. At the end we combine all these estimates in order
to get the  nal model map in the variable v
0
. Here  rst the main ideas shortly
and after that more details.

One example of graphs showing some similarity is shown in  gure 1. We
conjecture that for any such map there are some systems with the same be-
haviour, with parameters not differing much from those used to get the model.
Finally we observe that b<k (b> 0) leads to extinction of predator y (x),
thus giving better extinction conditions than in [9, 2]
4 Multistability when the model map not working
The map (2) can have no more than two attractors. But when the model map is
not working there can be even more. In  gure 2 we  nd detected periodicities of

intersections of attractors withs =

example when a
1
= 1; a
2
= 0:0155, four regions overlap, two different for four
periodicities and one for three periodicity and the general for simple periodic
attractor. In  gure 4 we see parameter regions for the existence of three of
the attractors and how these regions overlap. Except for these three a simple
one-periodic is present in large parameter regions.
Intersections of the basins of the attractors withs
0

5 and 6.
Action of Poincar  e map on the points of the periodic attractors is shown
in  gure 7. We observe that for the Poincar  e map on s
0
= 0 one four periodic
attractor of s = 
2
; s
0
< 0 for the Poincar  e map becomes  ve-periodic.
We have also found unstable periodic orbits of periods three, four and  ve.
We give some estimates of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the Poincar  e
map at the period orbits (u = ln(s)):
  stable  xed point at v = 3:302; u = 2:727, eigenvalues of Jacobian
matrix are about 0:56  0:35i
  stable 3-periodic point at v = 2:523; u = 2:47, eigenvalues of Jacobian
matrix are about 0:22 + 0:28i
  three periodic, unstable node atv = 3:517; u = 2:07916, eigenvalues of
Jacobian matrix are about 0.05 and 2.25

In  gure 8 we show a bifurcation diagram of the behaviour of the ratio of the
predators chosinga

constant. The four periodic jumps to the 3-periodic to the left and to the 1-
periodic to the right. The  ve periodic jumps to the 4-periodic to the left and
to the 1-periodic to the right. We observe that the  ve-periodic has period four
when chosing the Poincar  e map on s =

instead of on s
