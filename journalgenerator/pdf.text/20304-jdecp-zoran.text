Abstract We provide a complete explanation of the Maxwell's equations based
on the statistical behaviour of the photons emitted/absorbed by charged parti-
cles, based on short-range massive photons and long-range photons. Then we
explain the physical phenomena of attraction/repulsion between charged parti-
cles based on the statistical effects of short-range photons. Finally, we provide
the physical explanation of the famous Tesla's scalar (longitudinal) waves based
on the theory of massive long-range photons (which have the similar behaviour
like the neutrinos).

1 Introduction
In the IQM theory there is a deeper speci cation of the state of the particle, and
in this approach to completion provided in [4], these states are speci ed by the
energy-density distributions of a given particle in the Minkowski time-space.
Such an ontic state, also not fully accessible (non fully observable by the mea-
surements, and/or with non accessible small compacti ed higher-dimensions
for the electric charge (5th timelike dimension with the coordinate q
4
= ct
4
)
and spin (6th spacelike dimension with the coordinate q
5
), for example), has
to represent the complete description of an individual elementary particle, inDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2020
order to be able to compute from it all properties of a particle as its rest-mass,
position, speed, momentum, total energy, etc...
The standard quantum theory with the probabilistic wavefunctions and their
statistical ensemble interpretation is based on the classical concept of a point-
like particle and do not have the theory able to describe an individual particle
with its trajectory and given momentum and energy in any  xed instance of
time. Because of that as noted by Einstein it was an incomplete theory, differ-
ently from the classic mechanics which has both statistical theory (for example
the thermodynamic of a gas) and theory for each individual object (Newton,
Euler-Lagrange equations for the motion of an individual object). In the pro-
posed completion of quantum theory [4] instead, an individual massive particle's
wave-packet always occupies a nonzero 3-D volume.
It was shown [1, 9, 10, 4] that, generally, any massive particle can be de ned in
the Minkowski time-space (we will not use the real higherdimensional expres-
sions but only its reduced forms to the 4-D representation) with the signature

This new IQM theory for individual particles is able to compute the spectra
of the rest-masses of the particles which is not possible to obtain with the
statistical SQM theory. Moreover, it was demonstrated that this quantum
theory completion is conservative w.r.t. the theoretical and experimental re-
sults of the statistical SQM theory. When a particle propagates in the vacuum

As shown in [4], during an inertial propagation when the particle is in a hydro-
static equilibrium, we have that  
m
is spherically symmetric around particle's
barycenter with

u (t;

so that particle's body changes dynamically its shape in time.
In the assumption [4] of the topology of the matter of an elementary massive
particle, the wave-packet do not undergo a spreading, also when it changes its
matter density distribution (i.e., its energy-density  
m
), and tends to its stable
stationary spherically symmetric distribution during inertial propagation in the
vacuum. That is, the matter has some internal self-gravitational autocohesive
force analogously to the peace of perfect uid
1
in the vacuum, so that at any
instance of time, the 3-D space topology of particle's matter distribution, and
consequently its compressible energy-density  
m
is simply connected, closed,
continuous and differentiable. Each massive elementary particle satis es the
following conservation laws:
Analogously to the Euler  rst equation of uid dynamics (continuity equation),
which represents the conservation of mass, here we have the analog equation
for the conservation of matter (that is of the particle's rest-mass energy),

We consider that the matter of an particle is a perfect uid, that is, have no shear stresses, viscosity, or
heat conduction. Perfect uids are often used in general relativity to model idealized distributions of matter,
such as the interior of a star or an isotropic universe. In general relativity, a uid solution is an exact solution
of the Einstein  eld equation in which the gravitational  eld is produced entirely by the mass, momentum, and
stress density of a uid. In astrophysics, uid solutions are often employed as stellar models. Consequently, by
the assumption that particle's material body is a perfect uid, we obtain the full physical uni cation of the QM
with universe.

It holds also for bosons when they become unstable after an initial 'space ex-
plosion' and, consequently, assume the massive particle behavior and a  nite
but non-zero energy-density volume in open 3-D space. We need that the body
of the particle  
m
provides also the physical internal pressureP (t;
  !
r ) (which is
a non-geometrical property) in order to guarantee the hydrostatic equilibrium
of the massive particles. The hydrostatic equilibrium of an massive elementary
particle demonstrated that the body of this particle  
m
is a material substance
[8], which is uid and elastic, and which can not be reduced to the time-space
geometry.
Hence, in this IQM theory [4] for individual elementary particles based on
energy-density wave-packets, the point-like particles are only the stable-state
bosons when they propagate with speed of light in the vacuum, and with their
energy-density distributed in higher compacti ed dimensions [5]. In Section 2.7
in [4], dedicated to the 3-D radial expansion of the bosons w.r.t. the direction
of particle's propagation, to the tunneling and reections, has been considered
the cylindrical expansion of the massive boson with energy density

Thus, by integration of this hyperdimensional density over 6th dimension with

than the radius of the point (boson's barycenter) which is zero, so that the
boson would become a black hole, which does not correspond to physical facts.
Note that this fact can't happen in the case when we are using the complete
6-D expression for the wave-packet, where

So, from (3) the volume of the massless boson in the ordinary 3-dimensional
space is equal to zero. Only in such conditions a particle can travel with the
maximal possible speed of light. But the matter/energy of the boson exists
also in such conditions: it is uniformly distributed only in the spacelike sixth
dimension (used for the spin) where it propagates with a constant speed v
5
.
Consequently, the hidden matter of a boson in the compacti ed higher dimen-
sions results in zero rest-mass in the ordinary at Minkowski time-space and
explains why the boson can propagate with maximal possible speed. During
this massless stable-state, the gravitational anti-black-hole barrier acting in the
boson's barycenter (in 3-D space) does not permit the leaking of the matter
from 6th into ordinary 3-dimensional space.
We consider the vacuum as the perfect 3-dimensional space symmetry where
each possible direction of the propagation has the same physical conditions.
Thus, the propagation of the particles in the vacuum is inertial and the par-
ticle propagates along GR geodesics with constant speed as a stable particle
2
.
The asymmetry due to the presence of an in nitesimal inertial particle in at
Minkowski spacetime is purely circumstantial, because the spacetime is consid-
ered to be unaffected by the presence of this particle. However, according to
general relativity, the presence of any inertial entity disturbs the symmetry of
the manifold even more profoundly, because it implies an intrinsic curvature of
the spacetime manifold, i.e., the manifold takes on an intrinsic shape that dis-
tinguishes the location and rest frame of the particle. Note that, from the fact
that the stable bosons have no matter/energy in the ordinary 3-dimensional
(open) space, the stable bosons do not generate any local time-space curva-
ture, differently from the fermions. Thus, the local time-space neighborhood
of a massless boson is always a locally at Minkowski time-space, differently

from the fermions (and also unstable massive bosons). The fact that the sta-
ble bosons have no any curved island-metrics in the ordinary 4-dimensional
time-space, results in missing of any physical resistance of the neighborhood
time-space to their propagation (differently from the massive particles with
energy-density present in the 4-dimensional time-space and, generated from it,
curved micro-island metrics). Consequently, they propagate with maximal pos-
sible speed in the ordinary 4-dimensional time-space. Thus, the bosons have the
point-like 4-dimensional structure corresponding to their position (barycenter),
but physically their total energy-density is

But there are the situations when a stable, stationary, photon becomes excited
for a short interval of time, as in the situations when the space symmetry during
its propagation is sharply broken. Thus, the time-space boundary conditions
for the particle's propagation are drastically changed, by considering that parti-
cle's wave-packet is a time-space perturbation and, if such a perturbation meets
another perturbation, it changes its form. These events we analyzed in details
later for the phenomena of refraction and 'wave-behaviors' of an individual pho-
ton [4]. In all these situations a photon may change its momentum, direction of
propagation and its velocity, without changing its total energy, because these
'interactions' are not based on collisions with another particles (as Compton
effects, or annihilations), but on instantaneous 3-D space expansions of their
geometric wave-packet scalar  eld   in the presence of a local sharply broken
space symmetry. These are strong General Relativity effects correlated with
the particle's 'micro-island' curvature metrics, caused by a dynamical changing
of the boundary conditions in the local space around this particle. This 'mate-
rialized' rest-mass m
0
of bosons can explain the following cases in the current
quantum theory:
Example 1 Current theory of a massive photon:
The photon, the particle of light which mediates the electromagnetic force is be-
lieved to be massless. The so-called Proca action describes a theory of a massive
photon [11]. These photons would propagate at less than the speed of light de-
 ned by special relativity and have three directions of polarization. However, in
quantum  eld theory, the photon mass is not consistent with gauge invariance
or renormalizability and so is usually ignored. However, a quantum theory of
the massive photon can be considered in the Wilsonian effective  eld theory ap-
proach to quantum  eld theory, where, depending on whether the photon mass
is generated by a Higgs mechanism or is inserted in an ad hoc way in the Proca
Lagrangian, the limits implied by various observations/experiments may be dif-

ferent [12].
In his 1977 paper Quark Con nement and Topology of Gauge Groups,
A.Polyakov demonstrated that instanton effects in 3-dimensional QED coupled
to a scalar  eld lead to a mass for the photon. In such a theory, its speed would
depend on its frequency, and the invariant speed c of special relativity would
then be the upper limit of the speed of light in vacuum [13]. The limit obtained
depends on the used model: if the massive photon is described by A.Proca the-
ory [12], the experimental upper bound for its mass is about 10
 57
grams [14]; if
photon mass is generated by a Higgs mechanism, the experimental upper limit
is less sharp, m = 10
 14
eV=c
2
[12] (roughly 2  10
 47
g).
The massive photons are particular cases of 'virtual' particles. Some  eld in-
teractions which may be seen in terms of virtual photons are:
- The Coulomb force (static electric force) between electric charges and the mag-
netic  eld between magnetic dipoles. They are caused by the exchange of virtual
photons;
- The so-called near  eld of radio antennas, where the magnetic and electric
effects of the changing current in the antenna wire and the charge effects of
the wire's capacitive charge are detectable, but both of which effects decay with
increasing distance from the antenna much more quickly than do the inuence
of conventional electromagnetic waves, and which are composed of real photons.
2 Breaking of 3-D Space-symmetry and Boson's Space
Explosion
Here, instead of "spontaneous symmetry breaking", we will consider only phys-
ically and deterministically generated 3-D space breaking symmetry for a free
boson when it interacts with another massive particle at a short distance from
this boson. In such a mechanism we do not have to introduce any new kind
of bosons like Higgs bosons, and this physical process may explain the phe-
nomena of the abstract "spontaneous symmetry breaking" of the (gauge)  eld
equations. More precisely, this initial 'inationary' process (which apparently
generates the energy in the ordinary 3-D space from the previously zero-energy
at the bosons barycenter in 3-D space) of a spherical inationary expansion of
the bosons is done by the leaking of the energy density contained in a com-
pacti ed extremely small higher space dimension into the ordinary 3-D open
space around the particle's barycenter. So, the 3-D volume of a boson becomes
an in nitesimally small sphere of energy-density with a radius bigger than the
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 65Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2020
Schwarzschild radius (thus, without a creation of a black hole). After this ini-
tial explosion this boson continues its radial space expansion (now against its
matter-autocohesive self-gravitational forces, that generate an internal poten-
tial energy taken from the kinetic energy of this massive boson, and hence with
a process of deceleration from the speed of light) and behaves as the ordinary
fermions with a rest-mass greater than zero.
Notice that when a boson is stable also in its barycenter, de ned by the Dirac
function (3) of  , the energy-density is zero, so that stable boson is not a mi-
croscopic black hole.
In effect, this extremely small compacti ed spacelike dimension is strongly
curved because of the presence of the boson's energy in it. If such a 'rest-mass'
boson's energy would enter in the open 3-D space, from the bosons barycenter
(which is just a point in 3-D space) it would generate extremely strong gravita-
tional force in the open 3-D space and consequently a microscopic black-hole.
It is just this extreme force that guarantee the stability of the massless bosons
with a delimitation of the boson's total energy-density only in this higher com-
pacti ed spacelike dimension. This equilibrium is rendered unstable only when
another massive particle with its micro-island curved 4-D time-space interferes
in the multidimensional time-space manifold with the higher dimension of the
boson where is contained its total energy; this interferences of the curved mul-
tidimensional time-space metrics of the boson and another particle generates a
new common time-space curvature for both particles in which it is possible this
process of passing the bosons energy-density from a compacti ed into the open
3-D space without generation of a black-hole.
The microscopical 'big-bang inationary' process of 3-D space expansion of the
energy-density in fact avoids the transformation of the previously stable boson
into a black-hole, as it is considered in the cosmological gravitational theory
of 'big-bang', with a difference that here the amount of energy involved in this
expansion is in nitesimal w.r.t. the cosmological big-bang. The radius of this
3-D small sphere (which contains the rest-mass energy of this massive boson)
after this microcosmic big-bang is signi catively bigger than the Schwarzschild
radius, so that it is avoided the generation of a microscopic black-hole.
This extremely small sphere of the massive boson can have other radial expan-
sions as other massive particles, and the cylindrical extreme expansions (as in
the case of the electrons in the double-slit experiments) described in [7].
When the boson in this unstable massive state bypasses the material obsta-
cle (the strongly curved 'island' metric of this obstacle) and now continues its
propagation again in a locally at Minkowski time-space, the autocohesive self-
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 66Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2020
gravitational forces (and internal potential energy developed during the space
expansion against these autocohesive forces) determine the inverse process of
space implosion of the boson's energy-density in the open 3-D space. Succes-
sively, by an inverse non-linear process, instead to become a point-like particle
with whole energy concentrated in the single point of the boson's barycenter
which would generate a black-hole in 3-D space, this energy density is again
expelled from the 3-D space and conserved into the 6th compacti ed dimen-
sion. At the end of this implosion, the gravitational barrier in the point of
the boson's barycenter is recreated again, making stable this boson with the
rest-mass equal to zero and with zero 3-D volume of its matter/energy-density.
During this implosion process, the previously generated (by expansion) internal
potential energy is restituted to the kinetic energy of this still massive parti-
cle, so that we have a progressive acceleration of this boson, whose rest-mass
progressively reduces in proportion of how much the energy-density is expelled
from the 3-D space and hence, in the moment when the whole energy is expelled
into the 6th dimension of the particle's barycenter, this boson becomes again a
massless particle propagating with the speed of light.
Consequently, if a massless particle with total energy E does not propagate in
the free space but very near to another massive particles, then we can obtain
a spatial explosion into a microscopic (quasi-in nitesimal) sphere with highly
compressed energy/density  
m
, and consequently very high positive potential
energyV , so that it becomes massive boson with rest massm
0
=

c
2
. So, based
on this positive internal (selfgravitational) energy V , a radial expansion begins
by progressive deceleration of particle's velocity. If another massive particles
are relatively far from its trajectory this expansion will be up to the reaching of
the equilibrium state of this massive particle with rest-massm
0
. Otherwise can
be very signi cant (with cylindrical expansion described in [7], by transforming
its matter-distribution in a radial disc w.r.t. the direction of the propagation,
and with generation of the negative potential energy V (subtracted from the
kinetic energy) as it was considered above for the ordinary fermions.

degrees continuously from the initial speed of light v(0) =c to the  nal veloc-
ity v(4t) < c. That is, during a deceleration with time-dependent particle's
velocity v(t), so that this velocity decrease corresponds to the time-dependent
changing of massive-boson's internal potential energy V (t) [7].

In this initial 3-D space explosion, its matter density expands from
higher dimensions into a micro-sphere (with a radius greater than Schwarzschild
radius) with an energy density  
m
and a non-observable internal potential en-
ergy V (t). So, we consider the transformation of a massless into a massive
boson, during time interval 0 < t 4t, which propagates with a decreasing
speed v(t) < c, from its initial speed of light t = 0, v(0) = c, into the  nal
velocity v(4t) < c, by preserving the following dynamic relativistic dispersion

which does not participate in the conservation law during collisions but only
as an internal potential energy (during the self-gravitational internal stability
process). In fact, in the case when we have a direct collision with another par-
ticle (Compton effect), this massive boson has the observable (used in collision
and energy/momentum conservation of Compton effects) energyE =p
0
c as for
the massless boson, and hence during the collisions we have preserved ordinary
laws of conservation of the energy and momentum.
The meaning ofV is the following: for a stable boson whenv =# =c, we have
that V = 0 and m
0
= 0, so that (4) reduces to E =p
0
c, as expected.
In the case of an unstable massive boson which propagates with the speed
0<v<c, the small mater-density expansion of this unstable boson 'generates'
a temporary internal potential energyV > 0 of the 3-D space explosion and de-
termines the appearance of the non-zero  nite matter-distribution volume and,
hence, the manifestation of the rest-mass m
0
. This internal potential energy is
a consequence of the radial expansion of this massive boson: it generates the
pressure force against the self-gravitational forces generated by the presence
of boson's energy density in 3-D space. This process ends when this massive
boson bypasses material obstacle (which caused its 3-D space explosion) and
continues again the propagation inside the symmetric 3-D vacuum space. In
that moment we have the inverse process of implosion during which this massive
boson becomes again a stable massless boson with Dirac function distribution
in 3-D space, zero 3-D volume of its energy-density and zero rest-mass. How-
ever, if this process of expansion is enough time long (as in the case of the large
massive barriers in front of the boson's propagation, producing the reection or
tunneling of this boson, or in double-slit experiments) then this massive particle
(now with constant m
0
(4t) rest-mass) continues to expand over its autoequi-
librium state, so that V begins to decrease (now, instead of (4), for t >4t,

(t) must be satis ed) and hence decreases the
momentump(t), the speed and kinetic energy. In fact, the decrease ofV during
expansion of particle's body means that this amount is subtracted from the
kinetic energy when the volume of matter is expanded w.r.t. to its hydrostatic
equilibrium volume. This energy (subtracted from the kinetic energy so that
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 69Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2020
particle decreases its speed) is used to overcome the resistance of the autoco-
hesive self-gravitational force during radial expansion.
For example, we know that in the medium different from vacuum (air, glass,
water, etc...) the group velocity of light (photons) v is less than c. Thus,
we have the statistical effects of a numerous expansions of the Dirac energy-
distribution which happens when the photon's trajectory passes very near to
the massive particles in this medium as anticipated in [4]. The velocity of light
in this medium is an average value of the effects of such numerous expansions
of each single photon during the propagation in this medium. It is well known
that the refractive index of such medium is n =
c
#
> 1, thus with the phase
velocity # less than the speed of light. However, also for the cases when re-
fractive index is less than 1 (interactions of photons with plasma medium, for
example), when #>c the relationship above is satis ed with smaller values of
the photon (group) velocity v, so that in such a medium, the group velocity
of light is always less than the speed of light c in the vacuum. Notice that a
transformation from stable into massive bosons happens also when a photon
passes from the vacuum into an medium with the refractive indexn =
c
#
, where
# is the phase velocity of the light in this medium and
@n
@ 
is an experimentally
determined dependence of the refractive index on the wave-length   =~

of
the photons.
Measurement of massive boson's rest-mass: Thus, we are able to measure
the rest-mass of the massive bosons if we know the energy E of the photons in
the vacuum and if we measure the group velocity v of the photons (light) in
this refractive medium. In fact, based on the Rayleigh law, we have that,
v =

where h is Plank constant and p is the momentum of this massive photon

for the known energy E of the photon and measured speed v in this refrac-
tive medium, the momentum p of the photon during the propagation in the
medium, from above, by

3 Theory of Long-range and Short-range Photons
This phenomena of a temporal transformation of the massless bosons into mas-
sive bosons is used to explain a number of examples, in the case of the photons,
like the refraction, reection and double-slit experiments. However, we need
also the complementary part of this phenomena, especially for the theory of
emission of photons from the charged massive particles, fundamental also for
the short range interactions (in contrast to massless bosons and their long range
interactions strictly connected with the transmission of the gauge  eld energies
as, for example, the Poynting vector

tromagnetic power-ow for the transverse electromagnetic waves). Maxwell's

composition of the plain waves. Maxwell's equations explain how these waves

can physically propagate through the 3-D space. The changing magnetic  eld
creates a changing electric  eld through Faraday's law. In turn, that electric
 eld creates a changing magnetic  eld through Maxwell's addition to Ampere's
law. This perpetual cycle, which satisfy, for the frequency   and wavelength ,

In particular, in next, we will consider the emission of "virtual" (i.e., massive)
photons, which usually happens in the following situations:
  The Coulomb force (static electric force) between electric charges and the
magnetic  eld between magnetic dipoles. They are caused by the exchange
of virtual photons.
  The so-called near  eld of radio antennas, where the magnetic and electric
effects of the changing current in the antenna wire and the charge effects
of the wire's capacitive charge are detectable, but both of which effects
decay with increasing distance from the antenna much more quickly than
do the inuence of EM waves.
The common property for all these phenomena is that we have no any trans-
mission of the electromagnetic energy, that is, we have no the phenomena of
radiation waves.
So, the massive photons, that explain these three phenomena above, are physi-
cally different from the photons which would have the long-range interaction by
generating the electromagnetic waves with consecutive transfer of the emitted

energy from the source charged particles (the accelerated electrons, for exam-
ple) into the space:
1. Emission of the long-range photons: It is natural to suppose that in
the moment of any generation of a new photon, it passes from its excited un-
stable state with a 'materialized' rest-mass and with its velocity v less than
the velocity
  !
c of light in the vacuum, and after very short interval of time in
the free 3-D space (vacuum) of propagation, it reaches its stable (stationary)
state with velocity of light and the energy-density

) (12)
The distance that such a massive photon passes in this unstable (unstationary)
initial state, in order to become the massless photon, must be very short. Thus,
such emitted log-range photons must have an in nitesimal 3-D volume with very
high energy-density inside it, so that the self gravitational force inside this vol-
ume is very high and tends to decrease the volume of this massive photon. The
decreasing of its volume must be obtained by a continuous expelling of the ini-
tial amount of the energy inside photon's 3-D body into higher dimensions, in
order to avoid the process of a generation of a black hole. So, by maintaining
the initial momentum (when this photon is generated and emitted by a charged
particle) and by decreasing its rest-mass energy, that is, the rest-mass of this
massive photon, the speed of this massive photon necessarily increments. Con-
sequently, at the end of this continuous process, when the whole energy of the
photon is expelled from its 3-D space into the higher dimensions, we obtain the
zero 3-D volume massless photon, which propagates with the speed of light in
the vacuum. Thus, in such a creation of a long-range photon, the source charged
massive particle loses an amount of energy, used to generate this photon. For
example, it happens when such a photon is irradiated from the electron in an
atom and, consequently, this electron passes to the lower energy-level.
Let us show that indeed such long-range massless photons, that satisfy the
equation (12) above, generate statistically the well-known Hertzian transverse
electromagnetic wave, with the propagation of their wave energy by the speed
of light in the vacuum.
Let us consider the case of the simple plain wave, a linearly polarized solution
of Maxwell's equations (8), generated by the antenna dipole (for example the

and hence (19) reduces to the continuity equation of a single massless photon

Note that the same result we obtain also for a continuous dense laser stream
of coherent photons, which generate classical linearly-polarized plain wave, sat-
isfying the simple mono-frequency solution (15) with k =

, where p is the
momentum of such plain wave, with the surface equal to the cross-section sur-
face of such laser's beam. Similarly, it can be demonstrated for any kind of
polarization of the propagating electromagnetic wave.
Notice that in the direction of the propagation of a polarized plane wave (for
example, in x direction, orthogonal to the dipole antenna emitter) we have no
the electric effects, but only the propagation of the energy of photons in this
optical beam. The only electric effects are transversal to the direction of the
propagation of such beam of photons, cause by the vector potential

A which
direction is initially  xed by the direction of the electrons (the emitters of these
long-range photons) in the antenna's current ! That is, the transversal move-
ments of the photons in a linearly polarized plain wave (the direction of this
movement is just the direction of the polarization vector of this plane wave)
generate the electric  eld of such a polarized plain wave. When this plain wave
reachs a receiver, theses transversal momentum components of these long-range
photons generate the movement of the free electrons in this receiver and hence
the electric current (the statistical electromagnetic effect in the receiver). So,
in this way, the transversal movement (momentum) of the photons, w.r.t. the
direction of plain-wave propagation, is the generator of the vector potential

and transmission of the signals from the dipole antenna emitter and a receiver.
Let us consider a tube in the vacuum from which comes out a water with a
strong pressure as a concentrated beam of water molecules. It is similar to a
beam of photons emitted from a laser. If we now move the end of this tube up-
down harmonically with displacement less than the radius of the water beam,
the person which will be at some distance in front of this water-beam would  ll
this up-down water wave and the constant longitudinal pressure of the water
beam (which is constant and hence non-wave). This transversal up-down water
wave is similar to the up-down polarized transversal electromagnetic wave com-
posed on photons. Thus, in both cases we generated the waves in the vacuum;
one composed on the fast moving molecules of water and another composed
on photons. Thus, it con rms the Einstein, we do not need the aether differ-
ent from the gravitational potential. Hence, the deterministic part of quantum
theory (IQM) is in accordance with classical (statistical) Maxwell's theory for

2. Emission of the short-range photons: In this case, the interactions
of electrons and photons are based on these unstable photons with 'material-
ized' rest-mass (short distance interaction). Thus, we have that in the case of

charged fermion (as electron, for example), these short-range massive photons
must be constantly emitted in all radial directions from this charged fermion,
so that the number N >> 1 of emitted photons must be very high at each
 xed instance of time. Consequently, the energy E of each photon is much
smaller than the energy of the long-range photons. However, in order to main-
tain the constant energy-level of the charged fermion, it means that practically
all of irradiated short-range photons will come back to be absorbed by the same
fermion. So, the total emitted energy from a charged fermion corresponds to
the total absorbed energy of the same fermion. The same happens also for the
total momentum: from the fact that the emission of these short-range photons
is in all radial directions and with the equal density, the total momentum of all
irradiated photons, in each instance of time, is ideally zero (the same holds for
the absorbed short-range photons). So, the movement of this charged fermion
is ideally invariant w.r.t. the emissions and absorptions of the short-range pho-
tons, if we have no another charged fermions near to this observed charged
fermion. Only if there are another signi catively near charged fermions, this
balance will be changed, and we will discuss these phenomena in next Section.
4 How Do Photons Generate the Attraction/Repulsion
between Charged Particles?
We assume that the positively charged elementary particle emits the ordinary
matter photons, while the negative charged particle emits the antimatter pho-
tons. For the massless photons they are equal. However, the electron-emitted
massive photon will be an antiparticle which has negative value of density

range massive photon has an exactly pre xed value. Any single short-range
photon emitted by a given charged fermion (based on the general framework
for the emission of the short-range photons presented in the end of Section 3),
if it will not have the interaction with other charged particles then it will come
back to this charged fermion. Thus, it will start the propagation with a high
initial speedv(0) (at initial timet = 0) from the emitter and then will deceler-
ate up to the momentt
s
> 0 when will be arrested at some distancer
s
from the
emitter. After that, the inverse process of accelerated propagation toward this
charged fermion (emitter) will initiate, so that, ideally, its speed at any  xed
distancer r
s
will be the same, but in the inverse radial direction w.r.t to the
speed that it has at this distance during 0<t t
s
.
If we denote the moment of the absorption, of this massive photon with small
rest-mass m
0
, by t
f
then, ideally, we have that v(t
f
) = v(0), so that it re-
turns with the opposite (to the initial) momentum. From the fact that the
total energy E of this photon is not changed, after its absorption, the perfect
energy equilibrium of the emitter is established. From the fact that emission of
this photon is balanced by contemporary emission of another photon with the
same momentum but in the opposite direction (from the surface of the opposite
part of emitter's body), the momentum of the charged emitter remains invari-
ant. From the fact that this short-range boson is arrested at a characteristic
distance r
s
from the emitter, and the fact that this photon is uncharged (and
also the gravitational force between its extremely small rest mass m
0
and the
massive charged emitter can be neglected, we need to de ne a model for an in-
ternal short-range massive photon dynamics which produces such a propagation
process during 0 t t

We consider that, at the initial time t = 0 of generation of a massive photon,
in the reference frame with the center at charged emitter particle, it obtains an
initial internal (non observable) energy

This positive internal energy corresponds to the super-pressure inside massive photons body, because this
photon is generated inside the charged particle where the pressure is high. So, when it is expelled from the
emmiter's body into the vacuum, this internal pressure is higher than the hydrostatic pressure of this massive
photon and hence begins the process of body expansion of this photon when it is expelled from the charged
emitter.

photon is in rest (all these three properties have the pre xed values, equal for
each emitted short-range massive photon). Consequently, the 'virtual particle'
energy relationship, analog to (4) but now in different dynamics from that of
massless boson explosion (because our short-range photon is created as massive
from the very beginning) holds, for t  0, from (4)

so that
v(t
s
) = 0 and V (t
s
) = 0, that is, the internal energy is completely consumed
for the extension of this photon up to its rest). So, the photon's deceleration
from initial speedv(0) to the zero speed att =t
s
, is explained by the progressive
decreasing of the internal energy (from maximal V (0) to minimal V (t
s
) = 0),
because this energy is used for the (dominant) longitudinal expansion (against
internal self-gravitational forces) of photon's body in direction of propagation,
during 0<t t
s
.
Physically, it looks like that this longitudinal expansion of photon's body (analog
to the case of the radial expansion of particle's body during its perfect reection
from a massive large barrier orthogonal to the propagation of this particle, when
the kinetic energy is again used against self-gravitational forces [7] during such
radial expansion) consumes the kinetic energy of this massive photon, withE +
V (0)>E +V (t)> 0 where the observable energy E remains invariant.
However, differently from the case of the elastic reection from a massive large
barrier, during an extreme radial expansion of a massive particle, which con-
sumes all its kinetic energy for such a radial expansion and we obtain the
complete arrest of the particle in front of the barrier surface, here in the case
of the short-range photons (or other bosons as well), we have no any barrier
which prohibits to this massive photon to continue to move in another direction
instead to come back to its emitter. We have here the following phenomena:
when the longitudinal expansion is interrupted and this massive photon is ar-
rested, now the self-gravitational forces (after spending previously all kinetic
energy and hence the internal energy) are dominant. Thus, the inverse pro-
cess of (dominant) longitudinal restriction starts, and from the fact that the
main density is in the back particle's side, we have the dominant restriction
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 79Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2020
of the front part of this massive particle. Consecutively, main internal move-
ment of the energy-density inside photon's body is just in the opposite direction
w.r.t. previous direction of photon's propagation. This internal movement of
the rest-mass energy generates now a momentum in this opposite direction,
that is, toward the charged fermion (the emitter of this photon). Thus, now we
have the acceleration toward the emitter of this photon, i.e., an inverse internal
dynamics, where the work done by the self-gravitational forces during the lon-
gitudinal restriction of photon's body is used to increment its internal energy
V (t) during t>t
s
, and hence the photon's kinetic energy and velocity.
In an ideal situation, when we have no any charged particle except the photon's
emitter, in the time-instancet
f
when this returned photon will be absorbed by
the emitter, the velocity and momentum of this photon will be equal of that dur-
ing its emission but in the opposite direction. Consequently,
  !
p (0)+
  !
p (t

) = 0.
Moreover, the time t

, and the maximal distance r
s
from the emitter are equal
for all short-range massive photons.
So, in such an ideal case with the vacuum around the emitter, its cloud of emit-
ted and then absorbed short-range massive photons would generate a perfect
sphere around this emitter, with the density of this claude of photons which
depends only on the distance r  r

from the emitter. That is, this density
  of short-range massive photons of this isolated charged emitter is, from the

that the self-interaction of the photons generated by an emitter is very limited,
similarly to the ordinary point-like long-range photons. This density of emitted
massive photons, each one with its momentum, generates the radial electric

electromagnetic phenomena is obtained by the electrostatic potentials (moving
or not w.r.t. a given reference frame) of the individual charged particles. That
is, all electromagnetic  elds can be explained by the electrostatic scalar  elds
of the charged particles, which are the statistical results of the dense clouds
of the short-range massive photons (emmited/absorbed by each charged parti-
cle) which move together with their charged emitters. We obtained  nally the

of photons as required by Einstein. This relativistic (w.r.t. a given reference

. Note that the second continuity equation (which is physi-
cally the conservation law) in (29) above is just mathematically the Lorenz
gauge condition.
Differently from the long-range photons emitted by charged particle non con-
tinuously but only in the speci c acceleration conditions (so that they can have
very different energies), the short-range massive photons have practically the
same energy E, in nitesimal rest-mass m
0
and initial speed v and are continu-
ously emitted (with the same frequency) in each radial direction from a given
charged particle.
If we assume that the massive photons generated by a positively charged par-
ticle are made of matter, that is with   > 0 inside their body-volume, the
massive photons generated by a negatively charged particle are made of an-
timatter, that is with   < 0. Thus, the short-range massive photons of an
electron and a proton are two perfect antiparticles, with the same rest mass
m
0
. So, we have the annihilation between two massive photons, one generated
by electron and another generated by a proton, during their collisions. From
the fact that they are very low energy antiparticles, after such an annihilation,
the two new matter-antimatter photons are regenerated again, with the same
rest-masses m
0
and energy E, but not with the same momentum p that they

have before the annihilation. That is, the internal energies V of these regener-
ated pair particle/antiparticle massive photons can be different than they had
before the impact in order to satisfy the energy relationship (21).
Let us consider now what kind of dynamics of massive photons happen between
two charged massive particles. We considered that in an 'isolated' situation,
when a single charged particle is in the vacuum (at distance r > r
s
from any
other charged particle), so that there is no any interaction between the short-
range photons of this emitter with another charged particle, we have perfect
spherically symmetric emission/absorption of massive photons of this 'isolated'
charged particle. We consider that the absorbed massive photons with their
momentum generate a pressure (force density) on the emitter's surface. Thus,
in this ideal equilibrium (corresponding to the minimal activity of the emission
of the short-range photons and hence the minimal energy4E of the charged
particle is used to generate a claud of massive photons around it in a given
instance of time t), we have the equal pressure-force (caused by absorption of
this cloud of short-range photons) on the emitter's surface from all radial direc-
tions. This equilibrium is broken when we have another charged particle at a
distancer<r
s
, because now from this radial direction the observed emitter re-
ceives a higher density of the massive photons, caused by the irradiation of the
short-range photons also from this new charged particle. From the fact that,
for any received massive photon, the charged particle responds by the emission
of a new massive photon, and the fact that this charged particle tries to remain
in the equilibrium (its natural "minimal energy dispersion"4E state with the
minimal electrodynamic activity), now the distribution of the new generated
short-range photons over whole emitter's surface changes: the maximal number
(in a given instance of time) of emitted photons is achieved from the small part
of the emitter's surface oriented toward the other charged particle, and minimal
from the opposite side of the surface of this emitter.
That is, the maximal intensity of the emission/absorption of the short-range
massive photons is concentrated in the part of the emitter's surface oriented
toward other charged particle (which suffers the same electrodynamic emis-
sion/absorption effect) and minimal intensity on the emitter's surface on the
opposite side. The integral (over particle's surface in a given instance of time),
of the whole irradiated energy used for the generation and emission of the new
photons, tends naturally to be minimized and to converge to minimal activity-
state energy4E. So, we consider the two possible cases:
  Between two charged particles with the same charge sign:
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 84Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2020
In this case these two charged particles are repelled because a number of
massive photons emitted by the  rst charged particle will be absorbed by
the another charged particle. So, the momentum of these massive pho-
tons will produce an additional pressure to another charged particle which
absorbed them, and this generates the repulsive Coulomb force. It is intu-
itively easy to understand: as described above the intesity/density of the
emitted/absorbed massive photons is bigger between these two charged
particles w.r.t. the their opposite sides. So, the pressure force of the
absorbed photons to any charged particle coming from another charged
particle is bigger than the opposite pressure force acting on its opposite
surface-side, and hence these two charged particles are repelled. That is,
the pressure of the cloud of massive photons between two charged particles
is greater than that on their opposite surface-sides.
  Between two charged particles with the opposite charge sign:
In this case, we have an attractive Coulomb force between these two
charged particles, which is not so intuitively easy to understand. We have
seen that the emission of a massive photon with a given small momentum
does not change the momentum of the emitter, because in the opposite
side of this emitter is also emitted (statistically) another massive boson
with the same but opposite momentum direction. The same fact happens
for the returned and absorbed massive photons of the same emitter: if a
charged particle is in vacuum, far from other charged particle, the returned
massive photons will have the same value but in opposite directions. So,
we have the attraction between these two opposite charged particles only
when the previously emitted photon in the direction of another charged
particle returns back (to be absorbed by its emitter) with smaller momen-
tum. Indeed, during the collisions between the massive photons moving
toward the oppositely charged particle, we have the annihilations of the
photons and corresponding anti-photons (emitted from the positive and
negative charged particles respectively). After such an annihilation, these
two massive photon/anti-photon are regenerated, with the same rest mass
m
0
and energy E, but with opposite and very small momentum w.r.t the
momentum that they had before the annihilation. Consequently, when
these regenerated photons are reabsorbed by their own emitters, we ob-
tain that the absorbed photons from the opposite side of each of these
two charged emitters have greater momentums w.r.t to these regenerated
between these two opposite-charged particles. The  nal result is that we
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 85Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2020
obtain the attraction between these two oppositely charged particles.
In fact, with these massive-photon/antiphoton annihilations, we obtain
that the pressure of the absorbed photons between two oppositely charged
particles is diminished w.r.t to the standard pressure that charged particles
receive from the other radial directions from their own clouds of short-range
massive photons.
This electrostatic attracive/repelling force between two charged particles, with
charges q
1
and q
2
respectively, corresponds to the Lorentz force of the radial
electrostatic  eld (23) of the  rst charged particle (proportional to the density
of its emitted short-range photons at the distancer, between these two charged
particles) to the electric charge q

5 Tesla's Scalar Waves
"Towards the close of 1898 a systematic research, carried on for a number of
years with the object of perfecting a method of transmission of electrical energy
through the natural medium, led me to recognize three important necessities:
First, to develop a transmitter of great power; second, to perfect means for in-
dividualizing and isolating the energy transmitted; and, third, to ascertain the
laws of propagation of currents through the earth and the atmosphere. Various
reasons, not the least of which was the help proffered by my friend Leonard E.
Curtis and the Colorado Springs Electric Company, determined me to select for
my experimental investigations the large plateau, two thousand meters above

1899. I had not been there but a few days when I congratulated myself on the
happy choice and I began the task, for which I had long trained myself, with a
grateful sense and full of inspiring hope." -Nikola Tesla, Serbian-American in-
ventor (Communicated to the Thirtieth Anniversary Number of the Electrical
World and Engineer, March 5, 1904.)
Wardenclyffe Tower (1901-1917), also known as the Tesla Tower, was an early
experimental wireless transmission station designed and built by Nikola Tesla
in Shoreham, New York in 1901-1902. Contrary to popular belief his tower was
not built to radiate Hertzian (transverse) waves into the air. Tesla's system
was used to send out thousands of horsepower through the earth- he has shown
experimentally how power can be sent without wires over distances from a cen-
tral point. Tesla intended to transmit messages, telephony and even facsimile
images across the Atlantic to England and to ships at sea based on his theories
of using the Earth to conduct the signals.
Nikola Tesla invented the modern age, patenting every form of modern tech-
nology or it's conception as it's basis for today

. Many inventions attributed
to others were  rst developed by Tesla. Marconi's admitted to using Tesla's
earlier patented work for research and his 1894 "Shadow Graphs" that predated
Wilhelm Roentgen X-Rays in 1895. He publicly stated his conception of the

Nikola Tesla was born in a Serbian family 1856 in the small village of Smiljan. After  nishing high school
in Croatia, he continued his education in engineering in Graz, Austria, until 1878. Four years later he moved
to Paris, France, and started working for the Continental Edison Company. In 1884 he emigrated to the
United States, where he  rst began to work with Thomas Edison but soon afterward formed his own Tesla
Corporation as competition to Edison's company. He patented about 300 inventions worldwide, many of which
are still famous today. Courtesy of the Tesla Museum, Belgrade, Serbia. Fortunately for me, I have studied
the Electrical engineering at ETF, Nikola Tesla, at Belgrade, where I obtained the Assistant professor position
for electromagnetic, microwave and laser techniques, immediately after my Msc at Telecommunications (when
I was 27 years old).

no target electrode; therefore, electrons were accelerated by peaks of the electri-
cal  eld produced by the high-voltage Tesla coil. Even then, Tesla realized that
the source of x-rays was the site of the  rst impact of the "cathodic stream"
within the bulb, which was either the anode in a bipolar tube or the glass wall
in the unipolar tube he invented. Nowadays, this form of radiation is known
as Bremsstrahlung or braking radiation. In the same article, he stated that
the cathodic stream was composed of very small particles (ie, electrons). His
idea that the produced rays were minute particles was not wrong at all; many
years later, physicists described particle properties of electromagnetic radiation
quanta called photons. It is really di cult to  nd a well de ned concept for the
"scalar waves", so I can take this one,  nd in popular web sources
6
:
"Scalar waves also referred to as Tesla waves or longitudinal waves are capable
of penetrating any solid object including Faraday cages. A transmitter can be
placed in a box of thick metal and a receiver outside of the box will still receive
the scalar wave. Scalar waves are capable of passing through the earth from
one side to another with no loss of  eld strength as Tesla showed in one of his
experiments... Scalar Waves are not electromagnetic but composed of pure zero
point energy. They also have the potential to be used as a power source. Some
point to the 1908 Tunguska event as Tesla's own proof of concept test. So scalar
waves can be used for communication, energy, and other applications. Scalar
waves (longitudinal waves) do what transverse waves cannot. They are fast,
penetrating, connected, and can broadcast magni ed power. Their potential is
almost limitless..."
or the following

:
"Scalar waves were originally detected by a Scottish mathematical genius called
James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) He linked electricity and magnetism laying
the foundation for modern physics, but unfortunately the very  ne scalar waves
(which he included in his research) were deliberately left out of his work by the
3 men, including Heinrich Hertz, who laid down the laws taught for physics as
a discipline at colleges. They dismissed Maxwell's scalar waves or potentials
as 'mystical' because they were physically unmanifest and only existed in the
'ethers' and so were determined to be too ineffectual for further study. These
enigmatic (but more powerful than even microwaves when harnessed and con-
centrated into a beam) scalar waves may have been forgotten except that Nikola
Tesla accidentally rediscovered them... By 1904, Tesla had developed trans-

mitters to harness scalar energy from one transmitter to another, undetectably
bypassing time and space. He could just materialize it from one place to an-
other through hyperspace, without the use of wires, it was just sucked right out
of the space-time/vacuum and into a transmitter and into a beam which could
be targeted to another transmitter. Unfortunately he got no  nancial support
for replacing electricity, which used wires and therefore earned money, and to
this day, this is the reason why scalar energy is still not acknowledged in main-
stream physics."
Consequently, in the absence of the scienti cally accepted opinions, I will con-
sider as trusted basis only the Tesla's experimental proofs, that is, that the
scalar waves are not the transverse plain (spherical) waves for which we know
that are composed by the stable point-like zero rest-mass photons that propa-
gate with maximal possible velocity of light (in the vacuum or quasi-vacuum)
after some distance from the antenna.
So, the transmission of the energy by these waves (composed by the bosons in
their particular conditions) can not be obtained by the Poynting vector which
represents the directional energy ux (the energy transfer per unit area per
unit time) of a transverse electromagnetic  eld (where the electric and mag-
netic  elds are mutually orthogonal lying in the plain which is orthogonal to
the direction of the wave propagation). We know that, from the Maxwell's
theory, that the Poynting vector is zero only if the vector product of electric
and magnetic  elds is zero. This fact is con rmed also by Tesla's observation
that "Scalar waves are capable of passing through the earth from one side to
another with no loss of  eld strength", and if such a wave would have electric
component different from zero, from the fact that earth is semi-conductor, we
would have enormous loosing of the energy of such a wave.
Nikola Tesla advanced the electromagnetism theory into new dimensions, fur-
ther than Hertz and other scientists of his time could conceive. He described his
"wireless" waves being far superior to Hertzian (transverse) waves, which dimin-
ish with distance. Tesla foretold of a brilliant new future for humankind, using
his non-Hertian "wireless system," including the ability to generate power and
transmit it to various parts of the globe. Tesla wanted to harness the ground
to utilize his technology; however, with the Hertzian system the atmosphere is
used as the medium and ground is not a major part of the design.
Tesla considered the entire terrestrial globe to be an electrical conductor that
could be made to resonate at different frequencies. Moreover, the earth had
various terrestrial resonances, which could be "tuned" or tapped into, provid-

ing planet Earth's citizens with a clean and inexhaustible source of energy.
After the many years of research into his concept of electromagnetic wave prop-
agation through the earth or ground, Tesla was able to re ne and perfect his
inventions. More and more, Tesla's inner mind conceived this new kind of en-
ergy and the effects it would have on our science. Nikola Tesla showed he could
send electrical energy without wires. It turned out not to be good for business
and it was also classi ed. He used longitudinal waves. The  eld pointer travels
in the direction of propagation, much like sound waves and plasma waves do.
Their potential is \scalar" but longitudinal wave vectors can be produced from
them. However, they are simply called \scalar waves." He described this energy
as having the ability to be transmitted to any distance without any loss:
"That electrical energy can be economically transmitted without wires to any ter-
restrial distance, I have unmistakably established in numerous observations, ex-
periments and measurements, qualitative and quantitative. These have demon-
strated that it is practicable to distribute power from a central plant in unlimited
amounts, with a loss not exceeding a small fraction of one per cent, in the trans-
mission, even to the greatest distance, twelve thousand miles | to the opposite
end of the globe."
Nikola Tesla
Consequently, from the above experimentally provided results from Tesla (con-
 rmed, as it seems, also by a number experiments after Tesla), the only pos-
sibility that the photons irradiated by the electric antenna are in a particular
state, very different from the standard zero-mass point-like long-range photons
that we have in the situation of the transverse electromagnetic wave when prop-
agates in the vacuum, so that the scalar wave, also composed by the photons,
does not have more observable electromagnetic properties: this can explain also
why such waves can pass through "any solid object including Faraday Cages".
Moreover, by Tesla's ideas, these longitudinal (scalar) waves propagate like
sound or plasma waves: both of these waves are composed by a high number
of corpuscular particles (or molecules for sound waves) that have the rest-mass
different from zero, differently from the stable massless point-like photons. This
means that such waves, generated by photons (from the electrical sources, i.e.,
antennas) must have the particular states of these photons, different from the
"normal" states during their propagation in vacuum with the velocity of light,
when their statistical effect generates the transverse electro-magnetic plain wave
(with the electric and magnetic  elds orthogonal to the direction of the wave
propagation, that is, the propagation of a beam of such massless photons).
The second important point is that, from the fact that the photons are inter-

mediary bosons for the electrically charged massive particles, the propagation
of a beam of such photons is governed by the Maxwell's equations: it means
that also the beam, composed by a high number of such "not normal state"
photons, must satisfy Maxwell's equations, also if the resulting electric and
magnetic  elds of such beam are equal to zero.
That is, the scalar longitudinal waves generated by a beam, composed by a
high number of these "not normal photons", must satisfy the Maxwell's equa-
tions and to transfer their energy also when the electric and magnetic  elds
of such a wave are zero and the Poynting vector (different from zero for the
ordinary transverse electromagnetic waves) is equal to zero! Such a particular
condition is in fact provided by the recent publication of the C.I.A document
CIA-RDP96-00792R000500240001-6, approved for release 2001/03/07 (about a
century after Tesla's discovery) with the subject: Scalar Waves (Ref: Verbal
Request for Summary Statement on Scalar Waves). In this document, point 2,
is written:
"There is a community in the U.S.A. that believes that the scalar waves are
realizable. In recent conference sponsored by the IEEE these where openly dis-
cussed and a proceedings on the conference exists. The conference was dedicated
to Nicola Tesla and his work, and the paper presented claimed some of Tesla's
work used scalar wave concepts".
In what follows I will use all this information in order to  nd a possible solu-
tion for the nature of these scalar Tesla's waves, without changing the Maxwell's
theory and in accordance with quantum theory and special relativity in which
the maximal possible velocity is that of light. I will also show where was the
error of Tesla to suppose that the speed of such scalar waves (and the photons
that compose such waves) is superluminal. The origin of this error is that they
apply, for the frequency   and wavelength  , with the period of oscillation T
and velocity of propagation v  c, the equation (9)
1
T
=   =
v
 
, valid only
for the standard transverse electromagnetic waves and not for the longitudinal
(scalar) waves, as it will be shown.
Moreover, we explained the statistical meaning of the electromagnetic equa-
tions. That is, the electric and magnetic  elds,
  !
E and
  !
B respectively, are the
statistical effects of the interactions of the charged (negative and positive) ele-
mentary particles with the intermediary bosons (photons) between them, which
are not electrically charged elementary particles. So, a single photon has no as-
sociated with it an own electric  eld.
We know also that if an electron in a given reference system is in rest then the
photons emitted and absorbed by this electron, which generate an electric  eld

  !
E around it, do not generate any magnetic  eld. The magnetic  eld is the sta-
tistical effect of the photons generated by this electron only for other reference
systems for which this electron moves with some speed
  !
v . Thus, the magnetic
 eld is only a relativistic phenomena in quantum physics (Special Relativity)
as, for example is the total energy and relativistic effect w.r.t. the invariant
rest-mass energy of the same massive particle. The electric  eld, differently
from the magnetic  eld, there exists in every reference system (is an 'objective'
 eld property), also for the proper frame of charged particle (where the speed
of this electrically charged particle is zero).
Just because of that,r 
  !
E is different from zero in the regions where there
exist the charged elementary particles (the electrons, for example), and is pro-
portional to the density of these charged elementary particles in a given region
of space. No one elementary particle if found whit the magnetic charge. So
there is no any density of such hypothetic magnetically-charged elementary
particles in a given space region, in order to obtain thatr 
  !
B6= 0. The only
way to avoid such a dissipation of the photons energy can be obtained when the
electric  eld of such a scalar wave is equal to zero. In this way, this scalar wave
does not interact with the electrons in the earth, similarly for the propagation
of neutrinos. However, here we have the propagation of the photons emitted
by the electromagnetic Tesla's antenna and composing these scalar waves, not
the propagation of neutrinos! Tesla did not try to modify the Maxwell's theory,
in order to explain some of his experimental results, and hence I will try to
obtain a possible interpretation of his "scalar waves" strictly inside the valid
Maxwell's theory. Hence, in the case of the Lorenz gauge potentials (25), when

where the  rst equation corresponds to the scalar longitudinal waves in plasma
with charge density  (like that obtained in the microwave traveling-wave-tubes
(TWT)).
However, we can not use these equations for the Tesla's scalar waves, because
such waves will be absorbed in the earth (in fact, for example, we have the
vacuum inside the TWT where propagates beam of electrons with longitudinal
electromagnetic waves).
In order to obtain the scalar longitudinal waves with zero electric and magnetic
 eld, which can propagate trough earth without loses, we must have a beam
of the photons which does not generate the electric and magnetic  elds, like

neutrinos which are massive particles with in nitesimal but  nite rest-mass
and able to propagate with the speed close to the speed of light. It is well
known that such massive particles propagate with very small losses through
any material and are able to pass through Faraday cages, as veri ed by Tesla.
Consequently, as in the case of the antenna's near- eld, we can consider the
massive photons as constituent parts of the Tesla's longitudinal scalar waves.
Such massive photons, with the low-frequency (low energy), would have the
small rest-mass as that of neutrinos, and hence the same propagation properties.
The only difference is that neutrino is a neutral fermion with spin
1

and  xed
invariant rest-mass, while the massive photon has no a  xed invariant rest-mass
and has the boson's spin 1.
Let us consider the longitudinal scalar wave composed by the massive long-range
photons with energy density

(t;
  !
r ), which propagates with the constant
extremely high speed
  !
c = ce

(with c less than the speed of light in the
vacuum) as a dense beam along the axes x. From the fact that the (group)
speed of these photons c corresponds to the speed of light, c is just the "speed
of light in the earth", and hence less than the speed of light in the vacuum.
Consequently, this speed of massive photonsc =

Notice that the equations above specify the 4-potential vector, for a  xed in-
stance of time t, in the 3-D regions where is presented this beam of massive
photons. The vector potential
  !
A is de ned in analog way as in (27) and is just
in the direction of the propagation of the photons (of the light), differently from
the Hertzian transversal linearly polarized waves when it is orthogonal to the
direction of the wave propagation in (14). This physical phenomena justi es
the name of 'longitudinal waves' given to these Tesla scalar waves.
In fact, for the harmonic antenna (Tesla resonance of its antenna of scalar
waves, at position x = 0 on the Earth's surface, with period T ) that produces
the scalar waves with wave-length   = cT , with k =

is the opposite point of Earth's
surface from which these massive photons reect, then we obtain the standing
wave of this scalar wave of photons inside the Earth which behaves as Tesla's
EM resonator. Note that the equation (34) corresponds to the Lorenz gauge
potentials satisfying (25), so that 4-potential satisfy the equation (31) but with

That is, we obtained that for this longitudinal scalar wave, composed by the
massive photons, the produced electric and magnetic  elds are equal to zero.
Thus, this beam does not interact with charged particles (as it does transverse
electromagnetic wave of photons) and hence it will not have the signi cant losses
during the propagation through the earth (like to the beam of neutrinos). Thus,
such scalar waves are able to explain the experimental results of Tesla's waves,
that propagate through the earth with less than some percent of losses. This
phenomena con rms the fact that 4-potential electromagnetic vector is more
fundamental natural phenomena than the derived electric and magnetic forces
  !
E and
  !
B respectively. Moreover, in this case of the Tesla's longitudinal scalar
waves, composed by the massive photons, the 4-potential electromagnetic vector
is uniquely determined from the density 
p
of the massive photons, in this way:
  From (35) we have that the vector potential
  !
A =
a
 
c
 
p
(t;q
1
)e
1
, of a dense
beam of massive photons, represents the force of the energy density of
massive photons, that is, the pressure vector of this scalar wave.
  From (35) we have that the scalar potential
 
c
=
a
 
c
 
p
(t;q
1
) represents the
scalar value of the pressure of this wave.
  Consequently, the 4-potential vector for Tesla scalar (longitudinal) waves,
is given in the following simple 4-gradient of the density of the massive
photons  
p
propagating with the speed of light in the given medium:
A

c

  !

p
(t;q

).
Thus, differently from the transverse electromagnetic linearly polarized wave,
for which scalar potential   = 0, and we have the single vector potential wave
(13) that propagates in the vacuum with the speedc of light, here we have also
the scalar potential wave, because  6= 0, which propagates with the vector
potential wave by the speedv. Consequently, from the fact that   and  in the
earth are different from that in the vacuum, this speedv can be considered the
"speedc of light in the earth", so that are satis ed the Maxwell's equations (31)
in the earth for Tesla's scalar waves. The standard transverse electromagnetic
waves, with massless long-range photons, cannot propagate through the earth,
because they have both electric and magnetic  eld different from zero and hence
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 95Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2020
such waves are absorbed by the earth. Only the Tesla scalar waves, with mas-
sive long-range photons, can propagate through the earth because their electric
and magnetic  elds are zero. The massive photons of the Tesla scalar wave
propagate like neutrinos through the earth (without signi cative losses), but
from the fact that are not fermions but massive bosons, they reect from the
surface of discontinuity between earth and air (on the opposite Earth-side w.r.t.
Tesla's antenna, so that can produce the resonance system with standing waves
inside the Earth (differently from the neutrinos) as shown by Tesla's experi-
ments.
Consequently, based on the standard electromagnetic Maxwell's theory and the
IQM theory of massive photons, the Tesla's scalar (longitudinal) waves and the
resonant system with possibility to transfer the enormous quantities of electro-
magnetic energy through the Earth (transported with the speed of light trough
the Earth by the massive photons) have a physical explanation. However, the
practical applications need some veri cations because not all massive photons
would reect from the opposite side of the Earth (it is not a perfect resonator),
and this can produce some danger collateral consequences around the region of
the reection of these massive photons.
