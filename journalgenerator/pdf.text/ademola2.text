Abstract
In this paper, the behaviour of solutions of certain second order nonlinear non-
autonomous differential equations is considered. By employing the Lyapunov's second
method, a suitable complete Lyapunov function is constructed and used to establish su -
cient conditions that guarantee existence of solutions that are periodic, uniformly asymp-
totically stable and uniformly ultimately bounded. Obtained results are not only new but
also include many outstanding recent results in the literature.
Keywords: Second order; Nonlinear differential equation; Uniform stability; Uniform
ultimate boundedness; Periodic solutions
1 Introduction
The investigation of the problems of qualitative behaviour of solutions such as
stability, boundedness, convergence, periodicity, to mention few, is an impor-
tant subject in the theory of ordinary differential equations. In this regards up
till today, Lyapunovs direct (or second) method is the most effective method
when dealing with these problems. Of course, when one applies this method,
 nding a suitable complete Lyapunov function in general is always a big chal-
lenge. The major advantage of this method is that the behaviour of solutionsDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2015
of the equation in question can be obtained without any prior knowledge of
solutions.
So far, there have been many results about the qualitative behavior of solu-
tions of nonlinear differential equations see for instance the books of Yoshizawa
[11, 12] which contain general results on the subject matters other eminent au-
thors that have contributed immensely to the study of stability, boundedness,
asymptotic behaviour, existence and uniqueness of solutions of second order
ordinary differential equations include Alaba and Ogundare [1], Grigoryan [2],
Kroopnick [3], Ogundare and Afuwape [4], Ogunadare and Okecha [5], Tun  c [6]
- [9], Yoshizawa [10] and the references cited therein.
Meanwhile, in 2011, Kroopnick [3], discussed conditions under which all
solutions of the second order differential equation
x
00
+q(t)b(x) =f(t)
are bounded on R
+
= [0;1): The results obtained are the generalizations of
the linear case.
In 2013, Grigoryan [2] established criteria for boundedness and stability for the
ordinary differential equation of the form
 
00
(t) +p(t) 
0
(t) +q(t) (t) = 0; t t
0
:
Recently in 2014, Ogundare and Afuwape [4] studied conditions which guar-
antee boundedness and stability properties of solutions of generalized Lienard
equations
x
00
+f(x)x
0
+g(x) =p(t;x;x

):
Furthermore, in [7] Tun  c discussed boundedness of solutions to the second order
ordinary differential equation
x
00
+c(t;x;x
0
) +q(t)b(x) =f(t):
Finally, Alaba and Ogundare [1] gave conditions for asymptotic behaviour of
solutions of certain second order non-autonomous nonlinear ordinary differential
equation
x

+a(t)f(x;x

)x

+b(t)g(x) =p(t;x;x

):
Most of these works were done by constructing suitably Lyapunov functions
except in [3] where the integral test was used.
However, the problem of stability, boundedness and existence of periodic
solutions of second order nonlinear non-autonomous ordinary differential equa-

of solutions of second order ordinary differential equation were proved.

De nition 6 [12] The zero solution X(t)  0 of Eq. (2.1) is uniformly stable,
if the   in De nition 5 is independent of t

The following lemmas are very important in the proofs of our results.

on R

Then the trivial solution X(t)  0 of Eq. (2.1) is uniformly asymptotically
stable.
Lemma 2 [10, 11] Suppose that there exists a Lyapunov function V (t;X) de-
 ned on R
+
;kXk  R; where R may be large, which satis es the following
conditions:
(i) a(kXk)   V (t;X)   b(kXk); where a(r) and b(r) are continuous and
increasing and a(r)!1 as r!1;
(ii) V

(2.1)
(t;X)  c(kXk); where c(r) is positive and continuous,
then solutions of Eq. (2.1) are uniformly ultimately bounded.
Lemma 3 [10, 11] If there exists a Lyapunov function satisfying the condition
of Lemma 2, then Eq. (2.1) has at least a periodic solution of period !:

consider the case when p(t;x;x

respectively where the functions  ;g;h and ' are de ned in Section 1. Let
(x(t);y(t)) be any solution of (3.2), the continuously differentiable function

(iii) Whenever  (x) = 1 = '(t); g( ) = f(x); h(x) = g(x) and p( ) = 0 (3.2)

(x) = 0; g( ) =a(t)f(x;y) and p( ) = 0 (3.2) reduces to
the second order non autonomous differential equation studied in [1].
(v) Thus, the result of Theorem 1 includes and extends the stability results
discussed in [1, 2] and [4].
Next, we shall state and prove a result that would be useful in the proof of
Theorem 1 and the preceding results.

Proof 1 (Proof) Let (x(t);y(t)) be any solution of (3.2), if x(t) = 0 = y(t),
it follows from (3.3) that
V (t; 0; 0) = 0: (3.6)
From the hypotheses of Theorem 1 we have '(t) '
0
for all t  0;  (x)  
0
for all x; h(x)  bx; x6= 0 and g( )  a for all t  0;x and y so that the

From the inequality (3.7), we observed thatV (t;x;y) = 0 if and only ifx

0 and V (t;x;y)> 0 if and only if x

V (t;x;y)! +1 as x

Moreover, applying the upper estimates, de ned in Theorem 1, for each of the
functions '(t);  (x); h(x) and g( ); (3.3) yields

Hence, from estimates (3.7) and (3.9) the inequality (3.4) is established with

respectively.
Next, we shall establish the inequality (3.5). To see this, let (x(t);y(t)) be

From the inequality (3.13) estimate (3.5) is established with

respec-
tively. This completes the proof of Lemma 4.
Proof 2 (Proof of Theorem 1) Let (x(t);y(t)) be any solution of system of
 rst order Eq. (3.2). From Eq. (3.6), the inequalities (3.7), (3.9) and (3.13) all
hypotheses of Lemma 1 hold hence, by Lemma 1 the trivial solution X(t)  0
of (3.2) is uniformly asymptotically stable where X = (x;y)2R
2
:
Next, if p( )6= 0 in Eq. (1.1) (in particular Eq. (1.2)) we have the following
result.
Theorem 2 In addition to the assumptions of Theorem 1, suppose that
jp( )j M; 0<M <1; (3.14)
then the solutions of (1.2) are uniformly ultimately bounded.
Remark 2 (i) If  (x) = 1; g( ) =f(x) and '(t) = 1: Equation (1.1) reduces
to that discussed in [4].
(ii) Whenever  (x) = 1; x
0
(t) = 1 and p( ) = f(t); (1.1) specializes to that
studied in [7].
(iii) When  (x) = 1 and g( ) = a(t)f(x;x
0
); then (1.1) reduces to the second
order non-autonomous non linear ordinary differential equation discussed
in [1].
(iv) The boundedness result presented in Theorem 2 includes and extends the
results in [1], [4] and [7].

Proof 3 (Proof of Theorem 2) Let (x(t);y(t)) be any solution of Eq. (1.2).
The Lyapunov's function de ned in Eq. (3.3) gives rise to the inequalities (3.7),
(3.9) and the expression in (3.8) hold for Eq. (1.2). Furthermore, the derivative
of the function V de ned by Eq. (3.3) with respect to the independent variable
t along the solution path of Eq. (1.2) is

Now by estimate (3.14) and noting the fact that (jxj +jyj)

follows from the inequality (3.16) that

may be large. Now from the inequalities
(3.7), (3.9) and (3.17) the hypotheses of Lemma 2 hold. Hence, by Lemma 2
the solutions of Eq. (1.2) are uniformly ultimately bounded.
Next, we shall state and prove a result on the periodic solutions of the system
of Eq. (1.2).
Theorem 3 If all the assumptions of Theorem 2 hold, then Eq. (1.2) has at
least a periodic solution of period !:
Proof 4 (Proof) Let (x(t);y(t)) be any solution of Eq. (1.2). Since the Lya-
punov's function de ned in (3.3) satis es the assumptions of Theorem 2, which
in turn satisfy the assumptions of Lemma 2. Thus by Lemma 2 and Lemma 3
equation (1.2) has at least a periodic solution of period !: This completes the
proof of Theorem 3.

Finally, if the forcing termp( ) is replaced with the functionp(t);p2C[R

in Eq. (1.1) we have

We have the following result.

Proof 5 (Proof) Let (x(t);y(t)) be any solution of Eq.(3.19). In view of the
Lyapunov's function de ned in Eq. (3.3), estimate (3.7) holds for Eq. (3.19).
The derivative of the function V with respect to t along the solution path of Eq.
