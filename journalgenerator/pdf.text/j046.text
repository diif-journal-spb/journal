Abstract
The unsteady convective ﬂow of a viscous, heat conducting ﬂuid near an
inﬁnite vertical plate has been considered in a system rotating with a constant
angular velocity. The governing partial differential equations have been solved
exactly for the special case of Prandtl number equal to unity. Analytical ex-

effects of rotation on the boundary layer ﬂow and the skin friction have been
discussed using the exact solution.
1 Introduction
Fluid convection at vertical plates resulting from buoyancy forces ﬁnds applica-
tions in several industrial and technological ﬁelds such as nuclear reactors, heat
exchangers, electroniccoolingequipmentsandcrystalgrowth, amongothers. It
isalsoknownthatconvectionﬂowsaregreatlyinﬂuencedbyrotation. However,
the interaction between rotation and buoyancy forces are so complex that true
predictionsofthedynamicalfeaturesoftheﬂuidﬂowarepossibleonlyforsome
idealized models. The convective ﬂow problems are mostly non-linear, and are
described by (systems of) non-linear partial differential equations. These equa-
tions with the corresponding initial and boundary conditions are usually solved
by numerical methods. On the other hand, linear problems are sometimes
amenable to exact analytical treatments as occurs, for instance, in ﬂow past
ﬂat plates [1 – 4]. The degree of complexity of the solution procedure will still
bedictatedbythenatureoftheinitialandboundaryconditionsoftheproblem.
Recently, Ker and Lin [5] carried out convection studies in a differentially
heated rotating cubic cavity and obtained numerical solutions of the governing
equations. They also did experimental investigations of the same problem and
used the experimental data for verifying the numerical solutions. Our aim
in this paper is to obtain an exact solution for a special case of their work
when a ﬂuid of Prandtl number equal to unity is bounded on only one side
by a rotating inﬁnite vertical plate and when the rotational buoyancy force is
neglected. The relevant equations governing the motion are given in Section
2. It has been shown that an exact solution for the resulting initial-boundary-
value problem can be obtained using the method of Laplace transforms. The
usefulness of Laplace transforms in ﬁnding exact solutions of ﬂuid dynamical
problems is well-known [1, 4, 6, 7]. In the same vein, we have presented in
Section 3 analytical solutions for the boundary layer ﬂow variables for ﬂuids of
Prandtl number equal to unity. Some numerical results showing the inﬂuence
of rotation on the boundary layer ﬂow and on the stress at the plate have been
presented in Section 4.

2 Governing Equations
Thephysicalsituationconsistsoftheunsteadyﬂowofanincompressibleviscous
ﬂuidnearaninﬁniteverticalplaterotatinginitsownplane. Withrespecttoan
arbitrary origin O on this planar wall, the axes Ox
0
and Oy
0
are ﬁxed on it in
mutually perpendicular directions. The axis Oz
0
is taken perpendicular to the
plate into the ﬂuid. Initially, the plate and the ﬂuid are at rest and at the same
temperature T

. Subsequently (t
0
> 0), the plate starts rotating in its own
plane with a constant angular velocity Ω

, and the plate temperature is raised
toT

w
. The ﬂuid ﬂow near the plate thus is driven by the Coriolis force and the
thermal buoyancy. Under this physical situation, the ﬁeld quantities will be
functions of the space coordinate z

only. The governing equations
of the resulting unsteady ﬂow subject to rotation and under the Boussinesq

In the following, we shall obtain the exact solution of the problem for the
special case of ﬂuids whose Prandtl number P = 1. This corresponds to those
ﬂuids whose velocity and thermal boundary layer thicknesses are of the same
order of magnitude. There are several ﬂuids of practical interest that belong to
this category.

3 Method of Solution
As stated in Section 1, we shall use the method of Laplace transforms to ﬁnd
the exact solutions of eqs (8) and (11) describing the unsteady ﬂow subject to
rotation. Writing

Equations (19) and (20) are exact solutions. As these have been obtained
formally by Laplace transforms, it may be desirable and interesting to verify
the solutions. Since erfc(0) = 1, and erfc(∞) = 0, it can be easily veriﬁed
that the initial and boundary conditions are satisﬁed byT(z,t) andq(z,t). The
veriﬁcation of T(z,t) given by eq(19) as the solution of eq(8) (with P = 3D1)
is straightforward, and is not done here. We shall, however, show that eq(20)
representstheexactsolutionofeq(11). Tothisend,weobservethattherelevant
partial derivatives of q(z,t) can be written in the forms

Using eq(22) in eq(11), and noting that q

that eq(11) is identically satisﬁed.
It is of practical importance to analyze the effect of rotation on the st ress
at the boundary. This can be done by evaluating the skin friction co mponents.
Using the complex velocity function given by eq(20), the compon ents of skin

Velocity and Skin Friction Components
The expressions for q(z,t) and the skin friction given by eq(20) and eq(23),
respectively, are complex functions, and therefore require these to be sepa-
rated into real and imaginary parts so as to yield analytical expressions for the
primary and secondary velocity distributions and the respective skin friction
components. For this we write [10]
erfc(x+iy) =f(x,y)+ih(x,y) (24)

4 Numerical Results
The numerical values of the primary and secondary velocities u and v, re-
spectively, have been presented in Table 1. Table 1a shows the effect of the
parameter Ω when t = 0.1 while Table 1b shows the temporal variations for
Ω = 0.5. It may be noted that Ω is a measure of the relative inﬂuence of the
rotation and thermal buoyancy. For relatively small values of Ω, the primary
velocity u increases to a maximum near the boundary and then decreases to
zero. Within this range of values of Ω, the secondary velocity v decreases to
a minimum and then approaches its stationary value. However, it was seen
during our computations that for much higher values of Ω, which correspond to
thedominanceofCoriolisforceoverthermalbuoyancy,thevelocitycomponents
undergo oscillations in the boundary layer. Similar oscillations of velocity have
also been noted in the rotating cavity ﬂow considered in [5]. In the present
unsteady problem, the oscillatory ﬂow was evident even for small values of Ω
when t is large. We also note that u increases with t, and v decreases with it.
