Abstract
In the ¯eld of holomorphic dynamics in one complex variable, the `hedge-
hog' is the local and invariant set arising around irrationally indifferent ¯xed
point with a small or empty local linearization domain. Endowed with a very
complicate shape, its existence depends upon weak numerical conditions and
the problem of its digital visualization is open. We give an approach enjoying a
far-reaching insight and crunching the long computation times, as required by
other graphical methods.

Since Arthur Cayley's works in 1879{80 on the Newton-Raphson iterative
method [7, 8, 9], together with SchrÄ oder's [27, 28] and Koenigs' seminal results
[14, 15, 16], it was clear that the fate of forward orbits is susceptible to changes

We will focus on the holomorphic dynamics in one complex variable (v =

surfaces (dim 2). Again, they could include ¯nitely and of in¯nitely many
points (dim 0); or be a continuum (dim 1 and 2). The union of invariants
with the same properties is the invariant set. The goal of holomorphic dy-
namics is to understand the structure and role of such invariant sets by the
algebraic, topological, geometrical and, in some particular cases, from the nu-
merical viewpoint too. And coming along that way, some advanced questions
arise to high degrees of complication, even deserving a multilateral attack via

C, discovered during early XXth century, de¯ned
the two complementary sets of the `basins B of attraction' and of `Julia set' J.
Each basinB is the maximal set of seeds whose forward orbits converge to the
same neighborhood N of non-repelling ¯xed point. Most often, N includes a
limit cycle of ¯nitely many points; with regard to all local cases, non-repelling
¯xed points do not necessarily match with the concept of limit cycle in general.
On the other hand, J could be totally disconnected and including in¯nitely
many points, or a continuous line (Jordan or including double points); ¯nally,
it could be two-dimensional (J ´C
1
). J is the complement of the union of all
basins, F ´[B, and it is also the boundary of F: so J ´ @F and J ´

CnF.
This union is also termed `Fatou set' in honor of Pierre Fatou (1878{1929),
who co-pioneered these early global researches in the same times (1918{20)
and independently from Gaston Julia (1893{1978), credited as the ¯rst o±cial

of the sets J in 1917{18.
Julia sets are well-known objects at all levels today, sparkling the imagina-
tion a wide range of people, from mathematicians to artists and to the curious.
Their suggestive, very complicated fractal shapes were disclosed to human eyes
through early computer experiments during late 1970s: machines accuracy,
speed and screen resolutions became indispensable for unveiling the graphical
details of their very complicate topologies, hardly reproducible via the hand-
made and rough drawings available to ancient mathematicians. For the eye,
at least, not for the mind. The topological features were already clear to Fa-
tou and Julia; although the Technology run is continuously reaching to ¯ner
and ¯ner results and shorter computation times, this progress is not meant
as a relevant leg along the whole road-map of holomorphic dynamics: speed
and numerical accuracy are comfortable tools but they represent the `brutal
force' side of the deal and thus cannot turn mathematicians' eyes away from
the development of methods deepening the analytical and geometrical laws de-
termining our invariants. Machines are just means. The graphical methods
may however rise to some nobility if developed along the `intelligent' direction:
algorithmically speaking, they are as e±cient as the ¯ne display is achieved by
¯tting the dynamical features of the given local invariants, not exploiting full
machine performances. This especially holds true for local invariants, where
speci¯c methods are more often required. The textbooks [2, 6, 19] are good
entry points to deepen these introductory concepts in mathematical terms.

hog' de¯nition, the second will go over most available techniques, shown to fail

the support of pseudo-C++ code. We will begin to revisit a number of basic
concepts in this ¯eld now; despite of their triviality, they will drive the reader
along the further considerations which allowed to solve this practical problem.
2 Basic theory
2.1 The four cases
This is a sketch of the mathematics behind our local environment, where com-
plex dynamics focus on the orbits behavior induced by the iterates f

neighborhoods of limit cycles for the function f(z). For an easier approach,
we will assume that invariants are just ¯xed points ± = f(±), but all next
concepts extend to cycles of higher orders after minor modi¯cations. Further
observations will take on complex numbers in the Euler form: z´ re
2¼iµ
. One
initial di±culty is that they do not satisfy the Trichotomy law. But a classi-
¯cation necessarily wants them to be ordered under one real parameter. As
previously mentioned, the linear part of z

(z) is an algebraic local in-
variant for any iterate of rank n. The question is then enlightened as one

in the Euler form. This achieves the sought order, regardless of the argument,
as we ¯nd the 4 main classes of local dynamics around the ¯xed points:
1. super-attracting, whenj¸j=0;
2. attracting, when 0<j¸j<1;
3. indifferent or neutral, whenj¸j=1=je
2¼iµ
j;
4. repelling, whenj¸j>0.
2.2 Inclusion and exclusion
The terms in italics, for 1, 2 and 4, refer to the dynamical trend (towards or
outgoingfromthe¯xedpoint/periodiccycle);onlytheentry3escapesfromthis
wording convention: dynamics are not uniquely determined here. This basic
classi¯cation splits into two extremal cases: (super{)attracting and repelling
dynamics, similar except for their opposite directions.
Standing in the middle, indifferent points play as a sort of conjunction be-
tweenattractionandrepulsion, inaccordancetoadual(un{)relation: inclusive
(the union of the opposites) when both attracting and repelling dynamics play
aroundthe¯xedpoint. Or exclusive (theabsenceofopposites)whennoattrac-
tion and repulsion applies. In global terms, one sees that (super{)attracting
cycles are approached by forward iterates f
n
(z);n > 0 and that Julia sets, in-
cluding all repelling cycles, are accessible by backward iterates f
n
(z);n < 0.
Thus both successions of iterates run along a same road { the orbit { in one
sense or in the other, from cycles of ¯nite order to cycles of in¯nite order or
viceversa. The indifferent type breaks up this trend, intimating to carefully
revisit the `limit' concept, for example, to accomplish its comprehension.

be parameterized in the argument 0 · µ < 1;µ 2 R. Analogously to the
previous expedient, we move to an exponential space this time, determined by
the real variable µ. First we differ 2 fundamental cases: when µ2Q (rationally
indifferent ±, parabolic case) or µ 2 RnQ (irrationally indifferent ±, elliptic
case). The former geometrically relates to one only invariant set, the Fatou-
Leau°ower(seedef. atp. 81). Whileµ2RnQbranchesouttoarichervariety:

the geometrical description via one among three elementary motions in the
plane: attraction (0 · j¸j < 1), dilation (j¸j > 1) and rotation (j¸j = 1), all
represented by the linear map ¸z. This is not absolutely right nor completely
wrong: in the dynamical terms of a whole family of iterates, one needs to prove
whether the recursive process itself could enjoy the same possibility as it al-
ways does for one function f(z) at once, i.e. whether f
n
(z) can locally turn
into ¸z or not. In this reconsidered form, that initial guess was close to what
pushed SchrÄ oder and, later, Koenigs to show that most holomorphic dynamics
canbelocallyturnedinto¸z. Tothisend, thecrucialtoolbecametheso-called
SchrÄ oder functional equation (SFE), here in the general formula:
Ã[f(z)]=a[Ã(z)]; (2.1)
where Ã(z) is an invertible map allowing f(z) to be representable locally by
a(z). The goal of (2.2) is to set up an analogy between the local behavior of

iterates f
n
(z) around ± and an easier model. Without loss of generalization,
let the origin be ¯xed for f(z). SchrÄ oder and Koenigs succeeded to prove the
analogy, strengthening the connection between SFE and holomorphic dynamics
when they showed that a(z) can be replaced with ¸ ´ f

As a counterpart to the previous easier cases, the discussion level is upset
around neutral points (see list at p. 54): a much more delicate analysis, com-
paratively to the di±culties of the different situations for this case, is required.

. Resuming
the core of studies from 1890s to 1940s, it was acknowledged that (2.4) never
commutes for µ 2 Q whereas the numerical nature of µ 2 RnQ had to be
elucidated for a de¯nite response in this sense. After the ¯rst controversial
results, Cremer (1920{30s) opened the road to a clearer perspective and Siegel
¯nally (1942) closed such long period of doubt as he showed that the irrational
µ shall satisfy this Diophantine condition

for every rational number p=q where p;q 2 N. Then iterates f

to be linearizable into a complex rigid rotation or just `linearizable' for short
6
;
topologically speaking, there exists a neighborhood of ± which is conformally
isomorphic to a rotatory disc by f
n
(z), theSiegel disc. When (2.5) holds, µ is
poorly approximated by rational numbers; otherwise it is goodly approximated
and no such linearization applies. It is clear that rational arguments (parabolic
sub-case, µ2Q) are not Diophantine and cannot satisfy (2.5): this also holds
forasubclassofirrationals{theLiouville numbers. Now SFEisnolongeruseful
and therefore one summarizes the previous concepts as follows:
² if SFE commutes around a (super{)attracting, or indifferent or a repelling
¯xed point, the local dynamics are classi¯ed by just one among these 3 elemen-
tary motions: contraction, rotation, or repulsion respectively;
² it also turns out that, when SFE fails to commute, local dynamics no
longer consist of one elementary motion: there exist local vector ¯elds, Fatou-
Leau°owersorHedgehogs,beingcompositionsofmorethanoneelementary
motion. Thus one may state that the SFE may shut the door to the local lin-
earization of iterates at a ¯xed point.

Most results are subjected to this hypothesis. For germs of higher degrees, results are susceptible to
modi¯cations.

What happens if this condition is no longer met by µ 2 RnQ? Recent
Mathematics has been stressing that the concept of `Natura non facit saltus'

rules in dynamical systems. Related works ([10, 22, 29, 30], to quote a few)
also showed that irrationals µ can gradually drop off the diophantine condition
(2.5) and the Siegel disc S slowly turns into the hedgehog H. For the above
reason, we cannot expect drastic changes in the local geometry: in fact, the
maximal S squeezes into a smaller disc, together with a complication of the
neighboring orbits at @S while, at a semi-local level, the Julia set is wedging
the surrounding basin B of attraction; when S is not maximal, H has a small
linearization area. There are even irrational arguments µ so that S contracts
¯nally to the ¯xed point ±: hereH has no linearization area and ± is no more
a center, but it is termed as a Cremer point

² let ³ 2 N be arguments whose value is a Liouville number. N is a
null-measure set.
In the course of his proof on the existence of non-centers for rational maps
([11], p. 157), Cremer also showed that the existence of cycles of growing

Becauseofthenumberofnon{repellingcyclesis¯nite(accordingtoKoenigs'

must be repelling
10
so that, roughly speaking, their accumulation shows that,
as n grows, J keeps on wedging (see ¯gs. 2.4 and 5.10 ) the bounded basin
of attraction [10]: if limsupn =1, then ± 2 J, otherwise the wedging action
of J stops at a certain distance from ± for limsupn = K < +1. (Again, the

Julia set wedges B.) The above limit may even tell that, algebraically, there

or to another basin. This situation
11
also applies when 0 is reached in (2.8) so
that ±2J: it occurs when ff is rational or it is a Liouville number. Hence the
poorly rational approximation | the diophantine condition for µ | implies a
non-empty linearization area around ±, because cycles do not accumulate at it.

The continuity may inspire a suggestive, ideal journey as we associate the
topologies of different invariant sets from (A) to (D) to the numerical con-
ditions met by µ as it goes fromRnQ toQ. The Siegel discS squeezes (¯g. 2.3

are`hedgehogs'H,whenS isnotmaximalorhasemptyinterior. Imaginingthis
journey is possible in virtue of the strong unifying power offered by hedgehogs
theory, which can link together apparently far dynamical con¯gurations. The
mathematical de¯nition of the hedgehogH is [22]:

around H. Thanks to the results by P¶ erez-Marco in 1990 (resumed in [19], p.
123) one knows thatH may show up in these different three characterizations:
1. hedgehogsH are locally linearizable and with no small cycles;
2. hedgehogsH are not locally linearizable and with small cycles;
3. hedgehogsH are not locally linearizable and without small cycles;
The `small cycles' property refers to the possible existence of in¯nitely many
cyclic orbits in a su±ciently small neighborhood of the irrationally indifferent
±. It is said that `± has the small cycle property' or `is approximated by small
cycles'. Other results on small cycles are included in [29, 30]. But this goes
too far, beyond the scope of this introduction to hedgehogs, mostly intended to
acknowledge the reader about the question on their digital visualization.

of iterates between distant neighborhoods of the ¯xed point ±. The shading

the human eye.
3.3 Convergence criteria
The fate of iterated orbits is tested at each f

, for preventing in¯nite
looping. This is commonly achieved by a trapping disc D of given radius r,
when jz
n
j < r is tested. This approach, aiming to understand when (in terms
of the value of the iterative index i) orbits might escapeD, is commonly known
as `escape time' algorithm. Some pseudo-code follows:
#include "complex.h" // this is a class handling complex numbers
// downloadable from author's site
complex z, next_z ;
complex c(0, -1); // this is the complex parameter z = 0.0 - 1.0i
t = 50 ; // top iteration index to prevent infinite looping
r = 2.0 ; // the radius of the trapping disc
for( int i = 0; i < t ; i++ )
{
next_z = z * z + c ; // we assumed the quadratic iterator
if ( abs( next_z ) > r ) break;
z = next_z ;

3.4 Obsolescence with local invariant sets
Our goal now is to discuss ways for bypassing or even lessening the two issues
in sections 3.2 and 3.3. Anyway we remark that a new idea is most wanted and
that as best as one can improve these methods, they will be however insu±-
cient to obtain a ¯ne drawing of what we seek. A ¯rst minor issue, discussed
in section 3.2, refers to colors: gradients sequences are un¯tting, so might a
randomly generated palette help otherwise? In ¯gures 3.5 , we iterated the
neighborhoods around ¯xed points of different nature and painted them by the
random palette. In ¯gs. 3.5 /A and B, we consider the squaring map f(z):z

Onenoticesthatbothsequentialandrandompalettesdowork¯nelywheniter-
ated domains shrink to the attracting ¯xed point(s) step by step (analogously
for the neighborhood of a repelling point). In ¯gs. 3.6 and 3.7 , we tried to

More than the shading gradient approach, the attracting dynamics are evident here from the nested
discs shrinking up to points.
draw the invariant sets (refer to ¯g. 2.3 ) arising around indifferent points ±,
with emphasis to colors sequence and numerical accuracy.
For example, the iteration of the rationally indifferent germ f(z) : z +z
4
retrieves a Fatou{Leau's °ower with 3 petals intersecting at the origin. Either
applying random palettes or as in¯nitesimal values of ² are set into inequality
(3.1), one cannot evince the local dynamics, but only the basins shape. And no
bene¯tsaredrawnfromtheexperimentswiththeirrationallyindifferentpoints.
In ¯g. 3.7 /A and B, the random palette and a very high number of iterates
were respectively tested to work with a Siegel disc case (it should appear in
the green basin). We tried to draw an hedgehog in (C, D). In particular, either
(B) and (D) are displayed by another coloring method (said `domain coloring')
which sets a one-to-one map between each complex point on the ¯nite plane
and the RGB cube, associating to one and only one color. Even if the iterative
index i increases to very huge values, orbits cannot get very close to ±, so that
no ¯ner pictures can be obtained.

Figures 3.6 and 3.7 attest that these methods, as well as any sort of
variation, are unable to attain these local invariant sets as required, most im-
portant, in reasonable times. The main issue is that these methods feel a lot
the convergence rate decrease at indifferent points.

4 Off to `composite dynamics'
Theauthorwasintroducedtotheproblemofdrawinghedgehogsonacomputer
byprofessorP¶ erez-MarcoduringaninformalmeetingatPerugia(Italy)onsum-
mer 2002 and fully reconsidered during Spring 2006. Milnor, in the appendix
H of [19] (p. 244), also pointed out to the open question of retrieving ¯ne pic-
tures of local dynamics around non{linearizable indifferent pointsin reasonable
times, with emphasis to the irrational kind: | `For the ¯xed points of Cremer
type, the situation is much worse. As far as I know, no useful computer picture
of such a point has ever been produced!'.
4.1 The core question
What should the drawing of a local invariant set focus on?
Without relying on a good response to this question, it might not make
so much sense to continue. As remarked in table 2.2 at p. 57, holomorphic
dynamics have different invariant sets. Globally speaking, Julia sets J are easy
to display: one has just to tune the accuracy magnitude or set the top iterates
index, according to the method applied as well as one ¯ne palette.
In local terms, the neighboring dynamics at J points are collected under
one concept: as orbits run across the basins B of attraction, their character,
initiallyrepellingnearJ,continuouslychangeswhilereachingtheneighborhood
of a non{repelling cycle (here, one ¯xed point ±). But some local invariant sets
I
s
around ± enjoy more or less complicated dynamics. The table 2.2 also
offers an overview of invariant sets endowed with `composite dynamics', that is,
involving more than one elementary motion. In geometrical terms, composite
dynamicsretrievemorethanoneinformationpieceatoneiterate,andthusthey
represent, even by a mere quantitatively viewpoint, an harder situation than
those local dynamics involving one only elementary motion. One also remarks
that the convergence speeds of neighboring orbits around the indifferent ± gets

slower as iterates get closer to ±; in the linear case of Siegel discs, convergence
rate even stops to decrease as the modulus of iterates jz

(z)j arrests
at one strictly positive value. These are symptomatic reasons of obsolescence,
becausethepreviousmethodsessentiallyworkonchromaticrepresentationsfor
dynamics of attracting kind or, at the largest extent, of linear kind. Hence we
conclude that the SFE shall be dropped off as well as the previous graphical
methods: a new basis is required.
As we get back to non-linearizable local dynamics at I
s
, we shall consider
that the previous mathematical discussion was helpful to have now some ideas
of how dynamics are working around a Cremer point and thus of a glimmer of
the sets topology around there somehow. After we caught an idea of the shape,
we shall close the circle by rendering the true shape to such ideas. One then
wants(1)todrawtheboundary@I
s
(graphically,theshape)andpossibly(2)the
motions therein (the orbits behavior). The accomplishment of (2) suggested us
tofocusonsideconsiderationsabouttheelementarypsychologyofSpace,which
is the perception of motion `as lines in the principal directions of curvature,
which may communicate surface shape better than lines in other directions'
([12], p. 43). This is a common feature of the ¯eld of Non-Photorealistic
Rendering (NPR), associated to the concept of `perceptually e±cient images',
meaning to the visual representation which emphasizes the important features
and minimizes the super°uous details! This is a convenient concept to be
regardedforourpurposesandpushestoseekananalogouslyshapedgeometrical
model of the invariant set and being capable to evince both (1) and (2).
4.2 Obstructions (I) : no ticket for the ideal journey
Drawinglocalinvariantsetsaroundirrationallynon-linearizableindifferentpoints
mainly relates to the degeneration of the irrational argument µ 2RnQ into a
rational ff2Q, owing to ¯nite digits machine computation. When µ is already
rational, the question boils down to the convergence speed. We cannot want
to attain the hedgehog on the wings of iterates exclusively, because we will
approach to something differing from what we started looking for. Anyway we
cannot quit to work with iterates at all! The strategy is then to alleviate the
error rounding off. Throughout the following pages, in conclusion of some con-
siderations on lacks and issues of several methods to display complex dynamics
on a computer, we will show how this problem was algorithmically cracked for
both the above numerical types.

Let the formula (2.7). One major issue is to check whether ³ = µ
n
could
approximate irrationals poorly or not. One would like to distinguish the formal
value µ with the input value ff in practice, where ff¼ µ: thenjff¡µj = " > 0.
Analogously the iteration process may retrieve jff
n
¡µ
n
j = ½ > " > 0, with
the growth of error magnitude. Then we cannot get contented of µ: could we
make ½ tend to 0, if possible? More subtle issues may come up. In addition
to numerical di±culties, even Topology grants no way out: Cremer's partition
of irrational numbers shows that values µ 2 N cannot be picked up easily by
a machine, in order to guarantee the chosen invariant set. The existence of
hedgehogsH depends upon numerical conditions which are extremely weak for
themachinedecimalscut-off,thatis,heredynamicsfeelalottheapproximation
and their rendering cannot be pursued through methods relying on numerical
computationsexclusively. Again: would it make sense to approximate a number
ff
n
2RnQ via another irrational µ
n
which possibly enjoys different numerical
properties? The value ff
n
might give rise to another local invariant set which
differs, more or less evidently, from the one associated to µ
n
. Cremer [11]
observed that the null Lebesgue measure property does not imply that the set
N istotallydisconnected(pointwise); onthecontrary,itmayconsistofdisjoint
intervals with positive, in¯nitesimal length " > 0. If machine approximation
could work under at a certain magnitude % < ", we could afford to be more
optimistic, in a way or another, of reaching a su±ciently sharp approximation
for the original value ff
n
and of ¯nding the related invariant set with adequate
accuracy. At the same cost of long time computations anyway: whatever fast
a computer might be then { times would not be decisively shortened because
the whole process, in its intrinsic nature, lacks of e±ciency (see the end of
introduction). Thus the numerical attack path is obstructed. At this point
(!), Topology could be the only way out: having clear in mind that the digital
representationwouldjustofferanapproximationofwhatnon{linearizablelocal
dynamics really are in the continuum, is there an alternative attack possibly
approximating such kind of properties?
Runningbackintotheapproximationconcept, werecallitreferstoanother
entity ¯ imitating, with a tolerable error, the original ff. Hence we questioned
on whether it is plausible to ¯nd out another, closer, value ¯ and so that
jff¡¯j<jff¡µj
holds? From the above, it seems that, if ¯;µ belong to a segment centered at
ff and whose width is · ", then the approximation would make some sense.
Otherwise, trying an approximation would throw us into a process generating

sequences of in¯nitely many values »;°;:::;¿ and this endless chain of nested
inequalities

? In fact, the chain nests as follows:

:
These speculations, together with the topological classi¯cation of hedgehogs
at the end of section 2.5 { where small cycles may occur or not and which
depend on such propertiesP of different nature, could give rise to the following
questions:
Question 4.1 Do we already know all numerical properties so that we can safely
state to already know any hedgehog con¯guration? Can we ¯nd other numerical
properties relating to new and unknown behavior of orbits inside hedgehogs?
Thus, is their number ¯nite? And, if so, how many are they?
More generally one discusses on the possibility of moving from one property to
another and, in our context of hedgehogs theory, the crucial question is:
Question 4.2 Is there a way to move from one Liouville number to a Diophantine
irrational value so that the ideal journey may come true ?
These are questions we are not able to give a response; they arose during the
inventing of our graphical approach.
4.3 Obstructions (II): practice really matters
Nowwithregardtothepracticalcomputationsinvolvedintheiterationprocess,
we can ¯nd 3 obstructions to to hedgehogs, as drawn via ordinary methods:
1. Statistical: due to theM;N sets distribution over the real interval [0;1],
it much easier to pick up a value µ 2 M than one ³ 2 N. And due to
above approximation, this task gets harder than ever.
2. Numerical: numbers µ 2 M do not feel the approximation as much as
³ 2 N; in fact, under iterates, Liouville numbers ³ tend to be turned
into new values which are Diophantine irrationals; new resulting values
cannot goodly approximate rational numbers and then one falls back into
the Siegel disc case.

(A) (B) (C) (D)
Figure 4.8 : I am the star. The (holed) n
th
-branched star in monochromatic and colored versions.
3. Procedural: Liouville's condition is fundamental to draw hedgehogs, but it
is also weakly preserved under iteration. The orbits speed inside H slows
down to the ¯xed ±. The remedy to get ¯ner results is to let the iteration
index n explode and we get back to obstructions 1 and 2.
No way out to overcome the two obstructions of approximation and com-
puter usage. Hence, not having a valid solution at hand nor being successful
to ¯nd it, the problem was left open until we occasionally came to it during
March 2006, when we planned to ¯nd a strategy for lessening the irrationality
wipeout. In the next section, the analysis on ordinary graphical methods for
holomorphic dynamics will bring to their exclusion from the run for accurate
displays of local invariant sets and, mostly, of hedgehogs.
4.4 Quality vs. quantity
Again, we also adduce that the methods described in section 3 are even struc-
turally weak for our purposes: in fact, they have been developed (read, cus-
tomized) for iterates of polynomial maps, in primis the quadratic f(z):z
2
+c,
where z;c 2C and c is a parameter. As we showed before, methods
16
might
not work ¯nely or at all when exported to dynamical systems being different
from their original context. The ones we illustrated do work quantitatively and
fail with dynamics claiming very sharp numerical accuracy; that is, the result-
ing geometry of invariant sets (both in local and global terms) is exclusively
retrieved by the value of the last iterated point z
m
, where m is the largest it-
erative index available to the machine architecture, at the higher costs of long
computation times.
16
This also happened to for quaternionic Julia sets, where the author revisited the analogous escape time
method so to display even those Julia sets which are not closed and bounded curves, but extend to point at
in¯nity [24, 25] (one example is the Newton-Raphson method applied to the cubic h
3
¡1 = 0;h2H, whereH
is the quaternion space).

Figure 4.9 : Trying some linear equipotential models. These are equipotential renderings
based upon the linear models of concentric disks (A), vertical (B) and horizontal bands (C). All fail
to evince the hedgehog shape.
Saving time and resources, improving speed and accuracy are goals of Au-
tomatics: even at the cost of indirect attack (a sort of cheat, then!), we found
a way out as we opted to not approach the neighborhoods, but to `be-already-
there-and-work-with-orbits'. This new direction cannot avoid the method cus-
tomization: we adopted an half-way strategy which, besides the inevitable ¯-
nite digits computation, teams up with a qualitative attack by the imitation
of a model with pre-de¯ned shape. More explicitly, all this came after the con-
clusions in section 2.3, where the failure of SFE for Fatou-Leau °owers and
hedgehogs implied that such dynamics cannot be adequately described by linear
models based upon regular curves, such as concentric circles (isomorphic under
rotations) or straight-lines bands (see ¯gs. 4.9 ). So we liked to use a non{
regular and (mostly) topologically equivalent non{linear model. Namely it is
the (holed) n
th
-branched star, whose versions have been depicted in table 4.8 .
Itisextremelyimportanttoremarkthatthefollowingresultsusethequadratic
germ (2.6) exclusively: the theory on irrationally ¯xed points came to the to-
day robust status for this degree only by now; an attack to the iterates of such
holomorphic germs of higher degrees is documented in [31].
5 Re-elaborating the equipotentials
Related graphical examples can be found inside [20] by Needham and, for holo-
morphic dynamics, in [19] by Milnor { although they weakly already appeared
in older publications [21, 23]. In particular, [19] (p. 123) was rather inspir-
ing to try enhancing graphics as it focused on an imitation graphical model
based upon equipotentials; it also includes the continuous fraction formula of

an irrational argument µ:

yielding an hedgehog with small, non-empty, linearization domain, together
with an (intuitive) ¯gure of it.
5.1 The holed n-th branched star model
The approach roots to one method often applied to dynamical systems, in
general, and in complex analysis too. It is known as `equipotential curve'. The
pseudo{code below was reported to aid the explanation rather than to offer an
implementation(inordertolessenthetranslationtoanotherfavoritelanguage):
it consists of a main routine taking on the input ¯nite subregion ofC as a grid
of seed points z
0
; then the holed star model checks whether the dynamics of
the orbit z
n
should be drawn.

5.2 Unveiling the code
Here we explain the computations performed in the main parts of the code of
section 5.1. First we focus on:

(A) (B) (C)
Figure 5.10 : Wedging the bounded basin (II). Three close-ups of the wedging action along
the hedgehogH generation as the iterates of (2.6) with µ (5.1) are rendered through the holed star
model. The top iteration index was (just!) set at (A) 150, (B) 300 and (C) 1000 respectively. White
disks are preimages of the star hole; colours change depending on the iteration values attained by
the forward images, in respect of their original distribution (refer to ¯g. 4.8 ).
double out_level = ( f.euclidean_dist( z ) <= offset ) ? -1 :
v/potential_rate ;
if the distance of point z, resulting from the iteration process, to the ¯xed
point f is larger than a preset value offset, then the ratio v/potential rate
is computed in order to know whether the iterated point shall be painted black
or not. Otherwise the negative value ¡1 is used as a °ag indicating that the
point shall not be tested again. The container offset stores the radius value
for the hole in the star model. The value v is the argument of the last image z
in the current orbit and helping to have that point location in relation to the
branches. One also notices that
double potential_rate = existence_interval / branches_number ;
when applied to the ¯rst line of code, v / potential rate turns into
index =
v¢branchesnumber
existenceinterval
=
v
existenceinterval
¢branchesnumber:
The ratio on the right is normalized to the unit interval [0;1]; when it is
multiplied by branches number, one ¯nds that:
0 < index < branches number:
So index ranges in the interval of given number of branches. If decimal values
are retrieved, they are rounded off to the lower integer: in fact decimals do
not make sense in terms of branches index. For example, given 31 branches
for the holed star of table 5.13 , we expect the index ranges between [0;30].
The right product with branches number yields the branch index for the last
computation of the n{iterated point.

5.3 Trespassing the equipotentials
Thus it is reasonable to wonder now: given a white background, how come are
black lines painted exclusively? Moreover (since black pixels refer to the only
pointstodraw)why are others not painted? Justbecauseonemethodgenerally
relies upon the condition of trespassing equipotentials to draw screen points.

Figure 5.11 : Indexes for equipotentials. Numbers represent the equipotential levels distribution
in the two models: nested circles and holed star. When indexes change, the ¯nal point belongs to
one indexed region instead of another (the two regions are adjacent because of continuity), and thus
the equipotential curve between is trespassed.
Our computational model looks at the curves locus playing the qualitative
roleanditisoftendescribedbyoneformula. (Forexamplejz¡³j=Rdescribes
a circle centered at ³ or we have an open disc if `=' is replaced with `<'.) For
meeting the machine e±ciency, we need to deal with quality, but in terms of
quantity: so each curve associates to one only index value. When we point
out to one curve or to one branch in the star model, we want its index. The
expression`trespassingtheequipotentials'meansthat,giventhe¯nalindexvalue

index, only the ¯rst one shall be drawn; again, if the indexes of two consecutive
pointsaredifferent,theequipotentialcurvewastrespassedandthesecondpoint
is drawn then. Algorithmically speaking, one stores the last index and, if it
equals the previously stored value, no equipotential is trespassed; otherwise,
the related point is painted black. Implications are straight-forward:
Different indexes!Different equipotential!Trespass!Paint the point:
Forexample,ifweassociateeachscreenpointtotheresultingbranchindex,
we ¯nd out a chain of indexes which then indicates how pixels and the entire
screen row are processed along the raster process from left to right:
1-1-1-2-2-2-2-2-2-3-3-3-3-4-4-4-4-2-2-2-5-5-5-5-3-3-3-3-3

The underlined indexes are those making the difference and each one of them
arrests the previous sub-sequence of same values. The point, relating to the
underlined index, is painted black in our monochromatic version (for colors, we
associate the index value to the color index in the palette). Technically this
can be easily understood by handling the boolean °ag bInitFlag of the main
routine at section 5.1. The reader would take care that, as the bInitFlag is
set,comparisonvaluesarestoredinthetwocontainers valand tmp val,shown
below in the code explaining how the trespass is handled:
BOOL bDraw = Holed_Star( output_z, fxd_pt, double& val, double&
tmp_val, BOOL& bInitFlag ) ;
if ( bInitFlag )
{
if ( val != tmp_val )
{
if ( bDraw ) pDC->SetPixel( x, y , 0 );
val = tmp_val ;
}
}
else bInitFlag = TRUE ;
Itisclearthattheoldequipotentialistrespassedandthepointispaintedblack
(the RGB triplet is set to 0) only when
if ( val != tmp val )
So we `jump'
18
to the adjacent equipotential level. And the new value val =
tmp val is taken on for further comparisons.
5.4 Stars and equivalent classes
With regard of their fate (see section 5.5), the holed star model classi¯es orbits

where k is the number of the branches. For any bounded top index, the iterate

(since every orbits belongs to the class de¯ned by the branch it lands on), they
do not belong to any class E

. Again, the holed star model maps B

to the
union of the regions between the branches. The equivalence classes allow to
reconstruct the basins distribution in the same fashion as of the star model:
so one also understands why it also works ¯nely with the Fatou-Leau °ower, a
similarly shaped vector ¯eld, where one basin wedges the other.
The branches of the star model elongate from the outer region up to the
disc, or to the center point if the hole has zero area: this is not merely obvious
and plays relevantly during orbits classi¯cation. In a similar fashion but when
applied to iterates, the imitation of the branches distribution allows to track
down the wedging action of B

up the boundary of the hole or, again, to
the center of the star when the hole is empty: even here, consequentially, the

reason why one needs to know the radius value.) Along a different path than in
section 5.5, we came to the same great bene¯t: the graphical imitation, up to
the hole boundary, performed by the holed star with regard to hedgehogs and,
as we will see further, for Fatou-Leau's °owers too, since they enjoy a similar,
less complicate, starred topology.

From the early works by Cherry [10] and the later production by P¶ erez-Marco
[22], hedgehogs dynamics can be simply resumed as follows ([10], p. 33):

such `ray' is a connected closed set, and `most' of them are arbitrarily

In equipotential terms, it is the same as drawing the contour of the star.

All in all, the star model bene¯ts are two-fold: while the regions imitate as
best as possible such dynamics inside the bounded basin, the branch lines are
screening the shape of the basin B

basinarecomplementarysets,intermsofconvergingorbits,trackingdowntheir

fjords will tend to (¯gs. 5.12 ). Equipotential models, endowing with different
graphical styles, may be thought as sort of interpreters, where the ¯ttest one
`speaks in the same terms' as the local dynamics at a ¯xed point of f(z).
Lacks: more than any other equipotential model, the holed star does not
grant an `intelligent approach', that is, able to ¯t the topological characters of
any localinvariantset, given theinputfunction f(z). Equipotentialcurvesjust
play as a sort of elastic sheet stretched by the action of f(z) and they are used
then to look at the local dynamics via distributed lines: one then understands
that the knowledge of given local set properties is required for the most ¯tting
choice of the equipotential model among a bunch of them featuring different
distributions (horizontal or vertical straight-lines, concentric discs, stars): in
fact each model works differently on a same case and thus may be more or
less reliable. The hedgehog and the holed star model even enjoy this empirical
rule, so the ¯ne tunings for the star may ensure the most resembling results.

The holed star enjoys a less `ready{to{go' approach than concentric circles or

5.12 , the ¯laments in this full view show how the hedgehog is wedging the whole basin of attraction.
5.6 Tuning the disc radius
The ¯gures 5.13 show the results corresponding to different tunes of the max-
imal disc/hole radius r
S
. Fine tunes are then required: for large values, the
hole boundary is rather deformed, whereas smaller radii retrieve discs which
may not evince the true extension of the Siegel compactum. The problem of
determining a sharp estimation of the Siegel disc radius was mathematically
discussed and cracked by the author: it represents one application of a wider

5.7 Displaying the Fatou-Leau °owers
Since the holed star model was acknowledged to work ¯nely for the hedgehog
| one might like to extend it to Fatou-Leau's °owers as we did in table 5.15 ,
since both invariant sets are resembling as well as °owers can be regarded like
stars with empty hole (radius is 0).

One ¯rst notices that straight lines meet at the origin and they lie at the at-
tractingdirections, whereasthedivergentonesare deformedintopetals-shaped
curves. Like for any indifferent point, the convergence speed rate slows down
in the °ower neighborhoods; even here, the holed star model helps to go all
the way down to ± and save long time computations. It is also useful to re-
mark that here straight segments to the origin are drawn by orbits inside the
converging petals. The application to these °owered invariant sets plays as
another evidence attesting the bene¯ts of such a qualitative approach; again
the star parameters need to be tuned appropriately, although it is much easier

here: in fact the radius hole is always 0 and the branches number can be easily
found mathematically. For more correct pictures, one shall be sure to set them
adjacently to the alternating (convergent and divergent) directions.

7 Conclusions
In author's opinion, well-drawn ¯gures of local invariant sets necessarily want
customized approaches: empirically, equipotentials seem the best performing
today, susceptible to optimizations coming from the application of topologi-
cally equivalent models. A general method working for any local invariant set,
independently from the input map, thus could be a utopia. Keeping on being

open-minded to any possibilities offered by Science, anyway one optimistically
would like to add the words `up to now !'
