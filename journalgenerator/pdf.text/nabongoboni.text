tains all P-null sets (see [11]). Let us notice that our stochastic differential
equation is given in Stratonovich form. It is well known that if a SDE is given
in It form, it may be rewritten in Stratonovich form. In fact, if X(t) solves
dX =−f(X)dt+g(X)dW, where the SDE is given in It form, thenX(t) solves

The ﬁrst SDE dates back to 1930 and has been written by Uhlenbeck and Orn-
stein(see[17])andhasbeenusedasamodelfortheBrownianmotion(irregular
motion of a particle suspended in a ﬂuid ﬁrst observed on the microscope by
the botanist Brown in the XIX century). A mathematical study of SDE
s
is
due to It half a century age and they have extensively used in practically all
branches of science and technology from physics to biology (see [1], [4], [9],
[11]–[13], [15]-[17] and the references cited therein). We know that a solution
X(t) of the SDE in (1)–(2) may extinct in a ﬁnite time, namely there exists a
ﬁnite time T such that X(t) > 0 for t ∈ (0,T) but X(t) = 0 for t ≥ T. The
time T is called the extinction time of X(t). In the case of ordinary differential
Electronic Journal. , http://www.math.spbu.ru/diffjournal/ 16Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 1, 2008
equations (ODE), one may determine easily the extinction time in a lot of sit-
uations. In the case of SDE, the problem is more complicated because of the
stochastic term. Our aim in this paper is to describe the extinction time when
ε is small enough. Our work was motived by the paper of Friedman and Lacey
in [8] and the one of Groisman and Rossi in [10], concerning the phenomenon
of blow-up (we say that a solution blows up in a ﬁnite time if it reaches the
value inﬁnity in a ﬁnite time). In [8], Friedman and Lacey have considered the
following initial-boundary value problem
u
t
(x,t) =εΔu(x,t)+f(u(x,t)) in Ω×(0,T),
u(x,t) = 0 on ∂Ω×(0,T),

(x) is a continuous function in Ω.
Under some additional conditions on the initial data, they have shown that
if ε is small enough, the solution u of the above problem blows up in a ﬁnite
time and its blow-up time goes to the one of the solution α(t) of the following
differential equation
α

Let us notice that the blow-up time of the solution α(t) of the differential
equation is given by T

. A similar result has been obtained by
Groisman and Rossi in [10], where they have considered the SDE below
dX =f(X)dt+σ(X,ε)

X(0) =x

.
In this problem, σ(X,ε) which represents the diffusion of the SDE plays the
same role as εΔu of the partial differential equation considered in [8]. In this
paper, we obtain an analogous result for the problem of extinction.
Our paper is written in the following manner. In the next section, we show
that when ε is small enough, any solution X(t) of the SDE deﬁned in (1)–(2)
extincts in a ﬁnite time and its extinction time goes to the one of the solution
of a certain differential equation. Finally, in the last section, we extend the
results of section 2 to other classes of extinction problems.

2 Extinction times
In this section, under some conditions, we show that if ε is small enough, any
solution X(t) of (1)–(2) extincts in a ﬁnite and its extinction time goes the one
of the solution of a certain ordinary differential equation (ODE). For the sake
of simplicity, let us start with an example concerning the ODEs.
Consider the following ODE
y
0
(t) =−y
p
(t), t> 0, (3)
y(0) =M > 0, (4)
where p> 0. An explicit solution of (3)–(4) is given by
y(t) =
1
(M
1−p
+(p−1)t)
1
p−1
if p> 1,
y(t) =Me
−t
if p = 1,
y(t) = (M
1−p
−(1−p)t)
1
p−1
+
if 0<p< 1,
where (x)
+
= max{x,0}.
Thus, we see that if p≥ 1, 0 < y(t) < M for t≥ 0 and lim
t→+∞
y(t) = 0, but
if 0 < p < 1, 0 < y(t) < M for t∈ [0,
M
1−p
1−p
) but y(t) = 0 for t≥
M
1−p
1−p
. In this
case, we say that the solution y(t) of (3)–(4) extincts in a ﬁnite time and the
time T
0
=
M
1−p
1−p
is called the extinction time of the solution y(t).
More generally, consider the following ODE
α
0
(t) =−f(α(t)), t> 0, (5)
α(0) =M > 0 (6)
where f(s)∈C
1
(R) is a positive and increasing function for the positive values
of s. It is well known that if the integral
R
M
0
ds
f(s)
diverges then the solution
α(t) of (5)–(6) satisﬁes 0<α(t)<M and lim
t→+∞
α(t) = 0 but if the integral
R
M
0
ds
f(s)
converges then the solution of (5)–(6) extincts in a ﬁnite time and its
extinction time T
0
is given by T
0
=
R
M
0
ds
f(s)
.
Thus, we see that for certain ODEs, the extinction times of solutions are given
explicitly.
Now, let us consider the SDE
s
. Our ﬁrst result is the following.

Theorem 1 Suppose that σ(X,ε) = εX and
R
0

f(s)
< +∞. Then for almost
every ω, any solution X(t) of the SDE in (1)–(2) extincts in a ﬁnite time for
every ε> 0 and its extinction time T

goes to
R

Proof. Since σ(X,ε) =εX, then we have
dX =−f(X)dt+εX

Setting Z = Xe

which implies that

This gives a non-autonomous ODE for each ω such that W(.,ω) is continuous,

Consider now the SDE in to sense. It may be rewritten as follows
dX =−f(X)dt+εXdW, (7)
X(0) =x
0
. (8)
We have the following result.
Theorem 2 Theorem 1 remains valid if X(t) solves (7)–(8).
Proof. Applying the formula given in the introduction, the SDE in (7)–(8)
may be rewritten in Stratonovich sense in the following manner
dX =−f(X)−

Now, let us consider the general case. We have the following result.
Theorem 3 Let φ

Then for almost every ω, any solution of (1)–(2) extincts in a ﬁnite time and

then there exists a random variable K = K(ω) such that with total probability

Proof. Since φ

Therefore, X is a solution of the SDE deﬁned in (1)–(2). On the other hand,
from (13)–(14), we get

3 Other extinctions times
In this section, we show the possibility to extend the results of the previous
section to another problem of extinction which is called problem of quenching.
To illustrate our analysis, let us consider the following ODE
y
0
(t) =−y
−p
(t), t> 0, (18)
y(0) =M > 0, (19)
where p> 0. An explicit solution of (18)–(19) is given by
y(t) = (M
p+1
−(p+1)t)
1
p+1
for t∈ [0,
M
p+1
p+1
).
Hence we see that if t =
M
p+1
p+1
then y(t) reaches the value zero which implies
that y
0
(t) explodes at the same time. In this case, we say that the solution y(t)
quenches in a ﬁnite time.
More generally, consider the following ODE
y
0
(t) =−f(y(t)), t> 0, (20)
y(0) =M > 0, (21)
where f(s) is a positive, decreasing function for the positive values of s,
lim
s→0

When σ(X,ε) = εX, the above theorem reveals that any solution of (22)–(23)
quenches in a ﬁnite time. In the following, we want to know what happens if
we consider the SDE in to sense. In this case, our problem can be rewritten as
follows
dX =−f(X)dt+εXdW, (24)

. (25)
The result below gives an answer when the SDE is taken in to sense.
Theorem 5 Theorem 4 remains valid if X(t) solves (24)–(25).
Proof. Taking into account the formula given in the introduction, the SDE in
(24)–(25) may be rewritten in Stratonovich sense in the following manner

Use the fact that X = e

proof.  
Now, let us consider the general case concerning the phenomenon of quenching.
We can derive the following important result.
Theorem 6 Let φ

(s,x) be the ﬂux associated to the ODE ˙ y =σ(y,ε), y(0) =
x and let H(s,x,ε) =
f(φ

σ(φ

. Suppose that
lim

H(s,x,ε) = +∞, lim
ε→0
H(s,x,ε) =f(x), (26)
H(s,x,ε)≥H(t,x,ε) if s≥t (27)
and there exists a function k
s
(x) such that
1
H(s,x,ε)
≤k
s
(x)∈L

([0,x

]). (28)
Then for almost every ω, any solution of (22)–(23) quenches in a ﬁnite time
and its quenching time T
ω
ε
satisﬁes the following relation lim
ε→0
T
ω
ε
=T

where

such that
∂

H(s,x,ε)

then there exists a random variable K = K(ω) such that with total probability
|T

|≤εK.
Proof. Since φ

(t,x) is the ﬂux of the following ODE
˙ y =σ(y,ε),
y(0) =x,
we easily see that

Setting
