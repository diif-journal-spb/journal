A Numerical-Analytical Method for Constructing Periodic
Solutions of the Lorenz System

Abstract. This article describes a method for constructing approximations to
periodic solutions of dynamic Lorenz system with classical values of the system
parameters. The author obtained a system of nonlinear algebraic equations in
general form concerning of the cyclic frequency, constant terms and amplitudes
of harmonics that make up harmonic approximations to the desired solutions.
The initial approximation for the Newton method is selected, which converges
to a solution describing a periodic solution different from the equilibrium posi-
tion. The results of a computational experiment are presented. The results are
veri ed using high-precision calculations.
Keywords: Attractor, Lorenz Attractor, Trigonometric Polynomial, Newton's
Method.
1 Introduction
Let us consider the nonlinear system of differential equations introduced by E.

where   = 10, r = 28 and b = 8=3 are the classical values of the system
parameters.

. It is proved in the article
[1] that there exists a number C > 0 such that for any solution X(t) of the
system (1), starting at time moment,jX(t)j < C, and the divergence of the
vector velocity  eld of the system (1) is negative everywhere inR
3
for classical
values of the system parameters. Then [1] there exists a limit set, called the
Lorenz attractor, to which all trajectories of the dynamical system are attracted
when time tends to in nity. Thus the attractor determines the behavior of the
solutions of a dynamical system over large segments of time.
W. Tucker in his work [2] proved that the attractor is hyperbolic in the
system (1), that is, the attractor consists of cycles everywhere dense on it along
which the near trajectories diverge exponentially. This creates their chaotic
behavior.
As know [3, 4], the symbolic dynamics is used to track cycles in the Lorenz
system. The region in the phase space containing the attractor is divided into
a  nite number of subdomains. Denoting each partition element by a symbol,
the trajectories on the attractor passing through the corresponding regions are
encoded by sequences of such symbols. If the sequence has regularity (repeata-
bility of groups of characters), then we have a cycle. However, the return of
trajectories in a neighborhood of its part does not mean its closure. A critique
of the results of such computational experiments can be found, for example, in
[5].
In 2004, D. Viswanath published the paper [6], in which he presented the
initial conditions and periods for three cycles in the Lorenz attractor with a
high accuracy. The calculation algorithm is based on the Lindstedt-Poincar  e
(LP) method, which (unlike numerical integration methods) is not affected by
the stability of the cycle to which approximations are constructed.
An analysis of the Viswanath's articles [6, 7] showed that the author gives
a general description of the algorithm without reference to the computer im-
plementation (in MATLAB as indicated in his works). Moreover, it is not clear
how the obtained inhomogeneous linear system of differential equations with
periodic coe cients is symbolically solved by the LP-method. For example,
this can be done for the Van der Pol equation without any special problems.
In the article [6] Viswanath showed data that can be veri ed by solving the
Cauchy problem with high-precision numerical methods (for example, [8]), but
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 60Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2020
the details of the algorithm are not disclosed.
Therefore, it is important here to obtain the values of the initial conditions
and the period with a given accuracy, having described in detail the implemen-
tation of the cycles search algorithm in the system (1).
The goal of this article is to develop a numerical-analytical method for
constructing approximations to periodic solutions of the Lorenz system, which
is simpler to implement than the LP-method. In this case, a system of nonlinear
algebraic equations concerning of the cyclic frequency, constant terms, and
amplitudes of harmonics making up the desired solution will be obtained in
general form.
2 A Numerical-Analytical Method
Attempts to construct approximate periodic solutions in the system (1) with
were made before Viswanath (for example, [9]) by the method of harmonic
balance, but with low accuracy in representing real numbers, while in the article
[9] initial conditions and periods of found cycles are not indicated (only drawings
with cycles are given). Now this method is actively developing in the works of
[10, 11, 12] A. Luo to  nd periodic solutions of nonlinear systems of differential
equations.
Next, we describe a numerical-analytical method for constructing approxi-
mations to periodic solutions of the system (1). We make for this an approxi-
mation of the phase coordinates on the period T by trigonometric polynomials
in general form with an unknown cyclic frequency! (since we do not know the
value of T ; in the general case, it can be an irrational number):

By the right-hand side of the system (1), we compose the residuals

(t) = ~ x
0
1
(t)  [~ x
2
(t)  ~ x
1

(t) = ~ x

3
(t) = ~ x
0
3
(t)  [~ x
1
(t)~ x
2
(t) b~ x
3
(t)];
where the prime denotes the time derivative of the function. If we make calcu-
lations in an analytical form, then for each residual you need the following:
1. Differentiate by time the corresponding trigonometric polynomial;
2. Where there are products of phase coordinates, multiply the correspond-
ing trigonometric polynomials, converting the products of trigonometric
functions into sums;
3. Give similar terms for each function cos() and sin() with the corresponding
argument;
4. By virtue of the equalities (2), to cut off the higher-order harmonics from
the resulting residual;
5. Set the resulting residual to zero, i.e., coe cients at its harmonics.
If we put together the found algebraic equations for each residual, we obtain
a still unclosed system of nonlinear equations concerning of unknown amplitudes

(i = 1;h), constant terms x

and x

and
the cyclic frequency !. The number of unknown variables in the system is
3(1 + 2h) + 1 = 6h + 4, but the equations are one less.
An additional equation can be taken from the following considerations. It
is known (see [4, 6]) that the desired cycles intersect the plane passing through
the equilibrium positions of the system (1)

and parallel to the planex

(a Poincare section). Then the third coordinate
in the initial condition for the desired cycles is equal to r  1, whence ~ x

(0) =
r  1.
Therefore the additional equation of the system has the form:

The author did not  nd in literature of other additional information on the
periodic solutions in the Lorenz system. Note that for the three cycles found
by Viswanath, in the initial condition for the third coordinate, the number 27
was taken.
Next, we give an example of a system of equations for h = 2:

Therefore the resulting nonlinear system of algebraic equations has a non-
unique solution. To  nd its approximate solutions, we will use the Newton

numerical method, whose a convergence to the desired solution (i.e., describing
a periodic solution of the system (1) different from its the equilibrium positions)
depends on the choice of the initial approximation.
3 The Symbolic Computations to Obtain the System of
Algebraic Equations
Thus, to obtain an approximation to the periodic solution, we must obtain
a nonlinear system concerning of unknown decomposition coe cients and fre-
quencies. As shown in the previous section, even for two harmonics, the system
has a bulky form. Therefore, we consider the algorithm for performing symbolic
calculations to obtain it.
When developing software [13], the Maxima math package (a computer
algebra system) was chosen. The program for obtaining the amplitudes and
constant terms of the residuals for h = 2 is presented below.

The expression display2d:false$ turns off multi-line drawing of fractions,
degrees, etc. The sign $ allows to calculate the result of an expression, but
not display it (instead of ;). The function trigreduce(expression,t) col-
lapses all products of trigonometric functions concerning of the variable t in
a combination of sums. Differentiation of residuals according to harmonic
functions is necessary to obtain the corresponding amplitudes. The function
expand(expression) expands brackets (performs multiplication, exponentia-
tion, leads similar terms).
To  nd the constant terms of the residuals, their integration over the period
is applied, i.e. the constant term of the k-residual is

:
So that during symbolic integration the package does not ask a question
about the sign of the frequency, a command is given assume(omega > 0)$.
A  le with package commands is generated similarly for any number of h
harmonics by a computer program written in C++ [13]. After executing this
program, the package will output symbolic expressions to the console for the
left side of the system of algebraic equations, which will be solved in it by the
Newton method.
Note that the most time-consuming operation here is symbolic integration.
For example, for 120 harmonics, the system formation time is more than 2 days.
We can here parallelize the computational process on three computers, but this
will not have a signi cant effect. Therefore, a system of algebraic equations
must be formed immediately. Next, we get a general form of this system. Note
that when solving the system of nonlinear equations by the Newton method,
the Jacobi matrix for the left side of the system does not invert. The Maxima
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 65Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2020
package uses LU decomposition to solve a system of linear equations at each
iteration of the method.
4 General Form of the System of Algebraic Equations
Since the right-hand side of the (1) system contains nonlinearities in the form
of products of phase coordinates, let us obtain relations expressing the coe -
cients of trigonometric polynomials obtained by multiplying the approximations

(t) and ~ x

(t)~ x

(t).
We consider two functions f(t) and F (t) represented by Fourier series

Let

i=1
(ff

sin(i!t)):
Following the book [14, pp. 123-125], we have the relations:

We assume that for i>h

Since for our problem we  nd for an approximation up to and including the

Thus, we pass from the product of series to the product of trigonometric
polynomials. Also in the relations (4) and (5) we will assume [14, p. 124] that

With such parameters of the method, the approximate values of the phase
coordinates obtained by numerical integration were also veri ed by the same
numerical method, but in reverse time. The values in the reverse time coincide
with (6) up to the 9th character inclusive after the point. The resulting values
of x

(T ) coincide with (6) up to the 8th character inclusive.
The cycle corresponding to (6) is shown in Fig. 1. Note that the cycle
found coincides with the  rst Viswanath cycle in [6], all signs after the point
for T also coincide with the data from [6].
