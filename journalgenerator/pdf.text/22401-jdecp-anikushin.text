Abstract. W e study the well-posedness of nonautonomous nonlinear delay equa-

as evolutionary equations in a proper Hilbert space. W e present a
construction of solving operators (nonautonomous case) or nonlinear semigroups
(autonomous case) for a large class of such equations. The main idea can be
easily extended for certain PDEs with delay . Our approach has lesser limitations
and much more elementary than some previously known constructions of such
semigroups and solving operators based on the theory of accretive operators. In
the autonomous case we also study di erentiability properties of these semigroups
in order to apply v arious dimension estimates using the Hilbert space geometry .
However, obtaining e ective dimension estimates for delay equations is a nontriv-
ial problem and we explain it by means of a scalar delay equation. W e also discuss
our adjacent results concerned with inertial manifolds and their construction for
delay equations.

the monograph of A. B  atk ai and S. Piazzera [10] we have that A is a generator
of a C

operator C:H→R

as C(x,ϕ ):=

). Now (1.1) can be
written as an abstract evolution equation in H:
˙ v(t)=Av(t)+BF(t,Cv(t)), (1.5)

for which we will study the question of well-posedness. In our Theorem 1 be-
low we precisely state in what sense solutions to this evolution equation can be
understood.
W e put E := C([− τ, 0];R

ϕ 7→ (ϕ (0),ϕ ). W e identify the elements of E andH under such an embedding.

the main ingredient of our proofs in the  rst part.

In fact, we can use the density of δ -functionals in the weak-* topology of
C([− τ, 0];R) and approximations by such functionals given by the Riesz rep-
resentation theorem to show that (MES) holds for any operator
e
C (with similar
arguments in the case n≥ 1, r ≥ 1, see Lemma 2.1 below). This simple obser-
v ation besides the results contained in the present paper also led to a version of
the F requency Theorem for delay equations [2]. The L
2
-version of (MES) helps
to prove di erentiability properties of constructed semigroups (see Section 3).
One of our main results is the following.

R emark 2. F or our further investigations it is important that if the constant Λ( t)
from (1.2) can be chosen independently of t, then the constants from (ULIP)
depend only on T (or t− s), but not on s.
Our approach for Theorem 1 is very simple and it is based on three steps. The
 rst one is the well-posedness of the linear problem in H, including exponential
estimates and the v ariation of constants formula. Such results for (partial) delay
equations are given in [10]. The second step is the existence of classical solutions
(in the space of continuous functionsE) for the nonlinear problem, which give rise
to classical solutions of the non-linear problem in H. The existence of solutions in
E is well-known for delay equations inR
n
(see, for example, J.K. Hale [21]) as well
Electronic Journal. h ttp://di journal.spbu.ru/ 4Di er ential Equations and Contr ol Pr o c esses, N. 4, 2022
as for some partial delay equations (see, for example, I. Chueshov [17]). The third
step is the deriv ation of elementary a priori estimates for the norm of classical
solutions inH with the use of the v ariation of constants formula, estimates for the
linear problem, (1.2) and (MES). This allows us to obtain generalized solutions
by continuity . Thus, the conclusion of Theorem 1 can be easily extended to some
partial di erential equations with delay .
The well-posedness of nonlinear autonomous and nonautonomous (partial)
delay equations in Banach spaces was studied in several papers, for example, [19,
43, 42]. The main approach in these papers is based on applications of the theory
of accretive operators. Besides the fact that the theory itself is nonelementary and
its applications require pages and pages of v arious estimates, in applications to
delay equations one faces with several restrictions. F or example, to apply results
of G. F. W ebb [43] and G.F. W ebb and M. Badii [42] to ODEs in R
n
with delay ,
the number of  independent  discrete delays, roughly speaking, cannot exceed n
that is unnatural. In [42] there is also assumed some smoothness of the right-
hand side in t, which is linked with the construction of a family of equiv alent
norms to obtain the accretiveness condition. In the paper of M. F aheem and
M.R.M. Rao [19] only the case of nonautonomous delay di erential equations in
R
n
is considered. Their main restriction is posed on the nonlinear part that must
be everywhere de ned in H (i. e. no discrete delays can appear in the nonlinear
term) and some smoothness in t is also assumed. However, the authors of [19]
considered a nonautonomous linear part and showed the well-posedness for the
linear problem, but their assumptions on the linear part in our context allow to
consider it as a nonlinear part of (1.1), i. e. (1.2) and (MES) are satis ed. Thus,
our Theorem 1 covers in most and largely extends the  nal result of [19] as well as
results from [43, 42]. Moreover, if we put
e
A=0 in (1.1), then the generation of a
C
0
-semigroup for the operator A is easier to obtain. Now, if we make F(t,
e
Cx
t
)
to be a linear function of x
t
for each t, then Theorem 1 can be considered as a
well-posedness theorem for linear nonautonomous delay equations in H. There
are other papers on the question of well-posedness for delay equations, which use
more concrete approaches (see D. Breda [12] and links therein), but none of them
entirely covers the result of Theorem 1 and cannot compete with the simplicity
of its proof.
W e also note that the studying of delay equations in the Hilbert space setting
is rarely seen in works on dynamical systems. F or example, recent monographs
on in nite-dimensional dynamical systems (see A.N. Carv alho, J.A. Langa and
J.C. Robinson [13]; I. Chueshov [17]) treat delay equations in the space of contin-
Electronic Journal. h ttp://di journal.spbu.ru/ 5Di er ential Equations and Contr ol Pr o c esses, N. 4, 2022
uous functions. Below we will justify adv antages of the Hilbert space geometry
for understanding of the dynamics of such equations.
Namely , the obtained v ariation of constants formula (V AR) is useful for
applications of the F requency Theorem [2, 28] (a theorem that allows to construct
quadratic Lyapunov functionals, which we use to construct inertial manifolds)
since it allows to pass from the nonlinear equation to a linear inhomogeneous
system, which is studied in the context of the theorem
*
. It is also convenient
for studying of almost periodic in time equations, where, as it is well-known, one
should compactify the equation by considering the so-called limiting equations and
check the continuous dependence with respect to perturbations of the right-hand
side. W e refer to our works [1, 5] for applications to such and other equations in the
in nite-dimensional context. In  nite-dimensions the F requency Theorem (also
known as the Kalman-Y akubovich-Popov lemma) has already proved to be useful
for studying of dimensional-like properties of autonomous and almost periodic
ODEs (see, for example, M.M. Anikushin [9, 7]; M.M. Anikushin, V. Reitmann
and A.O. Romanov [8]; N.V. Kuznetsov and V. Reitmann [24] and references
therein for a range of applications).
Theorem 1 is also convenient for studying of di erentiability properties of
semigroups (see Section 3) and inertial manifolds (see Section 5). W e do not ex-
plicitly state these results in this introduction because strict formulations require
long preparations. Along with Theorem 1 these results form a basis for parts of
our adjacent works [1, 5, 3] concerned with delay equations.
A part of the present work is motiv ated by our previous paper [6] on the
existence of inv ariant topological manifolds for cocycles in Hilbert spaces and es-
pecially Problem 2 posed therein, which asks for extensions of the theory for delay
equations with discrete delays. At Appendix A we present such an extension of
the theory , which also gives a solution to Problem 1 from [6] asking for conditions
to provide continuous dependence of the inertial manifold  bres. In fact, under
some natural additional assumptions these manifolds possess classical properties
such as exponential tracking and normal hyperbolicity , which are proved and dis-
cussed within a more general context in our adjacent work [1]. In the present
paper we discuss these extensions for delay equations in Section 5.
Concerning inertial manifolds for delay equations, here we should mention
the paper of C. Chicone [15], which extends classical results of Y u.A. Ryabov
and R.D. Driver, devoted to inertial manifolds for delay equations. The theory

considered in [15] allows to construct n-dimensional inertial manifolds for delay
equations inR
n
with small delays. F or comparison, our approach has some deli-
cateness in applications, where the F requency Theorem for delay equations [2] is
used. In particular, it allows to construct inertial manifolds with the dimension
that is not limited to n as in [15]. Moreover, it is shown in [2] that results from
[15] can be deduced (with relaxed in some cases conditions) in most from the F re-
quency Theorem and our general theory from [1] (which, as we have mentioned,
uses results of the present paper) after simple computations.
Our results from [1, 4, 2] allow to consider v arious inertial manifolds theo-
ries within a general geometric context based on the use of quadratic Lyapunov
functionals. In particular, it is shown by the author in [4] that the Spectral Gap
Condition, used by C. F oias, G.R. Sell and R. T emam [40] (see also the survey of
S. Zelik [44]) is a particular case of some frequency inequality arising in v arious
versions of the F requency Theorem, which provides the existence of quadratic
functionals. This frequency inequality was also used by R.A. Smith [35, 34] for
his developments of the Poincar  e-Bendixson theory for delay equations in R
n
and
certain reaction-di usion equations
  . Moreover, in the surveys of A. Kostianko et
al. [23] or S. Zelik [44] it is shown that the Spatial A veraging Principle, which was
proposed by J. Mallet-Paret and G. R. Sell to relax the Spectral Gap Condition in
some cases, also lead to the existence of certain quadratic functionals. F or more
discussions in this direction see [1, 4, 2]. Note also that our geometric approach
can be also applied to construct stable/unstable and local center manifolds along
inv ariant sets.
Besides the above mentioned construction of quadratic Lyapunov function-
als, an adv antage may be given by possible applications of dimension estimates,
which use the Hilbert space geometry , and approximation of dimension-like char-
acteristics and spectra (see D. Breda and E. V an Vleck [11]). In this direction
we prove in Section 3 the C
1
-di erentiability property for semigroups in H gen-
erated by (1.1) with F ∈ C
1
and F
′
globally bounded. This allows to apply
well-known dimension estimates for the fractal dimension (see V.V. Chepyzhov
and A.A. Ilyin [14]), the Hausdor  dimension (see R. T emam [40], J. Mallet-Paret
[31]) and the topological entropy (see N.V. Kuznetsov and V. Reitmann [24]) of
compact inv ariant sets. However, obtaining e ective dimension estimates for delay
equations seems to be a nontrivial problem and we try to discuss its nontriviality
in Section 3. This can be seen also from rare papers on the topic, where the
  Note that R.A. Smith did not use quadratic Ly apuno v functionals in the in nite-dimensional case, probably
due to his inabilit y to sho w their existence. Our extensions of the F requency Theorem presen ted in [2, 4] sho w

pioneering paper of J. Mallet-Paret [31] and a paper of J.W-H. So and J. W u [38]
should be mentioned. Both of the papers represent an approach, which somehow
utilizes compactness of the di erentials to show  nite-dimensionality (as well as
in the mentioned monographs [13, 17, 21]) and does not provide any e ective
estimates. It seems that the authors of [38] were the  rst to mention some non-
triviality of the problem, but they did not provide any discussions on it (referring
to subsequent works that never appeared). Moreover, in [29] J. Mallet-Paret and
R.D. Nussbaum studied compound processes arising from linear nonhomogeneous
scalar delay equations with monotone feedback (such equations may appear after
linearization). Their nontrivial results show that such compound processes for
certain powers (corresponding either to odd or even-dimensional volumes growth)
preserves a convex reproducing normal cone of rank 1. This allows us to treat the
problem in the general context of spectral theory . Here the v ariational principle
for subadditive functions proved by P . Thieullen [41], which allows to describe
the largest uniform Lyapunov exponent of the compound cocycle as a Lyapunov
exponent over some ergodic measure, is crucial for understanding of the problem.
In Section 4, by means of the Suarez-Schopf model for ENSO [39], we use this
approach to obtain e ective conditions for the nonexistence of periodic orbits and
homoclinics. T o the best of our knowledge, this is the  rst time when the criterion
of R.A. Smith [33] and its developments by M.Y. Li and J.S. Muldowney [27] are
e ectively applied for equations with delay .
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we prove Theorem 1. In
Section 3 we prove a theorem on C
1
-di erentiability of the semigroup given by
(1.5) in the autonomous case (Theorems 2 and 3). Here we also consider the
problem of obtaining e ective dimension estimates (see Problem 1) and discuss
its nontriviality . In Section 4 we consider the Suarez-Schopf model for El Ni  no
given by a scalar delay equation, pose a problem linked with dimension estimates
and give a partial solution. In Section 5 we discuss inertial manifolds and their
properties, including C
1
-di erentiability (see Theorem 11), normal hyperbolic-
ity and exponential tracking. Moreover, we obtain dimension estimates using
some Riemannian metric, which naturally arises from the construction of inertial
manifolds (see Theorem 12). In Section 6 we continue our investigation of the
Suarez-Schopf model and obtain conditions for the existence of one-dimensional
and two-dimensional inertial manifolds (see Theorems 13 and 14). At Appendix
A we present a generalization of our main result from [6], which is, in particular,
convenient for delay equations.

2 Construction of delay semigroups
At  rst we state here a lemma from [2], which in particular shows that (MES)
is satis ed for any operator
e
C . Let T > 0 and consider the subspace S

such that there exists a continuous function x: [− τ,T ]→R

with the property
ϕ (t)=x

for all t≥ 0. The following lemma is Lemma 8 from [2].

Using Lemma 2.1 with p = 1, we get that (MES) with M

is satis ed for the operator C corresponding to
e
C from (1.1).
R emark 3. F rom the Riesz representation theorem, there exists a r× n-matrix-
v alued function of bounded v ariation γ (θ ), where θ ∈[− τ, 0], such that
e
Cϕ =

− τ dγ (θ )ϕ (θ ) for any ϕ ∈C([− τ, 0];R

). (2.2)
It can be shown that M
e
C
≤ Varγ , where Var is the total v ariation on [− τ, 0] (see
[2]).
R emark 4. Let us consider the space H

of all functions ϕ (·) ∈
C([0,T];L
p
(− τ, 0);R

) such that for some x(·)∈L
p

) we haveϕ (t)=x

for all t≥ 0. It is convenient to endow H

where

is well-de ned. Moreover, its norm is independent of T and p. This is the sense
in which the v ariation of constants formula from (1.10) can be understood for any
v

The following lemma is Theorem 3.23 from [10].

The following lemma is a particular case of Lemma 3.6 from [10].
Lemma 2.3. L et x: [− τ, ∞) → R
n
b e a function such that x ∈
W
1,2
loc
([− τ, ∞);R
n
). De ne the history function
  ϕ (t) := x
t
for t ≥ 0. Then
ϕ ∈C

([0,+∞);L
2
(− τ, 0;R
n
)) and for al l t≥ 0 we have ϕ (t)∈W
1,2
(− τ, 0;R
n
)
and
˙
ϕ (t)=
d
dθ
ϕ (t) in L
2
(− τ, 0;R
n
). (2.6)
An immediate consequence of Lemma 2.3 is the following.
Cor ol lary 1. Let x(t) = x(t,t
0
,ϕ 0
) be the classical solution to (1.1) such that
ϕ 0
∈ W
1,2
(− τ, 0;R
n
). Then the function v(t) = (x(t),x
t
), t ≥ t
0
, is a classical
solution to (1.5) with v
0
:= v(t
0
) = ϕ 0
(or, more precisely , v(t
0
) = (ϕ 0
(0),ϕ 0
)).
Moreover, if we put ξ (t) := F(Cv(t)), then v(·) also satis es the inhomogeneous
equation
˙ v(t)=Av(t)+Bξ (t) (2.7)
and, in particular, the v ariation of constants formula for t≥ t

R emark 5. An analog of Lemma 2.2 for parabolic or hyperbolic equations can
also be proved (see, for example, Theorem 3.29 in [10]). T o proceed from Lemma
2.3 to Corollary 1 we have to establish the well-posedness (=existence of classical
solutions) in the space of continuous functions. This is also well-studied for partial
di erential equations with delay . See, for example, [17].
Now we can give a proof of Theorem 1.
Pr o of. Let x

), where t ≥ t
0
and j = 1,2, be two classi-
cal solutions to (1.1) and put v

sequence v

1,2
(− τ, 0;R

), where k =1,2,..., tend to v

inH as k→+∞.
Then (2.10) shows that the sequence v

the smoothing property stated in (ULIP). In particular, the map U(t,s) for
t≥ s+τ takes bounded sets inH into bounded sets inE, where U(t,s) coincides
with
e
U(t,s). F rom the Arzel  a-Ascoli theorem, the map
e
U(t,s) for t≥ s+τ takes
bounded sets in E into precompact sets in E. Consequently , U(t,s):H →E is
compact for t≥ s+2τ . This shows (COM). Summarizing the above, it is clear
that (REG) is also satis ed. F rom Corollary 1 and continuity arguments we get
(V AR). The proof is  nished.
3 Di erentiability of delay semigroups
In this section we suppose that (1.1) is autonomous, i. e. F is independent of
t. W e suppose also that F ∈ C

(R

). Note that from (1.2) it immediately
Electronic Journal. h ttp://di journal.spbu.ru/ 11Di er ential Equations and Contr ol Pr o c esses, N. 4, 2022
follows that F
′
is bounded. Let the assumptions of Theorem 1 hold. Then there
is a semi ow φ
t
:H→H given by equation (1.5), i. e. it is de ned as φ
t
(v
0
) :=
v(t,0,v
0
) for all t≥ 0 and v
0
∈H. F or v

∈E one can formally write from (1.5)
the linearized along the tra jectory φ
t
(v

) equation
˙
V(t)=[A+BF

Putting
e
F(t,y):=F
′
(Cφ

(u

))y , we see that (3.1) is of the form (1.5) with F
changed to
e
F . Thus, we have the following well-posedness result for (3.1), which
follows
  from Theorem 1.
Lemma 3.1. F or any v
0
∈ H and ξ 0
∈ H e quation (3.1) has a unique gen-
er alize d solution V(t) = V(t;ξ 0
;v
0
) such that V(0) = ξ 0
. F or ξ 0
∈ D(A) the
solution V(t)=V(t;ξ 0
;v
0
) is a classic al solution, i. e. V(·)∈C
1
([0,+∞);H)∩
C([0,+∞);E), V(t)∈D(A) and V(t) satis es (3.1) for al l t≥ 0.
There is, in fact, continuous dependence of solutions to (3.1) on v
0
∈E that
can be seen from the v ariation of constants formula (V AR) (see Lemma 5.1).
Let K ⊂ H be an inv ariant compact set, i. e. φ
t
(K) = K for all t ≥ 0.
F rom the smoothing property in (ULIP) and the fact that a compact inv ariant
set consists of complete tra jectories we have the inclusion K ⊂ D (A). Let us
formulate the following property .
(MES*) There is a constant M

is satis ed
for any C corresponding to
e
C from (1.1).
F or the proof of di erentiability properties below we need a simple observ ation
given by the following lemma.

  Although formally Theorem 1 is pro v ed for nonlinearities F(t,y), whic h are de ned for t ∈R, it clearly
remains true (with ob vious mo di cations) when w e ha v e t∈[0,+∞) only .

Pr o of. One can prove the continuity at every point by contradiction, combining
the facts that any convergent L

sequence contains a subsequence, which converges
almost everywhere, and the Dominated Convergence Theorem.

The continuity of the map v
0
→L(t;v
0
) plays an important role in dimension
estimates. It is shown by V.V. Chepyzhov and A.A. Ilyin [14] that this property is
the only missing ingredient that makes the Hausdor  dimension estimate obtained
by P . Constantin, C. F oias and R. T emam [40] hold for the fractal dimension also.
This property is also essential for Theorem 4 below.
Note that any inv ariant compact K, thanks to (ULIP), must lie in E and
the topologies of E andH on K coincide. Moreover, from (ULIP) we get that
K is an image of itself under the Lipschitz map φ
2τ . Therefore, the Hausdor 
and fractal dimensions of K w. r. t. the metrics of H andE coincide. Applying
a theorem of J. Mallet-Paret [31] (see also Section 4.6 in [24]) to the compact
F r  echet di erentiable map φ
2τ we get the following theorem.
Theorem 4. Under the hyp otheses of The or em 3 the Hausdor  dimension of K
is  nite.
Moreover, from [14] we can show  niteness of the fractal dimension that is
not less than the Hausdor  dimension (see Remark 3.6 in [24]). F or this we need
some preparations.
F or a compact linear operator L:H → H let α 1
≥ α 2
≥ α 3
≥ ... be its
singular v alues. F or d = k+s, where k is a non-negative integer and s∈ (0,1],
we consider the singular v alue function of L de ned as
ω
d
(L):=α 1
· ...· α k
· α s
k+1
=ω
1− s
k
ω
s
k+1
. (3.18)
F rom Theorem 2.1 in [14] applied to the map φ
t
for some  xed t≥ 2τ we get
the following theorem.
Theorem 5. Under the hyp otheses of The or em 3 supp ose that for some t≥ 2τ and d>0 we have
sup
v∈K
ω
d
(L(t;v))<1. (3.19)
Then for the fr actal dimension of K inH we have dim
F
K <d.
The main result of [14] and the above de nitions can be also formulated for
the case of a non-compact operator L [40]. In our situation, the compactness of
L(t;v) for t ≥ 2τ allows us to stay in the compact context, which is simpler.
Since L(t;v) is a compact operator for t ≥ 2τ , its singular v alues tend to zero
and therefore ω
d
(L(t;v))<1 is satis ed for all su ciently large d>0. Using the
compactness of K and the continuity of L(t,v) (and, consequently , ω
d
(L(t;v)))
w. r. t. v ∈ K, one can show that for every t ≥ 2τ the inequality in (3.19)
Electronic Journal. h ttp://di journal.spbu.ru/ 16Di er ential Equations and Contr ol Pr o c esses, N. 4, 2022
is satis ed for some su ciently large d > 0. Thus, we immediately have the
following theorem which strengthens Theorem 4.
Theorem 6. Under the hyp otheses of The or em 3 the fr actal dimension of K is
 nite.
In particular, from Theorem 6 and the Lipschitz property of the semi ow we
immediately have  niteness of the topological entropy of φ
t
restricted to K (see,
for example, [24]).
It is interesting to obtain e ective dimension estimates and this seems to be a
nontrivial problem. Let us start a discussion by formulating the following analog
of the Liouville trace formula for (3.1).
Lemma 3.3. Under the hyp otheses of The or em 3 let k > 0 b e an inte ger and

Using (3.21) and Lemma 3.3, one usually provides some estimates for the
trace of the operator in (3.20), which makes it possible to apply Theorem 5.
In the case of parabolic problems there is a general estimate for the trace of a
positive self-adjoint operator (see Chapter VI in [40] or Lemma 4.21 in [13]), which
in some cases (for example, for reaction-di usion equations) overrides the e ect
of the nonlineary (that is F in our case) and makes it possible to obtain e ective
dimension estimates. Linear operators corresponding to delay equations are not
self-adjoint and thus it is not obvious how one may derive e ective dimension
estimates with the use of Theorem 5 in the general case. As we will see below, a
naive approach concerned with the study of the symmetrized operator (A+A
∗ )/2
does not work here, although it has proved to be e ective for ODEs (see [24]). W e
are familiar only with the paper of J.W-H. So and J. W u [38], where dimension
estimates for delay equations through the trace estimates are considered (in [38]
a class of parabolic equations with delay is studied). However, [38] ends with
an abstract application of the Constantin-F oias-T emam estimate (in the same
way we did in Theorem 6) and, as it is said in the introduction, its concrete
realizations are left for forthcoming papers, but none of such papers seems to
be appeared. Another example is the monograph of A.N. Carv alho, J.A. Langa
and J.C. Robinson [13], which in particular treats dimension estimates, contains
a chapter devoted to delay equations, but there are no discussions concerned with
e ective dimension estimates for such equations. Thus, we consider it important
to draw attention to the following problem.
Problem 1. How to obtain e ective dimension estimates for delay equations?
A partial solution to the above problem can be given by construction of inertial
manifolds [1, 6, 15, 40]. However, the existence of an inertial manifold only gives
an integer estimate given by its dimension and such an estimate is too rough
to apply , for example, some criteria of non-existence of periodic orbits based on
dimension estimates (see R.A. Smith [33]; M.Y. Li and J.S. Muldowney [27]). Such
criteria can be mixed with v arious developments of the Poincar  e-Bendixson theory
for in nite-dimensional dynamical systems (see [1, 30]) to obtain convergence
properties. On the other hand, the existence of smooth inertial manifolds at
least theoretically leads to a certain ODE given by a smooth vector  eld (the so-
called inertial form), which describes dynamics on the manifold. The linearized
vector  eld can be symmetrized to obtain e ective dimension estimates. T o the
best of our knowledge, the only case, to which this approach can be e ciently
applied, is given by delay equations with small delays, for which C. Chicone in
[15] obtained an expansion for the vector  eld by the delay v alue considered as a
Electronic Journal. h ttp://di journal.spbu.ru/ 18Di er ential Equations and Contr ol Pr o c esses, N. 4, 2022
small parameter.
Note that in the case of ODEs there is an e ective approach called the Leonov
method (see N.V. Kuznetsov [25]; G.A. Leonov et al. [26]; N.V. Kuznetsov
and V. Reitmann [24]) concerned with changes of the metric tensor via special
Lyapunov-like functions. Sometimes it allows to obtain sharp (or even exact [26])
estimates for the Lyapunov dimension (and, consequently , for the Hausdor  and
fractal dimensions) on the global attractor. T o the best of our knowledge, there
is still no e cient applications of the Leonov method for in nite-dimensional sys-
tems. Its development with the synthesis of the above mentioned criteria for the
nonexistence of periodic orbits [33, 27] has particular interest.
Let A: D(A) ⊂ H → H be a closed linear operator. Let L ⊂ D (A) be a
 nite dimensional subspace and Π L
be the orthogonal (in H) pro jector onto L.
The tr ac e of A onL is the v alue Tr(A◦ Π L
). Let us de ne the tr ac e numb ers

eigenv alues of a self-adjoint extension S of the symmetrized operator S
0
:=(A+
A
∗ )/2. In the case of delay equations such operators as S are de ned everywhere
inH and have null spaces of  nite codimension. By considering some simplest
cases, one can see that the trace numbers do not depend on the delay v alue and
their sum can never be negative that makes them inappropriate for studying delay
equations.
Let us illustrate the problem by means of the following example. W e consider
for α ∈(0,1) and τ > 0 the operator A inH=R× L

(− τ, 0;R) given by
(x,ϕ )7→

(− τ, 0;R) and
ϕ (0)=x. Such an operator arises in the example from Section 4.

(A).
In the case k = 2 let us observe that the orthonormal basis e

(assuming also that ϕ 1
(− τ ) = 0), which shows that it is, in fact, equal to (3+
α 2
)/2. Thus, β 2
(A)=0.
If k ≥ 2 then we can choose the orthonormal basis e

k
in such a way
that ϕ i
(0) = 0 for i = 1,...,k− 1. F rom similar as above arguments we have
that β k
(A)=0 for k≥ 2.
Although for A being self-adjoint, the supremum in (3.22) is achieved on some
eigenspace, it can be seen from the proof of Lemma 3.4 that for the operators
corresponding to delay equations the supremum in (3.22) is not achieved on any
nice subspace and the limiting subspace consists of discontinuous functions.
R emark 6. Below, we prove Theorem 7, which shows that  the limiting subspace 
is an eigenspace for a self-adjoint extension of the symmetrized operator S

:=

(A+A
∗ )/2. Let us illustrate this for A from Lemma 3.4. In this case S
0
can be
extended to a bounded self-adjoint operator S inH given by
(x,ϕ )7→
 
3+α 2
2
x,0
 
for all (x,ϕ )∈H. (3.27)
It is clear that the trace numbers β k
(A) calculated in Lemma 3.4 coincide with
the eigenv alues of S ordered by non-increasing.
Note also that there are two leading real eigenv alues λ 1
>0 andλ 2
<0 of the
operatorA given by (3.23) (see Section 4). F rom the dichotomy of linear problems
for delay equations we have that the inequality λ 1
+λ 2
<0 determines a region in
the space of parameters (τ,α ) where two-dimensional volumes are squeezed. But
it seems impossible to reveal this region from the trace formula (3.20) without
directly referring to the spectral decomposition.
Thus, it seems that the trace numbers β k
(A), which are useful for studying
parabolic problems and ODEs, are not appropriate for delay equations.
W e  nish this section by proving the following theorem.
Theorem 7. L et a close d op er ator A b e such that D(A)∩D(A

(S) c an b e or der e d by non-
incr e asing. Then for any k =1,2,... we have β k
(A)=α k
(S).
Pr o of. F or breviety , let (·,·) denote the inner product in H. Let us  rstly prove
that we have the equality
(Ae,e)=(Se,e) for all e∈D(A). (3.28)
Indeed, the equality in (3.28) holds for any e∈D(A)∩D(A
∗ ). But then we have
an analogous identity for the corresponding bilinear forms as
(Av,w)+(v,Aw)=2(Sv,w) for all v,w∈D(A)∩D(A
∗ ). (3.29)
Now take instead of v a sequence v
m
∈ D(A)∩D(A
∗ ) converging to some v ∈
D(A) inH as m→+∞. Using the equalities (Av
m

m
,w)=
(v
m
,Sw) andD(S)⊃D (A), one can show that (3.29) holds with v∈D(A) and,
as a consequence of the symmetry , w∈D(A). Now taking v =w =e∈D(A) in
(3.29) yields (3.28).

k -dimensional subspaces L⊂D (A) of the v alue Tr(A◦ Π L

(S). The proof is  nished.
It is, however, interesting, whether the sum from (3.22) can be negative for
some k in some nontrivial cases arising from delay equations. W e do not know of
any such example.
4 Example
W e consider the Suarez-Schopf model [39] for El Ni  no Southern Oscillation
(ENSO), which is given by the following scalar delay equation:
˙ x(t)=x(t)− αx (t− τ )− x
3
(t), (4.1)
where α ∈ (0,1) and τ > 0 are parameters. Let us put γ :=

˚C
R
to denote the interior of C
R
. If a semi ow in C([− τ, 0];R) is given, by ω(ϕ 0
) we
denote the ω -limit set of ϕ 0
∈C([− τ, 0];R) w. r. t. this semi ow.
Let us show that (4.1) is dissipative and generates a semi ow in C([− τ, 0];R).
This is contained in the following lemma.
Lemma 4.1. The set C
R
is p ositively invariant w. r. t. solutions of (4.1). In
p articular, (4.1) gener ates a semi ow φ
t
, t ≥ 0, in C([− τ, 0];R). Mor e over,
ω(ϕ 0
)⊂C

for al l ϕ 0
∈C([− τ, 0];R).
Pr o of. Since the closure of a positively inv ariant set is positively inv ariant and the
intersection of positively inv ariants sets is also positively inv ariant, it is su cient
to show that
˚C
R
is positively inv ariant for all R > 0. Suppose the opposite, i. e.
there exist an initial condition ϕ 0
∈
˚C
R
and a time t>0 such that for the classical
solution x(·;0,ϕ 0
) we have φ
s
(ϕ 0

R
for all s∈[0,t) and|x(t)|=γ +R.

F rom (4.1) we have
(
˙ x(t) ≤ γ +R+α (γ +R)− (γ +R)
3
<0, if x(t)=R+γ,
˙ x(t) ≥− (γ +R)− α (γ +R)+(γ +R)
3
>0, if x(t)=− (R+γ ).
(4.2)
that leads to a contradiction.
Since any solution does not leave C
R
for some R≥ 0, it remains bounded and
therefore can be extended for times up to +∞ (see Theorem 3.1, Section 2.3 in
[21]). Thus, (4.1) generates a semi ow in C([− τ, 0];R).
Now suppose there is ϕ 0
∈C([− τ, 0];R) such that ω(ϕ 0
)̸⊂C
0
. Then there is
R > 0 such that ω(ϕ 0
)⊂C
R
and ω(ϕ 0
)̸⊂C
R− ε
for all 0 < ε < R. Since ω(ϕ 0
)
cannot entirely lie on the boundary of C
R
(due to similar as in (4.2) arguments),
we can  nd 0 < ε
1
< R and ϕ 1
,ϕ 2
∈ ω(ϕ 0
) such that ϕ 1
∈ C
R− ε
1
and ϕ 2
∈ C
R
with∥ϕ 2
∥=γ +R. Then there is a time moment t
0
>0 for which φ
t

(ϕ 0
) is close
to ϕ 1
, namely , φ
t
0
(ϕ 0
) ∈ C
R− ε
0
for some ε
0
< ε
1
. But since C
R− ε
0
is positively
inv ariant we have that φ
t
(ϕ 0
) is separated from ϕ 2
for all t≥ t
0
that contradicts
to ϕ 2
∈ω(ϕ 0
). Thus, ω(ϕ 0
)⊂C
0
and the proof is  nished.
It should be noted that from a theorem of J. Mallet-Paret and G.R. Sell [30]
it follows that for (4.1) the ω -limit set of any point ϕ 0
satis es the Poincar  e-
Bendixson trichotomy , i. e. it can be either a stationary point, either a periodic
orbit or a union of a set of stationary points and homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits
connecting them. However, numerical experiments in [39, 3] show that there is a
region, for which there are no periodic orbits (see below).
An elementary analysis shows that there are three stationary states ϕ +
≡ √
1− α , ϕ 0
≡ 0 and ϕ − ≡ − √
1− α . There is also a one-dimensional unsta-
ble manifold for ϕ 0
for any parameters α ∈ (0,1) and τ > 0. When α and τ are relatively small, the stationary states ϕ +
and ϕ − are asymptotically stable.
These parameters correspond to the region of linear stability in [39], for which no
periodic orbits were observed. However, in our paper [3] we numerically found
hidden and unstable periodic orbits in (4.1), arising after homoclinic bifurcations,
for parameters from the region of linear stability which are close to its boundary
(called the neutr al curve in [39]). Moreover, in [3] we justi ed that these parame-
ters (unlike the parameters from the region of linear instability) are related to the
irregular nature of ENSO since the discovered multistability is sensible to exterior
periodic forces or noise.
Since the semi ow generated by (4.1) is dissipative, there is a global attractor
K ⊂C
0
. T o make the developed theory applicable, let g:R→R be a function

which coincides with x

on [− (γ +R),γ +R] for some R >0 and it is smoothly
extended outside of [− (γ +R),γ +R] in such a way that g ∈ C
1
(R;R) and g
′
is globally bounded. Clearly , the set K will be also inv ariant for the semi ow
φ
t
generated by (4.1) with x
3
changed to g(x). As before, we consider K as a
subset ofH=R× L
2
(− τ, 0;R) andK is also inv ariant w. r. t. the corresponding
semi ow in H given by Theorem 1 which we also denote by φ.
Let v
0
∈ K, where v
0
= (y
0
,ϕ 0
). Let y(t) = x(t;0,x
0
) be the classical
solution of (4.1) with y(0) = y
0
. F or ξ ∈ D(A), where ξ = (z
0
,ϕ 0
) such that
ϕ 0
∈ W
1,2
(− τ, 0;R) and ϕ 0
(0) = z
0
, we consider the solution V(t) = V(t,v
0
,ξ )
of (3.1), which in our case can be described as a solution to
˙ z(t)=z(t)− αz (t− τ )− 3y
2
(t)z(t),
˙
ϕ (t)=
∂
∂θ ϕ (t).
(4.3)
Here V(t)=(z(t),ϕ (t)) and V(0)=(z
0
,ϕ 0
).
Let L(t;v), where t ≥ 0 and v ∈ K, be the quasi-di erentials given by
Theorem 3 for φ
t
. It is clear that the zero stationary point ϕ 0
belongs to K.
F rom a naive look at (4.3) one may suggest that (due to the presence of the term
− 3y
2
(t)z(t)) the squeezing of d-dimensional volumes at ϕ 0
(where y(t) ≡ 0) is
the worst possible comparing with other points on the attractor K. However, the
presence of delay makes it not so obvious and we can only conjecture this (see
below).
The roots of the linear part of (4.1) are given by
1− αe
− τp
− p=0. (4.4)
It can be veri ed that if α ∈ (0,1) and τ > 0 then there are always one positive
real root λ 1
, one negative real root λ 2
and the others roots are located to the
left from λ 2
. F rom the dichotomy of autonomous linear systems (see Theorem
4.1, Chapter 7 in [21]) it follows that λ 1
+λ 2
< 0 indicates the squeezing of 2-
dimensional volumes at the zero stationary state ϕ 0
. F rom the above observ ations
we pose the following problem.
Problem 2. Let λ 1
= λ 1
(α,τ ) and λ 2
= λ 2
(α,τ ), where α ∈ (0,1) and τ > 0,
be the positive and the negative real roots of (4.4). Is it true that the condition
λ 1
+λ 2
<0 excludes the presence of periodic orbits and homoclinics in (4.1)?

+λ 2
<0 is equiv alent to
τ <

√

. (4.5)
Electronic Journal. h ttp://di journal.spbu.ru/ 24Di er ential Equations and Contr ol Pr o c esses, N. 4, 2022
The inequality λ 1
+λ 2
<0 indicates a large region in the space of parameters
(α,τ ), which is included (but strictly smaller) in the region of linear stability
from [39] (see Fig. 1). When λ 1
+λ 2
> 0, there may exist periodic orbits and
homoclinics as it is indicated in [3]. However, the region λ 1
+λ 2
<0 is contained
(but strictly smaller) in the region of true stability (with a gradient-like behavior)
numerically obtained in [3]. Thus, [3] provides numerical evidence that the answer
to Problem 2 should be positive.
At the end of Section 3 we justi ed that straightforward applications of the
Liouville trace formula (3.20) are not appropriate to study delay equations.
Let us present another viewpoint onto the above problem. F or this we consider
the 2nd compound cocycle, say Ξ (2)
= {Ξ t
(2)
(q,·)}, where t ≥ 0 and q ∈ K,
associated with (4.3). This cocycle Ξ (2)
acts in the 2-nd exterior power

E for ξ 1
,ξ 2
∈ E. Note that Λ 2
E
can be identi ed with the anti-symmetric functions in C([− τ, 0]
2
) (see [29] for
details). Let us consider the largest uniform Lyapunov exponent of Ξ (2)
over K
given by

. This can be done via the v ariational
principle for subadditive functions as in the following theorem.

Let µ be an ergodic Borel measure for f on K. Since recurrent points lying
in the support of any Borel inv ariant measure are typical (see item 1, Proposition
4.1.18 in [22]), the support of µ must contain stationary or periodic points of the
semi ow φ due to the Poincar  e-Bendixson trichotomy (Theorem 2.1 in [30]).
By Lemma 2.3.5 in [41], one can take µ such that b
1
is realized as a Lyapunov
exponent for µ . Let q
0
=ϕ 0
be any stationary or periodic point in the support at
which the Lyapunov exponent exists. Without loss of generality , we may assume
that q
0
is σ -periodic for some σ > 0. If µ 1
and µ 2
are the  rst two Floquet
multipliers (their existence is guaranteed by Theorem 5.1 in [29]), then σb
1
≤ ln|µ 1
µ 2
|. But it is clear that σ ln|µ 1
µ 2
|≤ b

Thus, Theorem 8 reduces Problem 2 to that any periodic orbit must be asymp-
totically stable (in the sense |µ 1

for the region containing the global attractor K for certain parameters.

There are only two possible cases (when one of the strict inequalities is violated).

Now the  nal statement about the global attractor can be shown analogously
to the corresponding part of Lemma 4.1.
Now we use the obtained in Theorem 4.2 sharper bounds for the global at-
tractor K to get the nonexistence of periodic orbits and homoclincs for certain
parameters.

Pr o of. Indeed, (4.27) and (4.10) imply that for any periodic orbit the  rst two
Floquet multipliers satisfy |µ 1
µ 2
|<1. Note that ατ < 1/2 implies that λ 1
+λ 2
<
0 for the roots of (4.4) and that ϕ +
and ϕ − are asymptotically stable. Thus,
Theorem 8 implies that b
1
<0 and we have the uniform decay for two-dimensional
volumes over the global attractor K in the sense of (4.7).
Due to the smoothing estimate in (ULIP) from Theorem 1, one can show
that an analog of (4.7) holds also in the norm of H and from (3.21) we get that
(3.19) is satis ed for d=2 and su ciently large t>0. F rom Theorem 5 it follows
that dim
F
K < 2. Then Corollary 2 from [27] implies that there are no periodic
orbits or homoclinics in K. Now the Poincar  e-Bendixson trichotomy (Theorem
2.1 in [30]) guarantees that the ω -limit set of any point must be a single stationary
point. The proof is  nished.
Fig. 1 shows the region determined by (4.27), however it is much smaller than

F orv∈E andt≥ 0 let us de ne ψ t
(v,ξ ):=L(t,v)ξ , whereL(t,v)ξ , as in Section

[21], we immediately have the following lemma.
Lemma 5.1. L et F ∈ C

Now letA⊂ E be an inv ariant w. r. t. the semi ow φ from Section 3  nite-
dimensional topological manifold such that the semi ow is invertible on A and,
consequently , in virtue of the Brouwer theorem on inv ariance of domain, it de nes
a  ow on A. W e also put ϑ
t
(v) := φ
t
 
 
A
(v) for t∈R, v ∈A and Q :=A. Then
(Q,ϑ) is a  ow. It is obvious that we have the cocycle property satis ed as
ψ t+s
(v,ξ )=ψ t
(ϑ
s
(v),ψ s
(v,ξ )), for all t,s≥ 0,v∈A,ξ ∈E. (5.1)
F rom this and Lemma 5.1 it follows that ψ is a cocycle in E over the base  ow
ϑ=φ inQ=A. This allows us to apply results from Appendix A.
Now we suppose that F ∈ C
1
with F
′
globally bounded and the semi-
 ow φ (the same as in Section 3) satis es conditions (H1),(H2) and (H3)
from Appendix A, i. e. there exists an operator P ∈ L(E;E

Theorem (see [2] for a proof and detailed discussions which especially concern
delay equations).
R emark 10. In this section we discuss inertial manifolds in the classical phase
space E (of course, we can work directly in H). However, it seems crucial (at
least from the point of view given by the F requency Theorem [2]) to consider the
weaker norm |·|
H
in the right-hand side of (5.2).
W e will use the V -orthogonal pro jector Π: E → E
− de ned by Pv := v
− .
F rom Theorem 1 we have properties (ULIP) and (COM) satis ed for φ and
thus we may apply Theorem A.1 to get an inv ariant j -dimensional topological
manifold A ⊂ E, on which the semi ow is invertible
  . Our aim is to show that
we may pass to the limit in (5.2) to get the corresponding inequality for the
cocycle (ψ,ϑ ) given by the linearization of φ onA. Below we always assume that
F ∈C

) and F

is globally bounded.

v

and take it to the limit as h → 0 to get (5.3).
Such a passage is justi ed by Theorem 2.
R emark 11. In fact, the restriction r≥ τ for (5.3) is unnecessary if we use di er-
entiability results for φ
t
inE (see Theorem 4.1, Section 2.4 in [21]).
  This follo ws from the fact that an amenable tra jectory passing through a giv en p oin t on A is unique [6, 1].
Note that the con tin uit y of the in v erse to φ

can b e also sho wn without an y app ealing to the Brou w er theorem
on in v ariance of domain. Ho w ev er, our construction of A highly relies on this theorem.

Thus, the cocycle ψ , which is obtained through the linearization of φ on A,
also satis es the hypotheses of Theorem A.1, which gives us a family of amenable
sets for v ∈ A, which we denote by A
′
(v). Clearly , A
′
(v) is a j -dimensional
subspace ofE. Let us consider the maps Φ: E

e
Φ: A× E
− →E, where
Φ(Π v) = v for all v∈A and
e
Φ( v,Π ξ ) = ξ for all v∈A and ξ ∈A
′
(v). Clearly ,
e
Φ( v,ζ ) is linear in ζ so we will usually write
e
Φ( v)ζ instead of
e
Φ( v,ζ ). One should
think of A
′
(v) as a tangent space to A at v and think of
e
Φ( v) as the di erential
of Φ at ζ = Π v . W e shall not give a proof of this, referring the interested reader
to [1]. F rom this one can obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 11. L et the semi ow φ satisfy (H1),(H2) and (H3) as in (5.2). Then
Φ: E
− →E is C
1
-di er entiable and Φ ′
(ζ ) =
e
Φ(Φ( ζ )) for al l ζ ∈E
− . Mor e over,
A is a C
1
-di er entiable submanifold in E; its tangent sp ac e at any p oint v∈A is
given by A
′
(v); the  ow φ onA is C
1
-smo oth and the di er ential of φ
t
at v∈A
is given by the map L(t;v):A
′
(v)→A
′
(φ
t
(v)) for al l t∈R.
It is known thatC
1
-di erentiability of A is the maximum that one may achieve
under the classical Spectral Gap Condition (which is included in our theory as it
is shown in [4]) for semilinear parabolic equations and to obtain the di erentia-
bility of higher orders one needs a more restrictive condition (see S.-N. Chow and
G.R. Sell [16]; R. Rosa and R. T emam [32]). Results in the theory of normally
hyperbolic manifolds (see, for example, N. F enichel [20]) suggests that A will be
C
k
-smooth if (H3) is satis ed for two parameters ν 2
> ν 1
(with possibly di er-
ent constants, operators and spaces, but with the same j ) such that ν 2
/ν
1
> k .
However, such large spectral gaps are rarely seen in nonlocal applications of the
theory .
F or the normal hyperbolicity of A it is necessary to require the following
property .
(HYP) There exists 0 < ν ′
< ν such that the semi ow φ satis es (H1) with
a possibly di erent operator P , (H2) with the same j and (H3) with ν changed to ν ′
and possibly di erent constants δ and τ V
.
This property is satis ed in applications, where conditions for the existence of P
are given by strict inequalities so we can always v ary ν a bit (see Section 6).
In [1] it is shown that the submanifold A has the so-called exponential tracking
property (and the exponent of attraction is nothing more than ν from (H3))
and it is normally hyperbolic under (HYP). This, in particular, answers the
questions of R.A. Smith [34] on the di erentiability and normal hyperbolicity

F rom the V -orthogonal pro jector Π we obtain a chart on A. However, to
study coordinate representation of the vector  eld on A (i.e. inertial forms) it
is convenient to use other charts on A. Namely , under (H3) we call a bounded
pro jector Π a
inE admissible if for any nonzero v ∈ RanΠ a
we have V(v) < 0
and for any nonzero v ∈ KerΠ a
we have V(v) > 0. Under the conditions of
Theorem 11 it turns out that Π a
: A → RanΠ a
is also a homeomorphism and
Π a

is an isomorphism for any v ∈ A. Consequently , due to
the C

di erentiable and globally Lipschitz. Moreover, transition maps between such
admissible charts are globally Lipschitz and C

Pr o of. The main obstacle to study the vector  eld f in (5.7) is due to fact that
the V -orthogonal pro jector Π has nothing to do with the operators A and B and,
consequently , the di erentiability properties of f are not obvious in the chart
given by Π . Due to this, it is convenient to use di erent charts on A given by
other pro jectors.
By the hypothesis, there exists a spectral pro jector Π a
for A which is ad-
missible. Note that such a pro jector can be de ned everywhere in H (since A
is an operator in H) and commutes with A. Thus, Π a
A = AΠ a
and Π a
B are
bounded linear maps and in the chart given by Π a
the conclusions of Lemma 5.3
are obvious. Then the arguments before lemma show that the same holds in any
admissible chart and, in particular, the one given by the V -orthogonal pro jector
Π .
The following theorem is a generalization of Corollary 2.2 from [33], where
the case of ODEs in R

estimate the product of the  rst l < j singular v alues through the product of
all j singular v alues, which, in turn, can be estimated through the trace that is
independent of metric changes.

6 Example (continued)
Let us consider again the Suarez-Schopf model (4.1). Here we will provide con-
ditions for the existence of one-dimensional and two-dimensional inertial mani-
folds in the model. These manifolds are actually perturbations of the eigenspaces
corresponding to the leading characteristic roots λ 1
and λ 2
at the zero equilib-
rium ϕ 0
. Conditions for persistence of such eigenspaces are given in terms of
the so-called transfer function of the linear part (see [2]) and take the form of
an inequality (called frequency inequality), which generalizes the Spectral Gap
Condition [4]. In the case of (4.1) written in the form (1.5) the transfer function

Theorem 13. Supp ose that ατ < 1/2 and for some ν ∈ (0,− λ 2

is satis e d. Then the glob al attr actor K of (4.1) is c ontaine d in a one-dimensional
C

The proof is standard: we truncate
**
the nonlinearity x

outside a small
neighborhood of K and study the modi ed equation. F rom (6.2) we can apply
   the F requency Theorem from [2] to get a proper operator P as in Section 5. Then
we can construct an inertial manifold for the modi ed system, which contains K
by de nition (since ν > 0, see Appendix (A)) by methods of [1]. Restricting the
manifold to the small neighborhood of K gives the desired manifold.
Thus, under the conditions of Theorem 13, K is just the union of equilibria
and the unstable manifold of ϕ 0
.
Numerical simulations in [3] show that the global attractor K for a wide range
of parameters of interest lies in the ball of radius 1. Let λ 3
and λ 4
be the  rst
pair of complex-conjugate roots of (4.4).

Fig. 2 shows a region where the conditions of Theorem 13 or Theorem 14 are
satis ed. Note that a part of the blue region can be obtained also using the rough
estimate
√
1+α from Lemma 4.1 to bound the global attractor K. This allows to
rigorously justify the existence of two-dimensional inertial manifolds containing
K. However, this part does not contain interesting parameters from [3], for which
periodic orbits can be observed. W e expect that the relative simplicity of the
Suarez-Schopf model may allow to construct sharper regions and, consequently ,
rigorously justify the existence of inertial manifolds for the interesting parameters.

Let A(q) be the set of all amenable tra jectories at q . A generalization of

A proof can be given following the same arguments as in [6] and using the
above given remarks. A proof for the more general case, where P and ν depends
on q ∈ Q, is presented in our adjacent work [1]. Note that we also considered
a number τ V
≥ 0 in (H1) (in [6] there was no such a number), which may be
convenient sometimes. Convergence theorems for periodic cocycles given in [6] can
be also generalized to this setting (see [1]). Along with the F requency Theorem
from [2], which covers delay equations and allows to construct operators as in
(H3), this satisfactorily solves Problem 2 from [6].

Now suppose that Φ( q

(0) does not converge in E to v(0) = Φ( q,ζ ).
Then for a subsequence (we keep the same index) we have that |v

E
is
separated from zero. Let us for every k consider the integral in (A.7) on segments
[l− 1,l], where l =− 1,− 2,.... Using the mean v alue theorem, we get a family of
numbers t
(l)
k
∈[l− 1,l] such that vectors v
k
(t
(l)
k
) are bounded inE uniformly in k
and the bound depends on l. T aking a subsequence, if necessary , we may assume
that t
(l)
k
→ t
l
as k → +∞ for some t
l
∈ [l− 1,l]. F or a  xed l let us consider
C := {ϑ
t
(l)
k
(q
k
) | k = 1,2,...} and B := {Π v
k
(t
(l)
k
) | k = 1,2,...}. Clearly , C
is precompact and B is bounded. Then v
k
(t
(l)
k
) lies in the precompact (in E)
set Φ( C,B). Thus, there exist a converging subsequence. Using Cantor’s diagonal
argument, we may assume that v
k
(t
(l)
k
) converges inE to some v
l
∈E ask→+∞
for all l = − 1,− 2,.... Let us de ne v
l
(t) := ψ t− t
l
(ϑ
t
l
(q),v
l
) for t ≥ t
l
. F rom
the continuity of the cocycle we have that v
k
(t)→ v
l
(t) as k → +∞ for t > t
l
.
This implies that v
l− 1
(t) = v
l
(t) for all l and all t > t
l
. F or any t ∈R de ne
v
∗ (t) := v
l
(t), where l such that t > t
l
. Then v
∗ (·) is a complete tra jectory at q
and v
k
(t)→v
∗ (t) inE for all t∈R. F rom (A.7) it follows that v
∗ (·) is amenable.
Since Π v
k
(0) = ζ k
→ Π v
∗ (0) and ζ k
→ ζ , we must have Π v
∗ (0) = ζ . But since
v(·) and v
∗ (·) are both amenable at q and Π: A(q)→E
− is a homeomorphism,
we must have v(·)≡ v
∗ (·) and, consequently , v
k
(0)→ v(0) inE. This leads to a
contradiction.
R emark 13. Let us discuss the conditions of Theorem A.2. Assumption (BA)
is natural in the following two cases. The  rst one is when (Q,ϑ) is a minimal
almost periodic (in the sense of Bohr)  ow. In this case this condition will be
satis ed if there is a bounded in the future semitra jectory at some q , i. e. when
the limit dynamics is nontrivial. The second case is when the cocycle is linear (as
in Section 5). Here the zero tra jectory at each q satis es the required property .
The assumption of uniform compactness for Φ is also natural. It will be satis ed
if we assume that assumptions (UCOM) and (ULIP) below hold. Thus, this
condition is also natural.
(UCOM) There exists τ ucom
> 0 such that for any precompact set C ⊂Q and
any bounded set B⊂ E the set ψ τ ucom
(C,B) is precompact inE.
Electronic Journal. h ttp://di journal.spbu.ru/ 42Di er ential Equations and Contr ol Pr o c esses, N. 4, 2022
(ULIP) There exists t
S

T

such that for all v
