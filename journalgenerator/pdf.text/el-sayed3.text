Abstract
In this paper we concern with the nonlinear functional integral inclusion in the real
line R. The existence of integrable solutions will be study under the assumptions that
the set-valued function F has L
1
-Caratheodory selection and measurable selection. We
reformulate the functional integral inclusion according to these selections and study two
cases of such problem.
Keywords : Set-valued function, integrable solution, functional integral inclu-
sion, selection of the set-valued function,L

1 Introduction
Let R denote the real line. Let I = [0;T ] and let L

(I) be the class of all
Lebesgue integrable functions de ned on the interval I, with the norm

The topic of differential and integral inclusions is of much interest in the subject
of set-valued analysis.Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2017
The existence theorems for the inclusions problems are generally obtained under
the assumptions that the set-valued function is either lower or upper semicontin-
uous on the domain of its de nitions (see [1] and [16]) and for the discontinuity
of the set-valued function (see [8]).
The integral inclusions have been studied by B.C. Dhage and D. O'Regan (see
[7] and [16]) for the existence results under Caratheodory condition of F .
Let m : [0;T ]! [0;T ] be continuous and nondecreasing function.
In this paper we study the existence of integrable solution x2 L
1
[0;T ] of the
functional integral inclusion
x(t)2F (t;
Z
t
0
g(s;x(m(s)))ds); t2 [0;T ] (1)
where F : [0;T ] R! P (R) is a nonlinear set-valued mapping and P (R)
denote the family of nonempty subsets of R under a set of several suitable as-
sumptions on the function F .
Our study is based on the selections of the set-valued function F on which
we have a functional integral equation, such a type has been studied in several
papers (see [5], [12]-[13] and [17]).
We study two approaches, the  rst approach we study the existence of inte-
grable solution x2 L
1
[0;T ] by reformulating the functional integral inclusion
(1) into a coupled system under the assumption that the set-valued function
F hasL
1
-Caratheodory selection and the second approach study the integrable
solution x2L
1
[0;T ] under the assumption that the set-valued function F has
measurable selection, .
2 Preliminaries
Now, we present some de nitions and results that will be used in this work.
De nition 1 [11] Let (T;  ) be a measurable space andX be a topological space,
a multivalued function F : T! X is measurable if for each open set A in X
the set
F
 1
(A) =ft2T :F (t)\A6= g
is measurable. (I.e. F
 1
(A)2  ).

De nition 2 [10] A set-valued function F : I  R ! P (R) is called L
1
-
Caratheodory if:
(1) t!F (t;x) is measurable in t2I for all x2R, and
(2) x!F (t;x) is upper semicontinuous in x2R for almost all t2I.
(3) There exists h2L
1
[I;R] such that
jF (t;x)j =supfjfj : f2F (t;x)g h(t)
for almost all t2I.
De nition 3 [10] A single-valued function f : I  R ! R is called L
1
-
Caratheodory if:
(1) t!f(t;x) is measurable in t2I for all x2R, and
(2) x!f(t;x) is continuous in x2R for almost all t2I.
(3) There exists h2L
1
[I;R] such that
jf(t;x)j h(t)
for almost all t2I.
De nition 4 [10] The set
S
1
F (:;x(:))
=ff2L
1
(I;R) : f(t;x)2F (t;x(t)) for a:e: t2Ig
is called the set of selections of the set-valued function F that belongs to L
1
.
Theorem 1 [10] Let F :I R!P (R) be an L
1
-Caratheodory multifunction,
the set S
1
F (:;x(:))
is nonempty (i.e. there exists a selector f of F which belongs
to L
1
).
Theorem 2 [6] Let F : I R! P (R) be an multifunction. Assume that the
multifunction F satis es the following assumptions
(1) F (t;x) is nonempty, closed and convex for all (t;x)2I R,
(2) F (t;:) is lower semicontinuous from R into R,
(3) F (:;:) is measurable,
Then there exists a measurable selection for F (:;x(:)). This selection is inte-
grable if
jF (t;x)j a(t) +b(t)jxj
for each t2 (0; 1) and x2R, where a(:)2L
1
(0; 1) and b(:) is measurable and
bounded.

Let Q be a convex subset of a Banach space X; T : Q! Q be a compact,

3 Existence of integrable solution
In this section, we present our main result by proving the existence of at least
one integrable solution x2L
1
[0;T ] of the functional integral inclusion (1).
3.1 Coupled system approach
Let F :I R!R satisfy the following assumptions:
(H1) The set F (t;x) is nonempty, closed and convex for all (t;x)2I R.
(H2) F (t;:) is upper semicontinuous in x2R for each t2I.
(H3) F (:;x) is measurable in t2I for each x2R.
(H4) There exists an integrable function h(t)2L
1
[I;R] such that
jF (t;x)j =supfjfj : f2F (t;x)g h(t)
for almost all t2 [0;T ].
(H5) The functiong : [0;T ] R!R satis es Caratheodory condition, i.eg(t;:)
is continuous inx2R for eacht2I andg(:;x) is measurable int2I for each
x2R.
(H6)There exists an integrable function a2 L
1
[I;R] and a positive constant
b> 0 such that
jg(t;x)j ja(t)j +bjxj; 8 t2I; x2R:
(H7) There exists   > 0 such that m
0
(t)> , for every t2I.
For the application of these assumptions (see [2], [4], [6], [9] and [15]).

Now, let
y(t) =

g(s;x(m(s)))ds; t2 [0;T ]:
Then the nonlinear functional integral inclusion (1) can written in the form of
the coupled system of functional inclusion and functional integral equation.

De nition 5 LetX be the class of all ordered pairs (u;v); u;v2C[I;R]; with
the normk(u;v)k
X
=kuk +kvk.
De nition 6 By a solution of the coupled system (2), (3) we mean the func-
tions x;y2L
1
[0;T ] satisfying (2), (3).
Now for the existence of integrable solution U = (x;y); x;y2 L
1
[0;T ] of the
coupled system (2), (3) we have the following theorem.
Theorem 5 Let the assumptions (H1)-(H7) be satis ed. Then there exists at
least one integrable solution U = (x;y); x;y2 L
1
[0;T ] of the coupled system
(2), (3).
Proof. Let the set-valued function F satisfy the assumptions (H1)-(H4), then
from Theorem 2.1, we deduce that there exists a selectionf2F , this selection
is L
1
-Caratheodory,
i.e. f satisfy the following assumptions:
(I) f(t;:) is continuous in x2R for each t2I.
(II) f(:;x) is measurable in t2I for each x2R.
(III) There exists an integrable function h(t)2L
1
[I;R] such that
jf(t;x)j h(t)
for almost all t2 [0;T ].
And
x(t) =f(t;y(t)); t2 [0;T ] (4)
Now consider the coupled system (3), (4).
Let

Now, let us observe that the assumptions (I)-(III) imply that A

is continuous
on the set Q

is
continuous on the set Q

(see [4] and [15]).
Hence we deduce that the operator A is continuous on Q
r
.
Finally, we will show thatA is compact, to prove this we will apply Kolmogorov
compactness criterion.
Let

Hence, there exists at least one integrable solution of the functional integral
inclusion (1).
3.2 Functional integral inclusion approach
Consider now the functional integral inclusion (1) under the assumptions (H5)-
(H7) and the following assumptions
(I) The set F (t;x) is nonempty, closed and convex for all (t;x)2I R,
(II) F (t;:) is lower semicontinuous from R into R,
(III) F (:;:) is measurable in t2I for each x2R.
(IV) There exists an integrable real function a

[I;R] and a measurable
bounded function b

, such that
jF (t;x)j ja

De nition 7 By a solution of the functional integral inclusion (1) we mean
the function x(:)2L
1
[0;T ] satisfying (1).
Now for the existence of integrable solution x2L
1
[0;T ] of the functional inte-
gral inclusion (1) we have the following theorem.
Theorem 6 Let the assumptions (I)-(IV) and (H5)-(H7) be satis ed, then
there exists at least one integrable solution x2 L
1
[0;T ] of the functional in-
tegral inclusion (1).
Proof. Let the set-valued function F satisfy the assumptions (I)-(IV), then
from theorem 2.2, we deduce that there exists a selectionf2F; f :I R!R,
which satis es:
(i) f(t;:) is continuous in x2R for each t2I.
(ii) f(:;x) is measurable in t2I for each x2R.
(iii) There exists an integrable real function a

Therefore, by theorem 2.3 we have that A(
) is relatively compact, that is A
is compact operator.
According to Schauder  xed point theorem, there exists at least one integrable
solution of the functional integral equation (5), hence, there exists at least one
integrable solution of the functional integral inclusion (1).
