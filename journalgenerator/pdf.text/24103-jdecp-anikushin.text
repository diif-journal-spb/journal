Abstract. We discuss the recent progress on studying volume contraction for
linear cocycles generated by delay equations obtained by the authors. On the ba-
sis, we use adapted metrics constructed explicitly or via the Frequency Theorem.
In contrast to many existing results, this approach allows to provide effective es-
timates in terms of the system parameters (including delays). We illustrate the
exposed general results by means of the nonautonomous and classical Nicholson
blowflies models, where effective dimension estimates for global attractors and
robust conditions for the global stability are obtained.

1 Introduction
Estimating dimensions of global attractors is one of basic problems in dissipa-
tive dynamics. Although the initial interest in the problem was concerned with
finite-dimensional reduction (see S. Zelik [45]), further developments revealed a
natural generalization of the Bendixson criterion and its applications to the prob-
lem of global stability (see R. Smith [41]; M.Y. Li and J.S. Muldowney [34, 35];
G.A. Leonov and V.A. Boichenko [33]). From this perspective, the problem of
effective computation or estimation of dimensions is of high interest. In this di-
rection, the main approach is concerned with the study of volume contraction and
the related dimensional-like characteristic called the Lyapunov dimension. In [1],
it is shown that the Lyapunov dimension theoretically admits exact computation
via adapted metrics on exterior products. Although many authors use standard
metrics to provide effective estimates (mainly in the case of ODEs and parabolic
equations; see R. Temam [44]), sharper estimates or even exact computations re-
quire considerations of adapted metrics (see N.V. Kuznetsov and V. Reitmann
[25]). This is also the case for some problems in which standard metrics are not
appropriate.
This work is a survey devoted to the problem of providing effective dimension
estimates for delay equations. On the geometric level, the problem is concerned
with studying volume contraction for linear cocycles generated by linearized delay
equations. It was clearly posed in the work of the first author [6] based on the
analysis of preceding results.
Among them, it should be highlighted the pioneering work of J. Mallet-Paret
[40] which utilizes compactness of the cocycle mappings to establish finiteness of
dimensions. This method does not provide any way to obtain effective estimates.
Starting from [40], most of the works interested in delay equations and dimension
estimates follow similar approaches therefore making only qualitative conclusions
on the finiteness of dimensions. This is reflected in the classical monographs
(for example, J.K. Hale [20]) as well as in relatively recent ones (see A.N. Car-
valho, J.A. Langa and J.C. Robinson [13]; I.D. Chueshov [17]). Moreover, even
recent works, for example of W. Hu and T. Caraballo [22], proceed to develop
this approach. In [22], the resulting estimates are called explicit, but they are not
effective because of appealing to objects associated with exponential dichotomies
of non-self-adjoint linear problems which cannot be computed or analyzed effec-
tively. In addition, the utilization of exponential dichotomies for the problem of
dimension estimates is artificial and therefore it results in estimates with wrong

asymptotics.
It is well-known that one of general ways to provide effective dimension esti-
mates is concerned with the Liouville trace formula and resulting from it upper
estimates such as the Douady-Oesterl´ e or Constantin-Foias-Temam estimate (see
N.V. Kuznetsov V. Reitmann [25]; R. Temam [44]; S. Zelik [45]). To the best of
our knowledge, the first attempt to apply this approach for delay equations was
done by J.W-H. So and J. Wu in [43]. However, the authors did not succeed to de-
rive from it effective estimates. In particular, at the end of the introduction they
wrote: “The verification of the hypotheses in Theorem 3.10 for reaction-diffusion
systems with delays is a non-trivial task and will be reported in a future paper.”
Since then, none of such declared results appeared.
A reason for such a failure is explained in [6] by means of a simpler example.
Namely, to derive from the Liouville formula some uniform upper estimates, one
has to compute or estimate the so-called trace numbers. For the computation,
one applies the symmetrization procedure which sometimes allows to describe the
trace numbers via eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators obtained via the additive
symmetrization
∗
(see [1]). In [6], for particular delay operators, it is shown that
the trace numbers computed in the standard metric are irrelevant (in particular,
they do not depend on the delay). Moreover, for general delay operators, the sym-
metrization procedure itself requires additional justification and the false proof
(and the false general statement) of Theorem 7 in [6] only confirms this.
In [1], the general symmetrization problem is stated and its investigation is
illustrated by means of a fairly general class of delay operators. In particular, it
is shown that the resolution of the problem significantly depends on the choice of
a metric from the considered class. Moreover, the study allowed to obtain for the
first time effective dimension estimates for global attractors in the Mackey-Glass
equations and the periodically forced Suarez-Schopf delayed oscillator [5] and the
estimates are numerically justified to be asymptotically sharp as the delay tends
to infinity. In Section 3, we will discuss some of these results in more details.
As to [43], the authors exclude discrete delays from consideration due to their
inability to construct semigroups in Hilbert spaces (this problem was resolved in
[6]) and consider only distributed delays. Note that such delays may cause the
presence of a continuous spectrum in the additive symmetrization and how to
∗
For parabolic equations, the symmetrization procedure is trivial and it is usually used implicitly. In the
case of reaction-diffusion systems, upper estimates for the trace numbers in standard metrics lead to relevant
asymptotics of dimensions [44]. To provide sharper estimates or to study other parabolic equations such as the
2D Navier-Stokes equations, one has to develop additional techniques, for example, the theory of Lieb-Thirring
inequalities (see V.V. Chepyzhov and A.A. Ilyin [14]).
https://doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu35.2024.103 Electronic Journal: http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 24Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 1, 2024
deal with this is still an open problem (see [1]).
Another approach to provide effective dimension estimates for delay equations
is developed by the first author in [2]. It is based on applications of the recently
obtained version of the Frequency Theorem [4] (see also [8]) to study m-fold
compound cocycles acting on exterior powers of the Hilbert space. For this,
it is required to study their infinitesimal generators along with structural and
regularity properties of the associated linear inhomogeneous problems and most of
the study [2] is devoted to this. As a result, we obtain frequency conditions for the
exponentialstabilityofm-foldcompoundcocycles. Geometrically, suchconditions
imply the existence of a constant adapted metric (on the exterior power) which
allows to establish the exponential stability.
In [3], the authors developed an approximation scheme to verify some of the
arising(intheabovestudy)frequencyinequalitiesforthecaseofscalarequations
†
.
For m = 2, such conditions (called the Frequency Criterion) are expected to
imply global stability in the system due to the generalized Bendixson criterion of
M.Y. Li and J.S. Muldowney [35] and robustness of the Frequency Criterion. We
will discuss this in Section 4 and illustrate the criterion by means of the classical
Nicholson blowflies model in Section 6.
Among preceding works it should be also mentioned the study of J. Mallet-
Paret and R.D. Nussbaum [38] concerned with cocycles on injective tensor prod-
ucts generated by a class of scalar delay equations arising after linearization of
scalar nonlinear equations with monotone feedback. Such nonlinear equations
are known to satisfy the Poincar´ e-Bendixson trichotomy (see J. Mallet-Paret and
G.R. Sell [39]). In [38], it is established a comparison principle which allows to
compare the Floquet multipliers over periodic orbits and stationary points (con-
sidered as periodic with the same period). In [6], this principle is combined with
the Ergodic Variational Principle (see [1]) to derive effective dimension estimates
‡
.
However, systems of equations or scalar equations without monotone feedback go
beyond this context.
Moreover, effective dimension estimates for delay equations can be obtained
in the case of small delays by studying vector fields in R
n
. This is possible due
to the existence of inertial manifolds for such equations (see [4]). In [15, 16],
C. Chicone obtained a power series expansion of the vector field on the inertial
manifold in terms of the small delay. This series can be used to symmetrize the
vector field and provide effective dimension estimates.
†
The general scheme works for systems of equations.
‡
In [5] it is shown that the Frequency Criterion may improve these estimates.

There are results on fractal dimensions of forced almost periodic oscillations
obtained by the first author [10] and the authors joint with V. Reitmann [11]
for almost periodic ODEs which are interesting to generalize for delay equations.
Here a problem arises due to the fact that quadratic functionals constructed by
the Frequency Theorem [4] may be not coercive.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss well-posedness
and linearization for a class of nonautonomous nonlinear delay equations in R
n
posed in a proper Hilbert space H. In Section 3, we consider effective dimen-
sion estimates via additive symmetrization of delay operators. In Section 4, we
state a frequency criterion guaranteeing volume contraction for m-fold compound
cocycles and expose a numerical scheme for its verification in the case m = 2.
In Section 5, we obtain effective dimension estimates for global attractors in the
nonautonomous Nicholson blowflies model. In Section 6, we apply the Frequency
Criterion to provide robust conditions for the global stability in the classical
Nicholson blowflies model and compare the result with other methods.

Hilbert spaces
In this section, we are going to discuss the well-posedness and linearization of the
following nonautonomous nonlinear delay equations over a semiflow (Q,ϑ) on a

for ϕ ∈E. It will be convenient to identify the elements ofE and their images in
H under the embedding and keep the same notations for the induced operators.
For example, we put C(x,ϕ ):=Cϕ for (x,ϕ )∈E for the operator induced by C
from (2.1).
With
e
B from (2.1) we associate a bounded linear operator B:U→H given
by Bη := (
e
Bη, 0) for η ∈U. Moreover, let W: Q →H be associated with
f
W
from (2.1) as W(q) := (
f

abstract nonautonomous evolution equation inH over the semiflow (Q,ϑ) which
is described by

Note that A is the generator of a C

in [6], for any v

(0,T;M) (see [2, 4, 6]). From the variation of constants
formula (2.6), one can show that the mappings
ψ t

0
) for t≥ 0,q∈Q and v
0
∈H (2.7)
determine a nonlinear cocycle ψ inH over the semiflow (Q,ϑ) (see [1, 2, 3] for
precise definitions).
§
From what has been said, we have that (2.5) is an abstract form of the transfer equation
∂
∂t
ϕ (t,θ ) =
∂
∂θ ϕ (t,θ ), wheret>0 andθ ∈(− τ, 0), and (2.1) describes a nonlinear nonlocal boundary condition of Neumann
type at θ =0.

One can relate the generalized solutions to the classical solutions in E =
C([− τ, 0];R
n
) as follows. Remind thatE is identified with its image in H under
the embedding ϕ 7→(ϕ (0),ϕ ) forϕ ∈E. By Theorem 1 in [6], the restriction of ψ toE is the cocycle inE generated by classical solutions (see J.K. Hale [20]). More
precisely, we have ψ t
(q,v
0
)=(x(0),x
t
) for t≥ 0, where x(·): [− τ, +∞)→R
n
is
continuous and C

-differentiable on [0,∞) function satisfying (2.1) for t≥ 0 and
x(θ ) =ϕ 0
(θ ) for θ ∈ [− τ, 0], where v
0
= (ϕ (0),ϕ 0
). Moreover, ψ τ (q,H)⊂ E and
for any T ≥ τ there exists a constant L

>0 such that the smoothing estimate

for t∈[τ,T ] (2.8)
is valid for any v

,v

∈H and q∈Q.
With such ψ , we can associate a skew-product semiflow π inQ× H as
π t
(q,v)=(ϑ
t
(q),ψ t
(q,v)) for t≥ 0,q∈Q and v∈H. (2.9)
From the smoothing property we have that any strictly invariant subset P ⊂ Q× H of π , i.e. such that π t
(P)=P for any t≥ 0, must satisfyP ⊂Q× E.
We may linearize (2.5) in the fiber q∈Q along the trajectory of v

simplicity), as

determine a uniformly continuous linear cocycle (in the terminology of [1, 2]) Ξ in
H over the skew-product semiflow (Q× E,π ). Analogously to (2.8), the cocycle is
smoothing in the sense that Ξ τ (℘,H)⊂ E and for any T ≥ τ there is a constant

where ℘ = (q,v

particular, it is naturally defined on the same domain D(A) being the generator
of a C

Thus an additive symmetrization of A(℘) is unique in this case.

the additive symmetrization is proper in terms of [1]. This allows to characterize
trace numbers of A(℘) via eigenvalues of the additive symmetrization. From this,
the Liouville trace formula can be applied to derive effective dimension estimates.
We are going to describe this result.
As a model forA(℘), let us consider an operator

It is convenient to put τ 0

Let∆ j

any j ∈ {1,...,J}. Moreover, to admit a proper additive symmetrization we
must satisfy ∆ j

Here the presence of a Lyapunov-like function V(·) in (3.7) is a development
of the Leonov method (see N.V. Kuznetsov [27]; N.V. Kuznetsov et al. [26];
G.A. Leonov and V.A. Boichenko [33]). On the geometric level, it is concerned
with variations of a constant metric inH in its conformal class via the Lyapunov
function. This method led to exact formulas of the Lyapunov dimension for
the H´ enon and Lorenz-like systems (see G.A. Leonov [29, 32]; G.A. Leonov et
al. [28]; G.A. Leonov and T. Mokaev [30]; G.A. Leonov, T.A. Alexeeva and

particular structure.
From (3.6) with V ≡ 0 it is clear that if we take κ
0
> 0, then α +
(m)
is negative for all sufficiently large m provided that the eigenvalues λ k
(℘) are
bounded from above onP (for example, whenP is compact).
In [1], Theorem 1 is applied to provide effective dimension estimates for global
attractors in the Mackey-Glass equations and periodically forced Suarez-Schopf
delayed oscillator (see [5]). Both models are known to be chaotic for certain pa-
rameters and this is the first time when effective dimension estimates for chaotic
attractors arising in delay equations were obtained. Moreover, the resulting esti-
mates are asymptotically sharp as the delay tends to infinity that is justified by
numerical computations of eigenvalues at equilibria. In Section 5, we will apply
Theorem 1 to the nonautonomous Nicholson blowflies model.
It is worth mentioning that the estimate (3.8) depends on the spatio-temporal
change of variables x(t) 7→ x(κt ) and ϕ (t,θ ) 7→ ϕ (κt,κθ ) for some κ > 0. Al-
though the uniform Lyapunov exponents also depend on the change (they scale
byκ ), the Lyapunov dimension does not that is clear from (2.14). In applications,
this means that we may consider a series of estimates for the Lyapunov dimension
derived from Theorem 1 which depend on κ and then minimize it over κ > 0 to
get a better result (see Corollary 3 and below for an example).
4 Frequency criterion for the global stability
In this section, we will describe another approach to obtain dimension estimates
for invariant sets arising in delay equations. It is developed by the first author
in [2] and concerned with applications of the recent version of the Frequency
Theorem [4] to study m-fold extensions Ξ m
(called compound cocycles) of the
linearization cocycle Ξ (given by (2.11)) to the exterior powerH
∧m
of the Hilbert
spaceH. In particular, these results allow to obtain frequency conditions for the
exponential stability of compound cocycles. As it is shown in [3] by means of the
Suarez-Schopf delayed oscillator and Mackey-Glass equations, at least in the case
m = 2 (related to the generalized Bendixson criterion and global stability; see
below), this approach improves results which can be obtained by Theorem 1 as
well as with the aid of some other existing methods in the field. In Section 6, we
will compare our approach with a series of works on the global stability of the
classical Nicholson blowflies model.

On the infinitesimal level, the m-fold compound cocycle is given by a per-
turbation of the m-fold additive compound A

and, consequently, dim

For autonomous systems (2.1) (i.e. whenQ is a one-point set) admitting a global
attractor, this condition allows to apply the generalized Bendixson criterion of
M.Y. Li and J.S. Muldowney [35] to exclude the existence of closed invariant
contours on the global attractor. Moreover, since (4.3) is robust in the sense that
it is preserved under small perturbations of the cocycle (see [1]), it is expected
that the system must be globally stable, i.e. any trajectory must tend to the
set of equilibria. In finite dimensions, one utilizes the C
1
-Closing Lemma of
C.C. Pugh (see [34, 41]) to obtain this. To the best of our knowledge, there are
still no variants of the lemma available in infinite dimensions and, in particular,
for delay equations. As an intermediate solution, for some delay equations one
may construct inertial manifolds (see [4, 6, 7, 9]) and apply the finite-dimensional
version of the Closing Lemma. However, we hope that our investigations will
stimulate developments of the problem in infinite dimensions.
Note that it is hard to verify (4.1) purely analytically since it requires to solve
a first-order PDE on the m-cube (− τ, 0)
m
with boundary conditions on some k-
faces (with k < m) adjacent to {0}
m
involving diagonal derivatives and delays.
Moreover, solutions to such PDEs are not usual smooth functions and have only
diagonal derivatives (see [2]).
‡‡
For convenience, here we omitted mentioning complexifications of operators.

In [3], we developed an approximation scheme to verify (4.1) in the case
of scalar equations and avoiding direct examinations of the arising PDEs. For
simplicity, we will describe it for m = 2, the system (2.10) with n = r

mations α T,N
(− ν 0
+iω) convergence uniformly in ω∈ [− Ω ,Ω] as T,N →∞ to
the norm of the transfer operator from (4.1) and they are globally Lipschitz in
ω ∈R with a uniform Lipschitz constant. Here, the parameter T can be taken
relatively small, since the corresponding to it errors decay exponentially (in an
appropriate norm) uniformly inω∈R andN asT tends to infinity. For example,
in the experiments conducted in [3], the graphs of α T,N
(− ν 0
+iω) forT =15 and
T = 25 are indistinguishable. So, the convergence of α T,N
(− ν 0
+iω) is mostly
affected by the choice of N. In the experiments from [3], it is sufficient to take
N = 10 to obtain the convergence in ω ∈ [− Ω ,Ω] for Ω = 30 and the graph
become indistinguishable with the corresponding graphs for N =20 andN =30.
Finally, the choice of Ω is related to the conjecture from [3] concerned with
that the norm of the operator from (4.1) behave as an aymptotically almost
periodic (in the sense of Bohr) function as |ω| → ∞. For practical purposes,
this means that the inequality in (4.1) can be verified in a finite interval of ω.
This conjecture is justified by the conducted experiments.
We refer to Section 6 for applications of the Frequency Criterion to the clas-
sical Nicholson blowflies model and its comparison with other methods.

where δ (·), P(·) and a(·) are continuous functions onQ satisfying

Proof. Take x(t;ϕ 0

and suppose that it exists on
some interval [− τ,t

) with t

must have x

Let

is such that x(t

(5.1) and (5.2) we have

that leads to a contradiction. Since x(t;ϕ 0
) depend continuously on ϕ 0
, from this
the conclusion of the lemma follows. The proof is finished.
Similarly to Corollary 5.1 in [1], we obtain the following.
Corollary 1. There is a dissipative skew-product semiflow π in the spaceQ×C
+
given by
π t
(q,ϕ 0
):=(ϑ

(q),x
t
) for t≥ 0,q∈Q and ϕ 0

where x(t) = x(t;ϕ 0

∈C
+
. Its global attractorA
lies inQ× (C
+
∩B
R

), where R
0
is given by (5.3).
Now let y
0
(t) = x(t;ϕ 0
) be a solution of (5.1) with ϕ 0
∈ C
+
. Then the
linearized over the corresponding trajectory equation reads as
˙ x(t)=− δ (ϑ

Thus, in terms of (3.6) for ℘=(q,ϕ 0

Note that the upper estimate in (5.10) depends on the change
∗∗∗
x(t)7→x(κt )
(with some κ > 0) in (5.1), although the Lyapunov dimension does not. Let us
derive from it the following estimate which is invariant w.r.t. such time scaling.

However, (5.15) is not the maximum that can be achieved from Theorem 2

Let us consider the autonomous version of (5.1) given by
˙ x(t)=− δx (t)+Px(t− τ )e
− ax(t− τ )
, (5.19)
with some parameters δ > 0, P > 0 and a > 0. This equation was suggested
by W.S.C. Gurney, S.P. Blythe and R.M. Nisbet [19] as a model for laboratory
insect populations studied by A.J. Nicholson and it showed a good quantitative
agreement with his results.
Although for (5.19) one is usually interested in stable periodic oscillations, the
model can demonstrate chaotic behavior. This possibility is not clearly indicated
in the literature, although in the survey of Hastings et al. [21] it is noted that
∗∗∗
In terms of (2.10) considered as a transfer equation with the boundary condition (5.1), this is not only
the change of time. More precisely, beside x(t) 7→ x(κt ) we also have ϕ (t,θ ) 7→ ϕ (κt,κθ ). So, the change is
spatio-temporal.

For P

Ξ=0 by the same reasons as above.

the original Nicholson investigations contain chaotic experimental data. On the
other hand, in [19], nonperiodic oscillations in the region of linear instability were
classified as “formally aperiodic” with a “single clearly marked dominant period”.
For (5.19), chaotic behavior can be observed, for example, for a = τ = 1,
δ =9.5 andP =250 (such parameters are included into the study from [19]). For
such parameters, using the JiTCDDE package for Python to compute Lyapunov
exponents (see G. Ansmann [12] and the repository for details), we observed the
following values
λ L
1
=0.2176± 0.0030, λ L
2
=0.0577± 0.0029,
λ L

=− 0.1554± 0.0053
λ L
5
=− 0.4462± 0.0059.
(5.20)
Thus, there are two positive Lyapunov exponents.
Moreover, for the above parameters, (5.15) gives the estimate dim
L
Ξ ≤ 883.821 and (5.17) (the minimum is achieved at κ ≈ 0.0015) gives dim
L
Ξ ≤ 671.004. From numerical experiments we have that the zero stationary state
ϕ 0
has a 81-dimensional unstable manifold and the Lyapunov dimension at ϕ 0
satisfies dim
L
ϕ 0
∈ (215,216). This contrasts to the Lyapunov dimension at
the positive equilibrium ϕ +
which satisfies dim
L
ϕ +
∈ (16,17). Moreover, for
P ∈ [250,10000], the value dim
L
ϕ 0
shows an approximately linear growth as
0.865· P and the dimension of the unstable manifold of ϕ 0
grows approximately
as 0.318· P. Thus (5.15) as well as the resulting estimates for the Hausdorff
or fractal dimensions of A seem to be asymptotically sharp as P → ∞ since
e
p
∗ +1
≤ e

. From this, we may conjecture the following.
Conjecture 1. For (5.19), the Eden conjecture at ϕ 0
is valid, i.e.
dim

Ξ=dim

6 Classical Nicholson blowflies model: comparison of re-
sults on the global stability
In this section, we will discuss results on the global stability of (5.19) in the
positive coneC

and compare them with applications of the Frequency Criterion
discussed in Section 4.
It can be shown (see
‡‡‡
[42]) that for δ ≥ P any solution starting in the cone

All the above methods are based on direct a priori estimates for solutions. In
[18], I. Gy¨ ori and S. Trofimchuk involved the theory of one-dimensional maps with
negative Schwarzian derivative into the problem and complemented the previous
results by the condition

It is however does not entirely cover (6.2) and (6.3).
Finally, E.Liz, V.TkachenkoandS.Trofimchukfurtherdevelopedthemethod
and obtained in [36] the region of global stability whose boundary is very close
to the region of linear instability of ϕ +
. Their result significantly improves the
previous investigations and cannot be sharpened without taking into account that
the delay in (5.19) is independent of time
§§§
.
It is however interesting to compare the Frequency Criterion (see below (4.3))
with the above mentioned results excluding the result of [36] which is unreachable
for rough general methods.
Firstly, note that by the change x(t)7→ax(τt ) we may assume in (5.19) that
a=τ =1 (with the new δ and P being δτ and Pτ respectively in the old terms)
dim
L
Ξ=0 , the global attractor cannot contain nonstationary points. There is only one stationary point in C
+
and so we must haveA={ϕ 0
}.
§§§
It is known that their criterion is sharp in the class of time-dependent delays [36].

and the above inequalities are independent on such a change. Now let us consider
the linearized equation along a solution y

We putκ :=P(d

where|F

Let A be the global attractor of π in C
+
generated by (5.19) (see Corollary
1). Note thatA is located in the ball of radius

.
Now let us apply the approximation scheme (AS.1)-(AS.4) to (6.7) con-
sidered in the context of (4.4) with P := A;
e
Aϕ := − δϕ (0) +κϕ (− 1) and
Cϕ :=ϕ (− 1) for ϕ ∈C([− 1,0];R);
e
B :=1 and the above given F

and Λ .
We use a numerical realization of the approximation scheme on Python (see
therepositoryfordetails). ParametersoftheschemearetakenasΩ=10 ,N =10,
T = 15 and ν 0
= 0.01. With such parameters, we verified the corresponding
frequency conditions for (6.7) with δ ∈ (0.1,5) and P ∈ (1.5,5). Results are
collected in Fig. 1. We note that, although the Frequency Criterion seem to
completely cover only the result of [24], it also covers a region which is not covered
by the other criteria considered
¶¶¶
. Moreover, the criterion fails for large P/δ
since the bound for the global attractor and, consequently, the Lipschitz constant
Λ become rough.
