Abstract 
 
In this paper, we are concerned with the existence of periodic solutions to second order 
nonlinear differential equations of the form  
 
) , , ( ) , ( ) ( x x t p x t f x t c x ′ = + ′ + ′ ′ . 
By using Leary-Schauder principle, we establish some new sufficient conditions which insure that this 
equation has a periodic solution.

1. Introduction 
 
It is well-known from qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations that the problem of 
existence of periodic solutions for various nonlinear differential equations of higher order continues to 
attract the attentions of many specialists despite its long history. In many works, the authors dealt with 
the problems by using Lyapunov’s or Green’s functions, and they obtained criteria for the existence of Differential Equations and Control Processes, №3, 2008 
 
periodic solutions. In particular, for the use of Green’s  functions, ones can refer to [1-10] and the 
references registered in that sources. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that in 1998, Mehri and 
Shadman [3] discussed the existence of periodic solutions to second order nonlinear differential 
equations of the form  
 
) ( ) , ( ) ( t e x t f x t c x = + ′ + ′ ′ . 
In [3], the authors used Leray-Schauder principle to show the existence of periodic solutions to this 
equation.  
Now, consider the real second order nonlinear differential equations of the type:  
 
                        ) , , ( ) , ( ) ( x x t p x t f x t c x ′ = + ′ + ′ ′ ,                                             (1) 
in which ,   and  are continuous functions in their respective domains ) , , ( x x t p ′ ) , ( x t f ) (t c [ )

[ ) ℜ × ω , 0 and [ ) ω , 0 , respectively. Further, it is assumed that all initial value problems corresponding to 
equation (1) can be extended to [ ) ω , 0 . 
 
2. Main result  
 
 
The following result is established. 
 
Theorem:  We assume that the following conditions hold: 
(i) β γ + ≤ x x t f ) , ( for all [ ] ω , 0 ∈ t and ∞ < x ,  
where γ and β are some non-negative constants. 
(ii)  ) ( ) , , ( t e x x t p ≤ ′ for all t , x and x ′ , and  is a continuous function for all ) (t e [ ] ω , 0 ∈ t .

Proof: First, we show an estimate on the magnitude of the solutions of problem:

We assume that  is a function of class ) (t x [ ] ω , 0

Now, we suppose that  is a solution of the problem given by (3). In view of the assumptions of the 
theorem, it is easily followed from (3) that

Combining the inequality (9) with Wirtinger’s inequality and (5), we obtain

This guarantees the existence of a Green’s function for the problem (3). Clearly, the problem (3)
