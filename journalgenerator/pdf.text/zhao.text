1   Introduction 
 
Recently, the use of polynomial expansions took a big part of the most 
known mathematical expansion schemes and yielded meaningful results to 
both numerical and analytical analysis [1-8]. In this context, the Boubaker 
polynomials were established as a guide for solving some applied physics 
problems [9-22] where appears, i.e.  the following equation :

In this paper, we intend to to give some new properties of the Boubaker 
polynomials. We will show among others that all positive zeros of the 
Boubaker polynomial B
n
(x) are in [0,2]. Also, we try to demonstrate that 
there are only two pure imaginary zeros of B
n
(x). 
 
 
2   History of the Boubaker polynomials 
 
2.1 The Boubaker polynomials  
 
The first monomial definition of the Boubaker polynomials [9-12] appeared 
in a physical study that yielded an analytical solution to heat equation 
inside a physical model. This monomial definition is defined by [12-18] :

2.2 The modified Boubaker polynomials (Boubaker-Turki polynomials) 
 
The Boubaker-Turki polynomials or modified Boubaker polynomials 
[10,17], which are an enhanced form of the formerly defined polynomials, 
have been established as solutions of the second order differential

prospected, some singularities for m=4, 8, 12, etc. In fact for the general 
case: m=4q the 2q rank monomial term is removed from the explicit form so 
that the whole expression contains only 2q effective terms. Correspondent 
4q-order Boubaker polynomials [11] are presented in equation (9) as a

Theorem 3.1  Let

Proof.   Making use of the recurrence relation (5) ,we obtain the following 
relation:

Hence, from (12), zeros of the Boubaker polynomial BB n
 are also eigenvalues 
of matrix [ . In fact, the eigen polynomial of the matrix is precisely the 
Boubaker polynomial. We can use the Gerschgorin's theorem [6] to 
estimate the eigenvalues of 
] M
[ ] M . By the special structure of [ , it is easy to 
see that all eigenvalues are in the circle with centre at 0 and radius 2. This 
means that the result (11) holds.

Now let us introduce the m-distribution notion [1]. A nondecreasing 
bounded function  α  defined in ]- ∞, ∞[,  is called an m-distribution, if it 
takes infinitely many distinct values, and its moments, that is, the improper 
Stieltjes integral:

It is an easy task to show that the polynomial in  of degree 4q has 
only one positive real zero. From (9), we have:

Let us check the sign changes of the coefficients in . Let us denote the

6. Conclusion  
 
 
The upper bound of the zeros of the Boubaker polynomials has been 
studied. This is of interest not only because of its application to determine 
new properties of Boubaker polynomials but also because the used method 
can be applied to solve problems in Physics, Chemistry Biology and 
Medicine.  By means of these polynomials, appropriate mathematical 
algorithms and computational methods can easily be developed to reveal 
specific information needed to solve real physiological and pathological

problems. For example, using the Boubaker polynomials expansion scheme 
described here, one can solve the Bloch NMR flow equations for different 
flow systems. With these possibilities, we can still find new and robust 
algorithms to solve very old problems. These possibilities will be explored 
in our next investigation.
