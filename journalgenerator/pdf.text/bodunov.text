Abstract
Theproblemoflocalparametricidentiﬁabilityforasemilinearparabolicequationwith
a scalar parameter is considered. Suﬃcient conditions of local parametric identiﬁability
are given for the following two approaches: (i) we observe a discretization of an exact
solution, and (ii) we observe an approximate solution generated by a discretization of the
exact equation.
The discretization of exact solution is observed at growing time moments with in-
creasing accuracy in the phase space. It is shown that given suﬃcient conditions of local
parametric identiﬁability can be checked for the Chaffee–Infante problem. In the case of
a discretization of the exact equation we do not have to reﬁne the observations as time
grows.

1 Introduction
The general identiﬁability problem for dynamical systems is formulated as follows: given
a dynamical system S(λ,t) depending on a parameter λ, is it possible to determine the
value of λ from observation of a solution (or a function of a solution)?
This problem has attracted a lot of attention. Let us mention, for example, the work
[8], in which general conditions of identiﬁability were obtained. In a recent work [16],
the identiﬁability problem was considered for an analytic ﬁnite-dimensional system of
differential equations; it was shown in [16] that if such a system depends onr parameters,
then the parameters are identiﬁable by any randomly chosen set of 2r+1 experiments.
We are interested in this paper in the problem of local parametric identiﬁability near
a given valueλ
0
of the parameter. In our case local parametric identiﬁability atλ
0
means
that the observed values for λ = λ
0
differ from those for λ with small positive values of
|λ−λ
0
|.

practical point of view, it is impossible to observe exact solutions of such equations; it is
onlypossibletoobservetheirvaluesatdiscretepointsortoobserveapproximatesolutions
given, for example, by discretization schemes.
Our goal is to give suﬃcient conditions under which the problem is locally identiﬁable
by observations of a solution with initial values from an open and dense subset of the
phase space.
In Sec. 2, we observe discretizations of exact solutions at growing time moments Tn
(where T is ﬁxed and n grows) with increasing accuracy as n → ∞. We give suﬃcient
conditionsoflocalparametricidentiﬁability(Theorem2.1)andshowthattheseconditions
can be checked for the Chaffee–Infante problem (Theorem 2.2).
In Sec. 3, we observe approximate solutions given by a semi-implicit discretization
of a parabolic equation. Suﬃcient conditions of local parametric identiﬁability are given
(Theorem3.1); itisworthnotingthatinthiscasewedonothavetoincreasetheaccuracy

In Sec. 4,we discuss some applications.

where x∈(0,π), t>0, with Dirichlet boundary conditions

We study the problem of local parametric identiﬁability for problem (2.1)–(2.3) in the
following form.
Fix a number T > 0. For any natural number n, we ﬁx a natural number m(n) so
that
m(n)→∞, n→∞. (2.4)
Electronic Journal.  2Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2006
Consider the ﬁnite arrays
V(λ,n,u
0
) ={u(λ,kh
n
,Tn,u
0
) : 0<k≤m(n)−1}
deﬁned for n> 0, where
h
n
=

m(n)
.
The array V(λ,n,u
0
) is the set of values of a solution u(λ,x,t,u
0
) on a ﬁnite subset
{(kh
n
,Tn) : 0<k≤m(n)−1}
of the set (0,π)×{Tn}.
Condition (2.4) means that we observe the solution at time momentsTn with increas-
ing accuracy as n→∞.
First we ﬁx the spaces we work with.
We consider the standard Sobolev space H
1
[0,π]
with the norm deﬁned by

Let H

be the following subspace of H

[0,π]
:
H

: u(0) =u(π) =0

We use below the norm

,
which is equivalent to the above-mentioned norm. We also consider the Sobolev space

with the norm

We assume that f(λ,·)∈C
2
(R).
Our basic structural assumption on the nonlinearity f is as follows: there exists a
function C(λ), λ∈R, such that
uf(λ,u)≤C(λ). (2.5)
It is well known [9] that under condition (2.5) problem (2.1)–(2.3) generates an evolution-
ary system S(λ,t), t>0, in the space H
1
0
, so that for any u
0
∈H
1
0
, the solution
u(λ,x,t,u
0
) =S(λ,t)u
0
(x)
is deﬁned for all t > 0. In addition, condition (2.5) implies that S(λ,t) has a global
attractor A(λ) in H
1
0
[9, 15].
Let us give the main deﬁnition.
We say that problem (2.1)–(2.3) is locally identiﬁable at λ = λ
0
via reﬁning obser-
vations of a solution u(λ
0
,x,t,u
0
) if there exists a number ε > 0 such that for any λ,
0<|λ−λ
0
|<ε, and for any v
0
∈H
1
0
there exists n
0
> 0 such that
V(λ
0
,n,u
0
)6=V(λ,n,v
0
)
Electronic Journal.  3Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2006
for n≥n
0
.
This deﬁnition corresponds to the general deﬁnition of local identiﬁability of nonlinear
systems of ordinary differential equations via observations of their solutions at discrete
time moments [4].
Denote by F(λ), λ ∈ R, the set of ﬁxed points of the system S(λ,t). Obviously, a
function u(x) is a ﬁxed point of S(λ,t) if and only if u(x) is a solution of the following
boundary-value problem:
d
2
u
dx
2
+f(λ,u) =0, u(0) =u(π) =0. (2.6)
It is known that any system S(λ,t) has a global Lyapunov function
V(u) =
π
Z
0
 
1
2
|∇u|
2
−F(u)
 
dx,
whereF is the antiderivative off with respect tou; this function decreases along noncon-
stant solutions [9,15]. Thus, for anyu
0
∈H
1
0
, the solutionS(λ,t)u
0
tends to the setF(λ).
If we denote by ω(λ,u
0
) the ω-limit set of the solution S(λ,t)u
0
[15], then the following
inclusions obviously hold:
ω(λ,u
0
)⊂F(λ)⊂A(λ), u
0
∈H
1
0
, λ∈R. (2.7)
Now let us impose the following condition on f(λ,u) at λ
0
.
Condition I at λ
0
. For any δ > 0, there exist numbers v
+
∈ (0,δ), v
−
∈ (−δ,0), and
μ> 0 such that
f(λ,v
+
)6=f(λ
0
,v
+
) and f(λ,v
−
)6=f(λ
0
,v
−
)
for 0<|λ−λ
0
|<μ.
Obviously, Condition I at λ
0
is a corollary of the following condition.
Condition II at λ
0
. The function f(λ,u) is continuously differentiable in λ on the set
R×{0} and
∂f
∂λ
(λ,0)
 
 
 
 
λ=λ
0
6= 0.
The main result of Sec. 2 is the following statement.
Theorem 2.1. Assume that
(a) all ﬁxed points of the system S(λ
0
,t) are hyperbolic;
(b) if f(λ
0
,0) =0, then the ﬁxed point u≡ 0 of S(λ
0
,t) is unstable;
(c) Condition I at λ
0
is satisﬁed.
Then there exists an open and dense subset H of the space H
1
0
such that, for u
0
∈H,
problem (2.1)–(2.2) is locally identiﬁable at λ
0
via reﬁning observations of the solution
u(λ
0
,x,t,u
0
).
If f(λ
0
,0)6= 0, then one may take H =H
1
0
.
We begin the proof of Theorem 2.1 with an auxiliary statement.
Lemma 2.1. Let condition I at λ
0
be satisﬁed. If u(λ
0
,x) is a nonzero solution of the
boundary-value problem (2.6), then there exists Δ> 0 such that, for any solution u(λ,x)
of (2.6) with 0<|λ−λ
0
|< Δ,
u(λ,x)6≡u(λ
0
,x). (2.8)
Electronic Journal.  4Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2006
Proof. Since u(λ
0
,x)6≡ 0,
u
∗
= max
x∈[0,π]
|u(λ
0
,x)|> 0.
Apply Condition I at λ
0
to ﬁnd numbers v
+
∈ (0,u
∗
), v
−
∈ (−u
∗
,0), and the corre-
sponding μ> 0. We claim that we may take Δ =μ.
Fix x
0
∈(0,π) such that
u
∗
=|u(λ
0
,x
0
)|.
Assume thatu(λ
0
,x
0
)> 0 (the caseu(λ
0
,x
0
)< 0 is considered similarly). Then there
exists x
1
∈(0,π) such that
u(λ
0
,x
1
) =v
+
(since u(λ
0
,0) =0).
Take λ ∈ R with 0 < |λ−λ
0
| < Δ and any solution u(λ,x) of the corresponding
problem (2.6). Ifu(λ,x
1
)6=u(λ
0
,x
1
), then (2.8) holds. Otherwise,u(λ,x
1
) =u(λ

, and it follows from Condition I at λ

that

This proves (2.8).
Corollary. The sets of nonzero ﬁxed paints of the systems S(λ
0
,t) and S(λ,t) are
disjoint if 0<|λ−λ
0
|< Δ.
Let us proceed with the proof of Theorem 2.1.
Take an array V(λ,n,u
0
) and construct a continuous piecewise-linear function
v
∗
(λ,x,n,u
0
) on [0,π] as follows:
v
∗
(λ,kh
n
,n,u
0
) =u(λ,kh
n
,Tn,u
0
), k = 0,...,m(n),
and v
∗
(λ,·,n,u
0
) is linear on any segment
[kh
n
,(k+1)h
n
], k = 0,...,m(n)−1.
It is known (see [1, Chapter 1]) that, for any λ∈R, the operator S(λ,t) is a bounded
operator from H
1
0
into H
2
0
, i.e., for any v
0
∈ H
1
0
there exists a constant K = K(λ,v
0
)
such that
kS(λ,t)v
0
k
2
≤K, t>0.
Elementary estimates (see [2] for details) show that, for any v
0
∈H
1
0
and any λ∈R,
kv
∗
(λ,x,n,v
0
)−u(λ,x,Tn,v
0
)k→ 0 as n→∞. (2.9)
Assume thatf(λ
0
,0) =0 (the casef(λ
0
,0)6= 0 is more simple since in this caseu≡ 0
is not a ﬁxed point of the system S(λ
0
,t)).
Assumptions(a)and(b)ofourtheoremimplythatu≡ 0isahyperbolicunstableﬁxed
point of the system S(λ
0
,t), hence its stable manifold, W
S
(0), has positive codimension
in the space H
1
0
.
Obviously, in this case the set
H =H
1
0
\W
S
(0) (2.10)
is an open and dense subset of H
1
0
.
Electronic Journal.  5Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2006
Take u
0
∈ H and the corresponding solution u(λ
0
,x,t,u
0
). It was mentioned above
that
u(λ
0
,x,t,u
0
)→F(λ
0
) as t→∞.
Since all ﬁxed points ofS(λ
0
,t) are hyperbolic, they are isolated. The global attractor
A(λ
0
) is compact and contains all ﬁxed points of S(λ
0
,t), hence the set F(λ
0
) is ﬁnite.
Since the setω(λ
0
,u
0
) is connected [15], it coincides with a single ﬁxed point; denote this
point by w(x). It follows from (2.10) that w(x)6≡ 0.
Apply Lemma 2.1 to ﬁnd, for the solution w(x), a number ε > 0 such that if 0 <
|λ−λ
0
|<ε, then any solution u(λ,x) of (2.6) satisﬁes
u(λ,x)6≡w(x). (2.11)
We claim that this number ε> 0 has the property described in the deﬁnition of local
identiﬁability via reﬁning observations.
Indeed, take λ such that 0<|λ−λ
0
|<ε and an arbitrary initial function v
0
∈H
1
0
.
The set ω(λ,v
0
) is a closed subset of the compact set A(λ) (see inclusion (2.7)). This
set consists of solutions u(λ,x) of the boundary-value problem (2.6). Hence, inequality
(2.11) implies that there exists a positive number a> 0 such that
dist(w(x),ω(λ,v
0
)) =a, (2.12)
where dist is the distance generated by the norm of the space H
1
0
.
To obtain a contradiction, assume that there exists a sequencen
m
of natural numbers
such that n
m
→∞ as m→∞ and
V(λ
0
,n
m
,u
0
) =V(λ,n
m
,v
0
) (2.13)
for all m.
Construct the corresponding continuous piecewise-linear functions
v
∗
(λ
0
,x,n
m
,u
0
) and v
∗
(λ,x,n
m
,v
0
); for brevity, we denote these functions by v
∗
0,m
(x)
and v
∗
m
(x), respectively. By (2.13),
v
∗
0,m
(x)≡v
∗
m
(x) (2.14)
for all m.
Since
ku(λ
0
,x,n
m
,u
0
)−w(x)k→ 0,
it follows from (2.9) that
kv
∗
0,m
(x)−w(x)k→ 0 (2.15)
as m→∞.
Similarly, since
dist(u(λ,x,n
m
,v
0
),ω(λ,v
0
))→ 0,
it follows from (2.9) that
dist(v
∗
m
(x),ω(λ,v
0
))→ 0 (2.16)
as m→∞.
Combining relations (2.12), (2.14), (2.15) and (2.16), we get the desired contradiction.
Theorem 2.1 is proved.
Remark 2.1. I.Kukavica and J.C.Robinson in [12] studied the problem of distin-
guishability of global attractors for PDEs (in particular, for reaction-diffusion equations
of the type of Eq.(2.1)). They show that it is possible to distinguish between different
Electronic Journal.  6Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2006
elements of the attractor by measurement of the solutions at almost every set of k points
of the domain (where k is estimated by the dimension of the attractor).
Our approach is based on a quite different idea. Though we refer to the existence of
the global attractor (and to some of its properties), we do not have to ﬁnd its elements;
we just start with an almost arbitrary initial pointu
0
of the phase space and compare the
solution S(λ
0
,t)u
0
with any solution S(λ,t)v.
The proof of the main result in [12] in the nonanalytic case is based on a theorem
by C.C.
˙
Poon [14] stating that differences of solutions on the global attractor have “ﬁnite
order of vanishing”. Since no such result is available for differences of arbitrary solutions
S(λ
0
,t)u and S(λ,t)v with λ6=λ
0
, we cannot replace our condition of reﬁning the space
resolution by measurements at a ﬁnite set of points whose cardinality does not depend
on the unknown value of λ (but our results in Sec.3 show that the latter is possible if we
work with a discretization of Eq.(2.1)).
It follows from Lemma 2.1 that if Condition I at λ
0
is satisﬁed, then, for any λ with
0<|λ−λ
0
|< Δ, there exists δ(λ)> 0 such that
ku−vk≥δ(λ)
for any nonzero ﬁxed points u of S(λ
0
,t) and v of S(λ,t), respectively. Let us note that
δ(λ)→ 0 as λ→λ
0
in our case, since for hyperbolic ﬁxed points u of S(λ
0
,t) there exist
families of ﬁxed points v(λ) of S(λ,t) such thatku−v(λ)k→ 0 as λ→λ
0
(see [9]).
If we ﬁx λ with 0 <|λ−λ
0
| < Δ, u
0
6∈ W
S
(0), and an arbitrary v
0
, then there exist
w(x)∈F(λ
0
), w(x)6≡ 0, u(λ,x)∈F(λ), and T(λ)> 0 such that
ku(λ
0
,x,t,u
0
)−w(x)k<δ(λ)/4
and
ku(λ,x,t,v
0
)−u(λ,x)k<δ(λ)/4
for t≥T(λ).
Atthesametime, theproofofestimate(2.9)in[2]showsthatthereexistsN
0
=N
0
(λ)
such that if the discretization space step is
h =
π
N
0
,
then the corresponding piecewise-linear functions v
∗
(λ
0
,x,n,u
0
) and v
∗
(λ,x,n,v
0
) (con-
structed by the mesh with ﬁxed step h) satisfy the inequalities
kv
∗
(λ
0
,x,n,u
0
)−u(λ
0
,x,Tn,u
0
)k<δ(λ)/4
and
kv
∗
(λ,x,n,v
0
)−u(λ,x,Tn,v
0
)k<δ(λ)/4,
respectively, for n≥ 1.
It follows that the solutions u(λ
0
,x,t,u
0
) and u(λ,x,t,v
0
) are distinguishable by ob-
servations at a ﬁxed (not reﬁned) mesh.
But our reasoning shows that the step h of this mesh will depend on λ, and we have
no hope to get reasonable estimates of this dependence (since our Condition I at λ
0
does
not exclude cases of very degenerate behavior of f(λ,u) near λ
0
).
For this reason, we prefer to formulate Theorem 2.1 for measurements with reﬁning
space resolution.
Remark 2.2. Let us discuss the assumptions of Theorem 2.1. While it is relatively
easy to check conditions (b) and (c), condition (a) does not seem very natural.
Electronic Journal.  7Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 3, 2006
Nevertheless, let us recall that, by the main result of [5], if we consider, instead of
equation (2.1), an equation without a parameter,
u
t
=u
xx
+f(u),
then any ﬁxed point of the corresponding evolutionary system is hyperbolic for nonlinear-
ities f(u) belonging to a residual subset of the function space C
k
(R,R), k≥ 2 (i.e., for a
countable intersection of dense and open subsets of this function space).
Conditions of Theorem 2.1 are easily checked for a Chaffee–Infante problem [9, 6]
with linear dependence on the parameter.
Assume that f(λ,u) = λg(u) in (2.1), where the function g ∈ C
2
(R,R) satisﬁes the
following conditions:
(CI1) g(0) =0, g
0
(0) =1;
(CI2) limsup
|u|→∞
g(u)
u
≤ 0;
(CI3) ug
00
(u)< 0 for u6= 0.
Atypicalexampleofafunctiong(u)satisfyingconditions(CI1)–(CI3)isg(u) =u−u
3
.
It is known [9] that, under these conditions, the corresponding semigroup S(λ,t) has
a global attractor for any λ> 0, and its trajectories tend to the union of ﬁxed points as
t→∞.
In addition, it is known that if
λ> 1, λ6=m
2
, m∈Z, (2.17)
then any ﬁxed point of S(λ,t) is hyperbolic, while the zero ﬁxed point is unstable.
Finally, it is easy to see that if a functiong(u) satisﬁes condition(CI3), thenit has not
more than 2 nonzero roots. Hence, Condition I is obviously satisﬁed by f(λ,u) = λg(u)
at any λ
0
6= 0.
Thus, the following statement is a corollary of Theorem 2.1.
Theorem 2.2. Assume that f(λ,u) = λg(u) in equation (2.1), where the function
g(u) satisﬁes conditions (CI1)–(CI3). Then, for anyλ
0
satisfying inequalities (2.17), there
exists an open and dense subsetH of the space H
1
0
such that, for u
0
∈H, problem (2.1)−
(2.3) is locally identiﬁable at λ
0
via reﬁning observations of the solution u(λ
0
,x,t,u
0
).
This theorem generalizes the main result of [2].
3 Discretization of the equation
Let us consider the following usual semi-implicit discretization of equation (2.1). We ﬁx a
natural numberN, setd =
π
N +1
, and leth> 0 to be the time step of the discretization.
We approximate the values u(λ,md,nh,u

by the following discretization scheme:

(3.2)
such that v

We assume everywhere that
hkAk< 1, (3.3)
where kAk is the operator norm of the matrix A. Under condition (3.3), the mapping
(3.2) is given by
ϕ(λ,v) =J

where J =E

It is shown in [13] that if, for a ﬁxed λ,

∂

≤M, and hM < 1, (3.5)
then ϕ(λ,v) is a diffeomorphism of the space R
N
. We also assume that inequalities (2.5)
hold for λ∈R.
In this section, we pay the main attention to the case f(λ,u) = λg(u), since in this
casethesuﬃcientconditionsoflocalidentiﬁabilityarequitesimple(wediscussthegeneral
case later, in Remark 3.2).
Thus, let f(λ,u) =λg(u).
We ﬁx λ
0
∈R and assume that conditions (3.5) are satisﬁed for (λ,u)∈Λ×R, where
Λ is a neighborhood of λ
0
.
Theorem 3.1. Assume that f(λ,u) =λg(u) and
(a) all ﬁxed points of the diffeomorphism ϕ(λ
0
,·) are hyperbolic;
(b) if g(0) =0, then the ﬁxed point u = 0 of ϕ(λ
0
,·) is unstable.
Then there exists an open and dense subsetH⊂R
N
such that, for anyu
0
∈H, scheme
(3.1) is locally identiﬁable at λ
0
via observations of the trajectory {ϕ
n
(λ
0
,u
0
) : n ≥ 0}
in the following sense: there exists a number ε> 0 such that for any λ, 0<|λ−λ
0
|<ε,
and any v
0
∈R
N
, there exists n
0
> 0 such that
ϕ
n
(λ
0
,u
0
)6=ϕ
n
(λ,v
0
)
for n≥n
0
.
If g(0)6= 0 and λ
0
6= 0, then one may take H =R
N
.
Proof. It is shown in [13] that, for any λ, the diffeomorphism ϕ(λ,·) has a global
Lyapunov function. Hence, any its trajectory tends to the set F(λ) of ﬁxed points of
ϕ(λ,·).
Since ﬁxed points of ϕ(λ
0
,·) are hyperbolic, each of them is isolated in F(λ
0
). It
follows that, for any u
0
∈R
N
, its trajectory ϕ
n
(λ
0
,u
0
) tends to a single ﬁxed point.
Assume that g(0) =0 (the case g(0)6= 0 is more simple since in this case u = 0 is not
a ﬁxed point of ϕ(λ
0
,·)).
Similarly to Theorem 2.1 (formula (2.10)), we deﬁne H by the formula H = R
N
\
W
S
(0), where W
S
(0) is the stable manifold of the hyperbolic unstable ﬁxed point u = 0
of ϕ(λ
0
,·). The setH is an open and dense subset of R
N
.

It follows from formula (3.4) that w∈R
N
is a ﬁxed point of ϕ(λ,·) if and only if
Aw+λg(w) =0. (3.6)
Consider the function
Φ(λ,w) =ϕ(λ,w)−w.
This function is continuously differentiable in λ and w. In addition,
Φ(λ
0
,w
0
) =0
since w
0
is a ﬁxed point of ϕ(λ
0
,·).
The point w
0
is a hyperbolic ﬁxed point of ϕ(λ
0
,·), hence the eigenvalues λ
j
of the
Jacobi matrix
∂ϕ(λ
0
,w)
∂w
 
 
 
 
w=w

satisfy the inequalities|λ

By the implicit function theorem, the equation
Φ(λ,w) =0
has a unique (and continuously differentiable) solutionw(λ) in a neighborhood ofλ
0
, and
w(λ
0
) =w
0
.
Thus, we may differentiate equation (3.6) at λ
0
; we obtain the following equality:
A
∂w
∂λ
 
 
 
 
λ=λ

+g(w(λ

D

where
D = diag
 
g

(w

and
w
0
= (w
0,1
,...,w
0,N
).
Since w
0
6= 0 and the matrix A is nondegenerate, Aw
0
6= 0. It follows from equality
(3.6) (with λ =λ
0
) that g(w
0
)6= 0.
Now equality (3.7) implies that
∂w
∂λ
 
 
 
 
λ=λ

6= 0. (3.8)
It follows that there exists ε > 0 such that, for 0 <|λ−λ

ϕ(λ,·) does not have ﬁxed points coinciding with w
0
.

n
(λ,v

), the following inclusions hold:
ω(λ,v

)⊂F(λ)⊂A(λ).
F(λ) is a closed subset of the compact set A(λ), hence F(λ) is compact. It was shown
above that
w

hence
dist(w

,ω(λ,v

))> 0. (3.9)
Relation (3.9) and the relations
dist(ϕ

and
ϕ

imply the statement of Theorem 3.1.
Remark 3.1. Note that, in contrast to Sec. 2, in the case of scheme (3.1) we do not
have to reﬁne the observations of trajectories ϕ
n
(λ
0
,u
0
) and ϕ
n
(λ,v
0
).
Remark 3.2. It is possible to apply a similar reasoning in the general case where the
nonlinearity in (2.1) has the form f(λ,u). Obviously, in this case the condition
∂f
∂λ
∈C,
∂
∂λ
f(λ,u)
 
 
 
 
λ=λ

6= 0 for all u (3.10)
is suﬃcient.
Indeed, in this case equality (3.7) is replaced by the equality

λ=λ

∂f

∂w

λ=λ

= 0.
This equality and condition (3.10) imply that inequality (3.8) holds. The rest of the
proof is the same as in Theorem 3.1.
Remark 3.3. For a ﬁxed λ
0
, the genericity of condition (a) in Theorem 3.1 is estab-
lished in [7].
Remark 3.4. Theorem 3.1 generalizes the main result of [3], established for the
Chaffee–Infante problem.
4 Applications
Equations of the type (2.1) are widely used in applications (it is enough to mention
the famous Kolmogorov–Petrovski–Piskunov equation [10]).
For new applications, let us mention the work [11] in which the Landau–Khalatnikov
equation is reduced to the Chaffee–Infante problem

, η(0) =η(π) =0. (4.1)
Equation (4.1) models the evolution of a binary alloy; the parameter λ is directly
related to the temperature of the alloy.
Of course, the results of this paper are of theoretical character; they only give us
conditions of parametric identiﬁability (i.e., the possibility of parameter identiﬁcation)
and not an algorithm of identiﬁcation itself.
Nevertheless, it is interesting to apply the method of Sec.3 to check the “rate of
divergence” of solutions of scheme (3.1) for different values of λ.
Below, we represent results of numerical simulation of Eq.(4.1) for some values of λ
0
and λ.
