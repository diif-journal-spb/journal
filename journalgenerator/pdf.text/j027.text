ical system structure is presented. The dynamical system is associated with an
oriented graph called a symbolic image of the system. The symbolic image can
be considered as a ﬁnite approximation of the dynamical system. An investiga-
tion of the symbolic image gives an opportunity to get a neighborhood of the
chainrecurrenttrajectoriesset. Analgorithmforlocalizationofchainrecurrent

1 Introduction
At present the methods of symbolic dynamics have wide applications. In this
paper one of the variants of such application is presents. Our purpose is to
substantiate an algorithm for localization of the chain recurrent set without
any preliminary information about the system. All needed estimates can be
obtained by the traditional numerical methods of differential equations. The
common scheme of our method is the following. At ﬁrst, the dynamical system
is associated with an oriented graph called Symbolic Image of the system.
Valuable information about the global structure of the system may come from
the analysis of this symbolic image. By investigating the symbolic image we
canseparatethepointsthroughwhichperiodictrajectoriesmaypassfromthose
through which periodic trajectories do not pass. This permits the construction
of a neighborhood of the chain recurrent set, which includes all the types of re-
turning trajectories ( e.g., periodic, almost-periodic, recurrent, homoclinic and
so on). Using a special sequence of symbolic images we obtain a sequence of
embedded neighborhoods which converges to the chain recurrent set. The pro-
posed construction of the symbolic image is close to the Cell-to-Cell Mappings
of C.S.Hsu [6].
We will consider a discrete dynamical system governed by a homeomor-
phismX deﬁned on a compact manifoldM. To describe the continuous version
of dynamic system consider a shift operator along trajectories of the system
of differential equations which is generated as follows. Let ˙ x = f(t,x) be a
system of ordinary differential equations, where x ∈ M, f(t,x) is a C
1
vector
ﬁeld periodic in t with period ω. Denote its general solution by F(t,t
0
,x),
F(t
0
,t
0
,x) = x. For investigation of the global evolution of the system, it usu-
ally is suﬃcient to examine a Poincare map X(x) = F(ω,0,x) which is the
shift operator along the trajectories of the system on the period ω. If the sys-
tem of differential equations is autonomous (i.e., the vector ﬁeld f does not
depend on t ), we ﬁx an arbitrary H 6= 0 and consider a shift operator of the
form X(x) =F(H,x), where F(t,x) is the solution of the autonomous system,
F(0,x) =x.

2 Chain recurrent set
Let us consider a homeomorphism X : M → M on a smooth compact C
∞
-
manifold M.
Deﬁnition 1 Let ε > 0 be given. An inﬁnite sequence {x
k
: k ∈ N} is called
an ε-trajectory of X if for any k the distance between the image X(x
k
) and x
k+1
is less than ε :
ρ(X(x
k
),x
k+1
)<ε,
where ρ(x,y) is the distance between points x and y on M.
In the majority of cases an exact trajectory is seldom known, and in fact
we ﬁnd only ε-trajectories for suﬃciently small positive ε.
Deﬁnition 2 If an ε-trajectory {x
k
} is periodic, i.e., x
k+p
= x
k
for some
p ∈ N, then it is called a p-periodic ε-trajectory and each points x = x
k
is
called (p,ε)-periodic.
For example, on the plane R
2
consider a map of the form: X(x,y) =
(y, 0.05(1− x
2
)y − x). Take the sequence x
1
= (2,0), x
2
= (0,−2), x
3
=
(−2,0), x
4
= (0,2), x
k+4
=x
k
. Thisis4-periodicε-trajectorywithanyε> 0.1.
A p-periodic sequence {x
k
} is deﬁned by its periodic part {x
1
, x
2
, ..., x
p
}
putting x
k+p
= x
k
. We will say about ε-periodic point x if its period p is not
ﬁxed. Denote the set of allε-periodic points byQ(ε). It is not diﬃcult to prove
the following proposition describing the properties of Q(ε).
Proposition 1 (i) The sets Q(ε), ε> 0 is open.
(ii) If ε
1
>ε
2
then Q(ε
2
)⊂Q(ε
1
).
Deﬁnition 3 A point x is called chain recurrent if x is ε-periodic for each
positive ε, i.e., there exists a periodic ε-trajectory passing through x. A chain
recurrent set, denoted Q, is the set of all the chain recurrent points
It is know [3] that the chain recurrent set is invariant, closed, and contains
periodic, nonwandering and other singular trajectories. It should be remarked
that if a chain recurrent point is not periodic then there exists as small as one
likes perturbation of X in C
0
-topology for which this point is periodic [3]. One
Electronic Journal.  61Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 1998
may say that a chain recurrent point may become periodic under small C
0
-
perturbations of the map X. From the deﬁnition of the chain recurrent set it
immediately follows that
Q = lim
ε→0
Q(ε) =
\
ε>0
Q(ε) (1)
Thus the family of open sets {Q(ε), ε > 0} forms a fundamental system of
neighborhoods of the chain recurrent set Q.
3 Construction of the Symbolical Image [9]
Let C ={M(1),...,M(n)} be a ﬁnite covering of the domain M by closed sets.
The set M(i) is named a cell of the covering. For each cell M(i) we deﬁne the
covering C(i), i = 1,...,n, of the image X(M(i)) consisting of cells M(j)∈ C
whose intersections with X(M(i)) are not empty :
C(i) ={M(j) :M(j)∩X(M(i))6=∅}.
Set
c(i) ={j :M(j)∩X(M(i))6=∅}.
The cells of the covering C(i) are called the image cells of M(i) under X.
Let us construct the oriented graph G (see Fig.1) associating to each cell M(i)
the vertex i . The vertices i and j are connected by the oriented edge i → j
if and only if j ∈ c(i), i.e., the cell M(j) is included in the covering of the cell
M(i).
Deﬁnition 4 The constructed graph G is called the symbolic image of X with
respect to the covering C.
The oriented graph G is uniquely determined by its n×n matrix of tran-
sitions Π = (π
ij
), where π
ij
= 1 if and only if there is the oriented edge i→ j,
otherwiseπ
ij
= 0. It is easily seen that the symbolic image depends on the cov-
ering C. By varying C one can change the symbolic image of the mapping X.
We can consider the symbolical image as a ﬁnite approximation of the mapping
X. It is natural to expect this approximation to be more precise provided the
mesh of the covering is made smaller.

Figure 1: Construction of Symbolic Image.
Let
diamM(i) = max(ρ(x,y) :x,y∈M(i))
be the diameter of the cellM(i), andd be the largest diameter of the cells from
C. Denote a union of the cells M(j) belonging to the covering C(i) by R
i
:
R
i
=
[
j∈c(i)
M(j)
By construction, R
i
contains the image X(M(i)) of the cell M(i) and is con-
tained in the closed d-neighborhood of the image X(M(i)) :
X(M(i))⊂R
i
⊂{x :ρ(x,y)≤d, y∈X(M(i))}.
Let q be the largest diameter of the images X(M(i)), i = 1,2,...,n. We deﬁne
the number r as follows. If a cell M(k) does not belong to the covering C(i)
then the distance
r
ik
=ρ(X(M(i)),M(k)) = min(ρ(x,y) :x∈X(M(i)),y∈M(k))
between the cell M(k) and the image X(M(i)) is positive. Let r be minimum
of suchr
ik
. Since the number of pairs (i,k) described above is ﬁnite thenr > 0.
So the number r is the smallest distance between the images X(M(i)) and the
cells M(k) whose intersections are empty. The number r is called the lower
bound of the symbolic image G. The lower bound depends on the covering C.
By varying C one can construct a covering for whichr is arbitrarily small. The
next propositions describe some properties of lower bound.
Proposition 2 If a point x∈M(j) and ρ(x,X(M(i)))<r then the cell M(j)
belongs to the covering C(i).
Electronic Journal.  63Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 1998
Proof. Let x ∈ M(j). Since the distance ρ(x,X(M(i))) < r then the
distance between the cell M(j) and the image X(M(i)) is less than r. By
the deﬁnition of the lower bound, the number r is the smallest distance be-
tween the images X(M(i)) and cells M(k) which do not intersect. Since
ρ(M(j),X(M(i)))<r then the cell M(j) has to intersect the image X(M(i)).
Consequently, the cell M(j) belongs to the covering C(i).  
Corollary 1 The set R
i
={∪M(j) : j ∈ c(i)} contains r-neighborhood of the
image X(M(i)) :
{x : ρ(x,X(M(i))<r}⊂R
i
.
Proposition 3 The lower bound r satisﬁes the inequality r≤d.
Proof. The number of pairs (i,k) such that r
ik
= ρ(X(M(i)),M(k)) > 0
is ﬁnite. Hence there exists a pair (i,m) for which r = r
im
and the segment
[x
j
,x
m
] of the geodesic realizes the value r . This means that there exist points
x
j
∈X(M(j)) and x
m
∈M(m), X(M(j))∩M(m) =∅ such that the length of
the segment [x
j
,x
m
] is equal to r. Since the number r is the smallest distance
between the non intersecting images X(M(i)) and cells M(k), all points of the
open segment (x
j
,x
m)
do not belong to the cell M(m), and belong to some
cells from the covering C(j). Since the cells are closed, the point x
m
belongs
to some cell M(q) from C(j). We have r = ρ(x
m
,X(M(j))), x
m
∈ M(q),
M(q)∩X(M(j)) 6= ∅ . Hence, there is a point x
q
∈ M(q)∩X(M(j)) . From
this it follows that r =ρ(x
m
,X(M(j)))≤ρ(x
m
,x
q
)≤diamM(q)≤d .  
4 Structure of the Symbolic Image
Deﬁnition 5 A sequence{z
k
} of vertices of the graphG is called an admissible
path (or simply a path) if for each k the graph G contains the oriented edge
z
k
→z
k+1
.
A path {z
k
} is said to be p-periodic if z
k
= z
k+p
for each k ∈ N. There
is a natural connection between the admissible paths on the symbolic image
G and the ε -trajectories of the homeomorphism X. It can be said that an
admissible path is the trace of an ε-trajectory and vice versa. However, there
aresomerelationshipsbetweentheparametersd,q,r ofthesymbolicimageand
the number ε for which the connections take place.
Electronic Journal.  64Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 1998
Proposition 4 If a sequence {z
k
} is a path on the symbolic image G and a
sequence{x
k
} is such thatx
k
∈M(z
k
), then the sequence{x
k
} is anε-trajectory
of X for any ε>q+d.
Proof. Let{z
k
} be an admissible path onG. Consequently, there exists an
oriented edge z
k
→z
k+1
for every number k. This means that the cell M(z
k+1
)
belongs to the covering C(z
k
). Hence, the image X(M(z
k
)) intersects the cell
M(z
k+1
) and
ρ(X(x
k
),x
k+1
)≤diamX(M(z
k
))+diamM(z
k+1
)≤q+d.
Therefore, the sequence {x
k
} is an ε-trajectory of X for each ε > q +d. Note
thatthepointx
k
isdeﬁnedbytheinclusionx
k
∈M(z
k
). Hencetheconstructed
sequence {x
k
} is non uniquely determined by the path {z
k
} 
Corollary 2 If a sequence {z
1
,z
2
,...,z
p
} of vertices is a p-periodic path and a
sequence{x
1
,x
2
,...,x
p
} is such thatx
k
∈M(z
k
), then the sequence{x
1
,x
2
,...,x
p
}
is a p-periodic ε-trajectory for each ε>d+q.
Proposition 5 If a sequence{z
k
} is a path on the symbolic image G then there
exists a sequence{x
k
}, x
k
∈M(z
k
) which is anε-trajectory ofX for eachε>d.

i.e.,

We can say the pairx

) realizes the oriented edgez
k
→z
k+1
. Fix such
x
k
for each k ∈ N, and check that the sequence {x
k
} is ε-trajectory for any
ε>d. In fact, the image X(x
k
) and the point x
k+1
belong to the cell M(z
k+1
)
by construction. Hence, the distance
ρ(X(x
k
),x
k+1
)≤diamM(z
k+1
)≤d<ε.
Note that in the considered case the sequence{x
k
} is non unique as well, how-
ever the point x
k
is determined by the inclusion (2).  
Corollary 3 If a sequence {z
1
, z
2
,..., z
p
} is a p-periodic path on the symbolic
image G then there exists a sequence {x
1
, x

p
}, x
k
∈ M(z
k
) which is
p-periodic ε-trajectory for each ε>d.
Electronic Journal.  65Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 1998
Proposition 6 If a sequence {x
k
} is an ε-trajectory of X, ε < r, and x
k
∈
M(z
k
), then the sequence {z
k
} is an admissible path on the symbolic image G.
Proof. Let the hypotheses of the proposition hold. Fix some integer k ∈
N. Since ρ(X(x
k
),x
k+1
) < r and x
k
∈ M(z
k
) then ρ(X(M(z
k
)),M(z
k+1
)) <
r. Because r is the smallest distance between X(M(i)) and M(k) such that
M(k)∩X(M(i)) =∅, the cell M(z
k+1
) has to intersect X(M(z
k
)). Thus there
exists the oriented edge z
k
→z
k+1
for each k∈N, and the sequence{z
k
} is an
admissible path on the symbolic image G.  
Corollary 4 If a sequence {x
1
,x
2
,...,x
p
} is a p-periodic ε-trajectory, ε < r
and a sequence {z
1
,z
2
,...,z
p
} is such that x
k
∈ M(z
k
), then the sequence
{z
1
,z
2
,...,z
p
} is an admissible p-periodic path on the symbolic image G.
Deﬁnition 6 A vertex of the symbolic image is called recurrent if a periodic
path passes through it.
Denote by P(d) the union of the cells M(i) for which the vertex i is recur-
rent, i.e.,
P(d) ={∪M(i) :i is recurrent}, (3)
where d is the largest diameter of the cells M(i). It should be noted that P
depends generally on the covering C. However, in what follows we need only
to consider the dependence of P on the largest diameter d. Denote by T the
union of the cells M(k) for which the vertex k is non recurrent, i.e.,
T ={∪M(k) : k is non recurrent}.
The following theorem describes the properties of the sets P(d) and T.
Theorem 1 (i) The set P(d) is a closed neighborhood of the chain recurrent
set. Moreover, P(d) is a subset of ε-periodic point set for each ε>q+d, i.e.,
Q⊂P(d)⊂Q(ε), ε>q+d. (4)
(ii) If the maximum diameter d is small enough then this neighborhood is
suﬃciently small, i.e., for any neighborhood H of Q there exists d> 0 such that
P(d)⊂H.
Electronic Journal.  66Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 1998
(iii) The chain recurrent set Q coincides with the intersection of the sets
P(d) for all positive d:
Q =
\
d>0
P(d). (5)
(iv) The points of T are not chain recurrent, i.e., T ∩Q =∅. Moreover, if
ε<r then there is no periodic ε-trajectory passing through x∈T, i.e.,
Q(ε)∩T =∅, ε<r.
Proof. (i) Suppose we are given ε
1
,ε
2
, such that ε
1
< r < q +d < ε
2
. At
ﬁrst we prove that
Q(ε
1
)⊂P(d)⊂Q(ε
2
). (6)
In fact, if a point x belongs to Q(ε
1
), then there exists a periodic ε
1
-
trajectory {x
1
,...,x
p
} passing through x = x
1
. Consider a ﬁnite sequence
of cells {M(z
i
) : i = 1,...,p} such that x
i
∈ M(z
i
). Because ε
1
< r, according
to Corollary 4 the sequence{z
i
} is an admissible periodic path passing through
thevertexz
1
. Thusthevertexz
1
isrecurrent. HencethecellM(z
1
)iscontained
in P(d). From this it follows that Q(ε
1
)⊂P(d).
Consider a point x belonging to P(d). There exists a cell M(z) such that
x∈M(z)andthevertexz isrecurrent. InotherwordsonthesymbolicimageG
there exists a periodic path{z
1
,z
2
,...,z
p
}, z
1
=z . Let us construct a periodic
sequence {x
1
,...,x
p
}, such that x
1
= x and x
i
∈ M(z
i
). By Corollary 2, the
sequence {x
i
} is a periodic ε
2
-trajectory for any ε
2
> q +d. Hence the point
x = x
i
lies in Q(ε
2
), i.e. P(d) ⊂ Q(ε
2
). Thus (4) and (6) hold. From the
inclusions Q ⊂ Q(ε
1
) ⊂ P(d) it follows that P(d) is a closed neighborhood of
the chain recurrent set.
(ii)LetH bearbitraryneighborhoodofQ. SinceX isacontinuousmapping
and M is compact, the largest diameter q of the images X(M(i)) tends to 0
as the largest diameter of cells d → 0. Set ε
2
=
3
2
(q +d). We have ε
2
→ 0 as
d→ 0. Because {Q(ε),ε> 0} is a fundamental system of neighborhoods of Q,
there is ε
∗
> 0 such that Q(ε
∗
)⊂H. Take d such that ε
2
=
3
2
(q+d)≤ε
∗
. By
Proposition 1 and the inclusion (6) we have P(d)⊂Q(ε
2
)⊂Q(ε
∗
)⊂H.
(iii) As is easily seen, equality (5) follows from the inclusions (6) and the
equality (1). Note that generally P(d
1
) is not contained in P(d
2
) even though
d
1
<d
2
. As we shall see later, there is an algorithm for constructing a sequence
of imbedded neighborhoods P
1
⊃P
2
⊃... of Q.
Electronic Journal.  67Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 1998
(iv) We prove this proposition by contradiction. Let x ∈ M(k) where k
is a non recurrent vertex. Let {x
1
,...,x
p
} be a periodic ε -trajectory passing
throughx =x
1
andε<r. Considerasequence{z
1
,...,z
p
}suchthatz
1
=k and
x
i
∈ M(z
i
). As ε < r, according to Corollary 4, the sequence {z
i
} is periodic
path on the symbolic image G. Because z
1
=k, the vertex k is recurrent. The
resulting contradiction completes the proof of (iv) and the theorem.  
Theorem 1 leads us to the following inclusions
Q⊂Q(ε
1
)⊂M\T =P(d)\T ⊂P(d)⊂Q(ε
2
), (7)
where ε
1
< r < q +d < ε
2
. By deﬁnition, the set T is closed and T ∩Q = ∅.
Hence, the set P(d)\T is an open neighborhood of the chain recurrent set.
Theorem 1 permits to localize the chain recurrent set without any prelimi-
nary information about dynamic system.
5 Localization of chain recurrent set
In this section the algorithm localizing the chain recurrent set is described.
1. Starting with an initial covering C, the symbolic image G of the map X is
found. The cells of the initial covering may have arbitrarily large diameter
d
0
.
2. The recurrent vertices {i
k
} of the graph G are recognized. Using the
recurrent vertices, a closed neighborhood P ={∪M(i
k
) : i
k
is recurrent}
of the chain recurrent set is found.
3. The cells corresponding to the recurrent vertices{M(i
k
) :i
k
isrecurrent}
are partitioned. For example, the largest diameter of the cells may be
divided by 2. Thus the new covering is deﬁned.
4. The symbolic image G is constructed for the new covering. It should
be noted that the new symbolic image may be constructed on the set
P = {∪M(i
k
) : i
k
is recurrent}. In other words, the cells corresponding
to non recurrent vertices do not participate in the construction of the new
covering and the new symbolic image.
5. Then one goes back to the second step.
Electronic Journal.  68Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 1998
Repeating this partitioning process we obtain a sequence of neighborhoods
P

,P
1
,P

,... of the chain recurrent set Q and a sequence of the largest diam-
eters d
0
,d

,d

,... of cells. The following theorem substantiates the described
algorithm for localization of the chain recurrent set.
Theorem 2 The sequence of sets P

,P

,P

(i) the neighborhoods P

are imbedded one inside the other, i.e.,
P

(ii) if the largest diameters d

Proof. (i) Let C ={M(i)} be a covering of M and G be the symbolic
image for the covering C. Suppose a new covering NC is produced by taking
a partition of C. Denote by NG the symbolic image for NC. For convenience
the cells of the new covering NC are designated as m(i,k) so that
S
k
m(i,k) =
M(i), i.e., the cells {m(i,k) :k = 1,2,...} of the new covering form a partition
of the cell M(i). In this case the vertices of NG are designated as (i,k). Since
X(m(i,k))⊂X(M(i))andm(j,l)⊂M(j), theintersectionX(M(i))∩M(j)6=
∅ provided X(m(i,k))∩m(j,l) 6= ∅. This means that there exists a mapping
from the graph NG to the graph G such that the vertex (i,k) is mapped to the
vertex i and the oriented edge (i,k)→ (j,l) to the oriented edge i→j . From
this it follows that each admissible path on the new graph NG is transformed
to some admissible path on the graph G. Particularly, the periodic paths on
the graph NG are mapped to the periodic paths of the graph G. Hence, the
recurrent vertices of the new symbolic image NG are mapped on the recurrent
vertices of G. Set
P ={∪M(i) :i is recurrent on G},
NP ={∪m(i,k) : (i,k) is recurrent on NG}.
From the previous it follows that NP is a subset of P :NP ⊂P. Applying
this result to each step of the partition, we see that the algorithm gives the
sequence of imbedded neighborhoods P

Let us consider the Van-der-Pol system
x

y

=ε(1−x

)y−x,
where ε = 1,5. It is well known that the chain recurrent set of the Van-
der-Pol system consists of an equilibrium point (0,0) and a periodic orbit. The
system is studied numerically in the squareM = [−3,5;3,5]×[−3,5;3,5]. The
initialcoveringconsistsof49cells,whichare1×1squares. Thesubsequentpar-
titions are sub-divisions into 4 equal squares. Fig.2 presents the neighborhoods

of the chain recurrent set. According to Theorem 2 these
neighborhoods are embedded one inside the other and tend to the equilibrium
point and the periodic orbit. Notice that the initial covering does not separate
the equilibrium point and the periodic orbit. The separation appears at the
ﬁrst partition of P
0
. As seen from Fig.2, the small enough neighborhoods of
the periodic orbit and the equilibrium point are obtained at the sixth step of
the algorithm. A computer program realizing the algorithm described above
has been made in St. Petersburg Technical University, 1991 by A. Moiseev and
the author.
Appendix. An application of the Newton method.
This result was obtained by I.A.Komarchev and the author. The described
algorithm gives the sequence of neighborhoods of periodic trajectories. More-
over, according to Corollary 2 we can ﬁnd the periodic ε-trajectories in each
step of the algorithm. So the problem of existence of true periodic trajectory
Electronic Journal.  70Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 1998
near the periodic ε-trajectory is arisen. In this section we apply the Newton
method to ﬁnd a suﬃcient condition for the existence of a periodic trajectory
near a periodicε-trajectory. Besides that we get an algorithm constructing this
trajectory. Remind brieﬂy the Newton method.
