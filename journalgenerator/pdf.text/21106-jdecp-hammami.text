Abstract. The question proposed in this paper is related to the study of the
preserv ation of uniform h-stability and uniform boundedness of time-v arying non-
linear di erential equations with a perturbation using Gronwall’s inequalities and
Lyapunov’s theory . Moreover, we show the linearization technique for the uniform
h-stability of a nonlinear system and give necessary and su cient conditions for
the global boundedness of perturbed systems. The last part is devoted to the
study of the problem of h-stabilization for certain classes of nonlinear systems.
Some examples and simulations are given to illustrate the main results.
Keywords: Global uniform boundedness, h-stabilization, Linearization system,
Lyapunov function, uniform h-stability .
1 Introduction
The stability theory plays an important role in the area of the  eld of control
systems and automation in engineering. There are di erent types of stability
problems that arise in the study of dynamical systems, see [3, 9, 15] and hasDi er ential Equations and Contr ol Pr o c esses, N. 1, 2021
produced a v ast body of important results. In this work, we will investigate the
concept of h-stability of time-v arying nonlinear systems. This notion has been
presented by M. Pinto in [20, 21]. He introduced it for di erential systems under
some perturbations and extended the study of exponential asymptotic stability to
a v ariety of reasonable systems called h-systems. This notion is an important de-
velopment of the exponential asymptotic stability within one common framework.
The v arious notions of h-stability include several kinds of known stability as uni-
form stability , uniform Lipschitz stability (see [8]) and polynomial stability whose
norm can increase not faster than exponentially . The most useful and general
approach for studying the nonlinear control systems is the theory of Lyapunov.
The relation between Lyapunov functions and v arious types of stability have been
discussed by many authors, see [1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 19]. The general problem of
motion stability includes two methods of stability analysis (the so-called lineariza-
tion method and direct method) was  rst published in 1892. The linearization
technique draws conclusions about a nonlinear system’s local stability around an
equilibrium point from the stability properties of its linear approximation, this
result is proved in [14, 13] for the exponential stability . The direct method is
not restricted to local motion, it determines the stability properties of a nonlinear
system by constructing a scalar energy-like function for the system and examining
the function’s time v ariation, see [12]. T ogether, the linearization method and the
direct method constitute the so-called Lyapunov stability theory .
Nevertheless, there are some systems that may be unstable and yet these sys-
tems may oscillate su ciently near this state that its performance is acceptable.
T o deal with this situation, we need a notion of stability that is more suitable
than Lyapunov stability such a concept is called uniform boundedness. F or the
boundedness as well as the stability , the Lyapunov theory is very useful and the
relation between Lyapunov functions and v arious types of boundedness are very
similar to those between Lyapunov functions and v arious types of stability (see
[6, 14, 16, 17, 18, 24]). It is concerned with quantitative analysis as opposed to
Lyapunov analysis which is qualitative in nature.
The contribution of this paper is to construct a Lyapunov equation and use it to
show that an equilibrium point of a nonlinear system is uniformly h-stable if the
linearization of the system about that point has a uniform h-stable equilibrium
point at the origin. In addition, we use the Lyapunov theory to establish the
global uniform boundedness of nonlinear perturbed systems of di erential equa-
tions. The topic of Laypunov stability of control systems described by a system
of di erential equations was an interesting research area in the past decades (see
[2, 5]). Under appropriate growth conditions on the nonlinear perturbation, a

state control feedback is established based on the global uniform h-stabilizability
of the nominal linear system to h-stabilize the perturbed control system using the
Riccati di erential equation. The remainder of this work is organized as follows.
In Section 2, some preliminary results are summarized and the system descrip-
tion is given. The required assumptions and the statement of the main results are
provided in Section 3. Section 4 is devoted to control applications. Finally , some
numerical examples are given in Section 5 to demonstrate the e ectiveness of the
method put forward. Our conclusion is given in Section 6.
2 General de nitions
W e will use the following notations throughout this paper: R

R

denotes the n-dimensional Euclidean space with appropriate norm k:k:I and
A
T
(t) denote the identity matrix and the transpose of the matrix A(t); respec-
tively .
Consider the nonlinear system:

starting
from the point x

Firstly , let us introduce some basic de nitions which we need in the sequel.
De nition 1 Assume that h : R

is p ositive, c ontinuous and b ounde d
function. The system (1) is said to b e:
1. Uniformly h-stable if ther e exist c onstants c  1 and   > 0; indep endent of

Remark 1 F or some sp e cial c ases of h; theh-stability c oincides with known typ es
of stability:
i) If h(t) =a for a> 0; then the system (1) is stable.
ii) If h(t) = e
  t
for   > 0; then the system (1) is uniformly exp onential ly
stable.
iii) If h(t) =
1
(1+t)

for   1; the system (1) is p olynomial ly stable.
v) If h(t) is a strictly de cr e asing function, such that h(t) tends to 0 when t!
+1; then the origin is uniformly asymptotic al ly stable. Mor e pr e cisely, the
solutions of system (1) c onver ge to the origin (i.e., limsup
t!+1
kx(t)k = 0).
Consider now the linear time-v arying system:
_ x =A(t)x; x(t

whereA( ) isn n matrix whose entries v alues are continuous functions of t2R

The general solution of system (3) is given by:
x(t) = (t;t

; t t  0;
where  (t;t

Lemma 1 (Se e [20]) The system (3) is glob al ly uniformly h-stable if and only if

Remark 2 In line ar systems ther e is the notion of an upp er function which is

the c onsider e d system is h-stable and vic e versa.
Remark 4 Ther e is no r elationship b etwe en the c onc ept of p olynomial stability
and exp onential stability as shown in the fol lowing example.
Example 1 Consider the sc alar e quation:
_ x =

The state tr ansition matrix  (t;t

) is given by
 (t;t

Then, the system (4) is p olynomial ly stable. On the c ontr ary, if we supp ose that
(4) is exp onential ly stable, then ther e exists ff> 0; such that
(t

F or t

not exp onential ly stable.
W e prove now the following lemma which will be used later.

In this work, it is worth to notice the origin is not necessarily an equilibrium point

3 Basic results
3.1 Su cient conditions for uniform boundedness
Lyapunov’s direct method allows us to determine the stability of a system without
explicitly integrating the di erential equation. This method is a generalization of
Electronic Journal. h ttp://di journal.spbu.ru/ 428Di er ential Equations and Contr ol Pr o c esses, N. 1, 2021
the idea that if there is an appropriate function of a system that satis es certain
conditions, then we can deduce the stability of this system. The following theorem
discuss su cient conditions on the global uniform boundedness of solutions of
system (1) by using the Lyapunov’s direct method.

3.2 Converse Theorem
Although Lemma 1 may not be very helpful as a stability test, we will see that it
guarantees the existence of a Lyapunov function for the linear system (3). That
is, if we can  nd a continuously di erentiable, positive, bounded and symmetric
matrix P(t); which is a solution of a di erential equation for some continuous
positive de nite symmetric matrix Q(t); then V(t;x) is a Lyapunov function for
the system. If the matrix Q(t) is chosen to be bounded in addition to being sym-
metric, continuous, positive de nite and if A(t) is continuous and bounded, then
it can be shown that when the origin is uniformly h-stable, there is a solution of
system (3) that possesses the desired properties.
In this section, we state a converse theorem when the origin is a globally uniformly
h-stable equilibrium point of the linear system (3), by de ning a Lyapunov func-
tion that satis es certain properties.
In what follows, we will denote byH the set of the functions h :R

3.3 h-Linearized stability of nonlinear systems
The existence of Lyapunov functions for linear systems per Theorem 2 will now be
used to prove a linearization result and to determine the uniform h-stability of the
nonlinear system. In this section, the result of the preceding section is combined
to obtain one of the most useful results in Lyapunov stability theory namely:
linearization method . The adv antage of this method lies in the fact that,
under certain conditions, it enables one to draw conclusions about a nonlinear

continuously di erentiable and D is a domain that contains the origin. Suppose
that the origin is an equilibrium point of the system, with f(t;0) = 0 and assume
that the Jacobian matrix

is, there exist positive constants L

Therefore, we may approximate the nonlinear system (1) by its linearization in a
small neighborhood of the origin.
The next theorem states Lyapunov’s indirect method for showing the uniform h-
stability of the origin in the non-autonomous case. W e will see that, the uniform
h-stability of the linearized system re ects the uniform h-stability of the nonlinear
system.

of the solutions. W e consider a nonlinear perturbed system and we give su -
cient conditions on the perturbed term. Our conditions are expressed as relations
between the Lyapunov function and the interconnection term.

4 Conclusion
W e have introduced some new conditions for global uniform boundedness of non-
linear systems of di erential equations. A converse theorem has been established
to guarantee the global uniform h-stability of a nonlinear system when its lin-
earization has a global uniform h-stability equilibrium point. One of the main
interests of this paper is that it serves to establish that property for nonlinear
perturbed systems when global uniform h-stability of the nominal system has
been showed with Lyapunov theory . W e have illustrated this use in the global
uniform h-stabilization for control systems. T o guarantee that the closed-loop
system is globally uniformly h-stable, a continuous linear controller has been pro-
vided and su cient conditions has been given. The e ectiveness of the conditions
obtained in this paper has been veri ed in some numerical examples.
