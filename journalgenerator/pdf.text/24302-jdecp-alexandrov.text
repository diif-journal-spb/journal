Abstract. The paper is addressed to the permanence problem for a gener-
alized Lotka–Volterra system modeling interaction of species in a biological
community. The impact of a constant delay and switching of parameters on
the dynamics of the system is taken into account. Our analysis is based on the
Lyapunov direct method. An original construction of a Lyapunov–Krasovskii
functional is proposed. The conditions for the existence of such a functional
are formulated in terms of feasibility of special systems of linear algebraic in-
equalities. It is proven that, under these conditions, the investigated system
is permanent for any constant positive delay and any admissible switching sig-
nal. In addition, a discrete-time counterpart of the considered model is studied
for which the permanence analysis is fulﬁlled, as well. A comparison of the ob-
tainedpermanenceconditionswithknownonesisprovided. Itisshownthatthe

Keywords: population dynamics, ultimate boundedness, permanence, delay,

1 Introduction
Continuous and discrete-time generalized Lotka–Volterra systems are widely
used for modeling species interactions in biological communities [?,?,?,?]. AnDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2024
actual problem that arises when analyzing the dynamics of such systems is to
ﬁnd the conditions ensuring sustainable coexistence of species. A sustainable
biological system should possess the following two important properties: ulti-
mate boundedness and persistence (see [?]). The ﬁrst one means the existence
of a compact domain in the state space of the system such that each motion
enters into it in a ﬁnite time and remains in this domain thereafter. The prop-
ertyofpersistencemeansthatintheprocessofevolutionspeciesdonotdieout,
and, moreover, no matter how small their initial quantities are, starting from
a certain time instant, the quantities of species will exceed some ﬁxed positive
values. If a system admits both of these properties, then it is called permanent
[?].
Permanence conditions are well investigated for biological models described
by ordinary differential or difference equations with constant parameters (see,
e.g., [?,?,?,?,?,?]) and the references therein). However, it is worth noticing
that numerous realistic models should take into account such factors as delay
and switching of operation modes [?, ?, ?, ?]. For instance, the presence of a
delay may be due to the dependence of the growth rates of some species on
the prehistory of others, different rates of reproduction and death processes
for different age groups, etc. On the other hand, switching can be a result
of the impact of such natural and artiﬁcial factors as droughts, rainy seasons,
deforestation, ﬁres, radiation, that cause sudden changes in the internal con-
nections in the biological community and the characteristics of the habitat of
populations.
The presence of delays and switching signiﬁcantly complicates the perma-
nence analysis. Some suﬃcient conditions of permanence for time-delay Lotka–
Volterra type systems were obtained in [?, ?, ?, ?], whereas, in [?, ?, ?, ?], per-
manence of biological models with switching of parameters was studied. How-
ever,therearefewresultsonpermanenceforsystemscontainingbothswitching
and delays (see, e.g., [?, ?, ?, ?]).
In particular, in [?], certain classes of continuous and discrete-time general-
izedLotka–Volterrasystemswithdelaysandswitchingwereinvestigated. Using
special constructions of Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals, conditions were de-
rived providing that the considered systems are permanent for any constant
delay and any admissible switching law. These conditions were formulated in
terms of feasibility of auxiliary linear inequalities.
In the present paper the same classes of systems are studied. New con-
structions of Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals will be proposed. Our objective

is to prove that, with the aid of these functionals, less conservative permanence
conditions can be obtained than those presented in [?].
2 Statement of the problem
In what follows,R denotes the ﬁeld of real numbers andR

of n-tuples of real numbers with the Euclidean norm k k. Let R

n
j x   0g and intR
n

be the interior

. A matrix is said to be nonnegative if all its entries are nonnegative. A

a given number τ > 0, C([ τ,0],intR

Taking into account the biological meaning of the model, we will consider
thesystem(1)inintR
n
+
. Letinitialfunctionsφ(ξ)forsolutionsx(t) = x(t,t
0
,φ)
of (1) belong to the space C([ τ,0],intR
n

) and, for a solution x(t), x
t
be the
restriction of the solution to the segment [t τ,t], i.e., x
t
: ξ 7! x(t+ξ) for
ξ2 [ τ,0].
According to the standard assumptions (see [?, ?]), we consider the case
where functions f
i
(x
i
) possess the following properties:
1) f
i
(x
i
) are continuous and locally Lipschitz for x
i
  0;
2) f

3) f

Remark 1. From these properties it follows that intR

is an invariant set
for (1) [?].

Our objective is to determine the conditions ensuring permanence of (1) for
any constant positive delay and any admissible switching law. In addition, we
will investigate the permanence problem for a discrete-time counterpart of the
model (1).

Under Assumption 1, conditions of permanence for (1) were obtained in [?]
on the basis of the Lyapunov direct method. A common Lyapunov–Krasovskii

then the system (1) is permanent for any positive delay and any admissible
switching law. Here and in what follows vector inequalities are understood
componentwise.
Inthispaper, wewillproposeanotherconstructionofLyapunov–Krasovskii
functional. To do this, we will use the approach that was ﬁrst suggested in [?]
for the stability analysis of delay-free switched linear systems and was later
extended in [?, ?] to some classes of linear and nonlinear time-delay switched
systems. We will show that, using the new functional, less conservative perma-
nence conditions can be derived than those found in [?].

Remark 3. It is worth noticing that, under Assumption 1, the conditions
of Theorem 1 are valid if and only if one of the following conditions is satisﬁed:
(a) there exists a vector η > 0 such that
(A
(s)
+B
(s)
)η < 0, s = 1,...,N,
(b) there exists a vector ζ > 0 such that

ζ < 0, s,r = 1,...,N.

Really, in the case (a) the conditions of Theorem 1 are fulﬁlled for suﬃciently
large values of ν, whereas in the case (b), the conditions of Theorem 1 are
fulﬁlled for suﬃciently small values of ν. However, in some problems, e.g.,
estimation of ultimate boundedness domain, estimation of convergence rate of
solutions, analysis of the impact of external disturbances, etc., to derive less
conservative results, it is useful to have opportunity for an appropriate choice
oftheparameter ν (see, forinstance, [?]). ThepresentedstatementofTheorem
1 permits us to determine admissible domain for this parameter.

It is worth noticing that, in numerous cases, discrete-time models are more

In [?], it has been proven that if Assumptions 1, 2 are satisﬁed, the system
(3) admits a positive solution and the value of h is suﬃciently small, then (8)
is permanent for any positive delay and any switching law. Our objective is to
show that, with the aid of a discrete-time counterpart of the functional (6), the
permanence can be guaranteed under less conservative conditions imposed on
the coeﬃcients a
(s)
ij
and b
(s)
ij
.
Theorem 2 Let the conditions of Theorem 1 and Assumption 2 be fulﬁlled.
Then there exists h
0
> 0 such that the system (8) is permanent for any h 2
(0,h
0
), any constant positive delay and any switching law.

5 Discussion
In this paper, using a special construction of Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional
anditsdiscrete-timecounterpart,newpermanenceconditionsforsomecontinu-
ousanddiscrete-timebiologicalmodelswithdelaysandswitchingareobtained.
Let us show that these conditions are less conservative than those found in [?].
Really, if the system (3) admits a positive solution, then there exist vectors
η > 0, ζ > 0 and numbers h
1
,h
2
such that h
2
< 0 and inequalities (4), (5)
are satisﬁed. Thus, the condition νh
1
+h
2
< 0 is fulﬁlled for suﬃciently small
values of ν.
On the other hand, consider the case where n = N = 2,
A
(1)
=
 
 2 0
1  2
!
, A
(2)
=
 
 5 0

,
B

1 0

, B
(2)

1 2
0 4
!
.
We obtain
A
(1)
+B
(2)
=
 
 1 2
1 2
!
.
Hence, the system (3) does not admit positive solutions.
It can be easily veriﬁed that the inequalities h
1
 
p
5 3, h
2
  2
p
2 are
necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the existence of positive vectors η and ζ
satisfyingthesystems(4)and(5), respectively. Thus, if h
1
=
p
5 3, h
2
= 2
p
2
and ν > 2
p
2//(3 
p
5), then νh
1
+h
2
< 0.
As a result, we obtain that theorems from the paper [?] are not applicable
to systems of the forms (1) and (8) with the considered matrices, whereas
Theorems 1 and 2 from the present work guarantee that these systems are
permanent.

An interesting direction for further research is an extension of the obtained
results to switched generalized Lotka–Volterra models with variable delays.
