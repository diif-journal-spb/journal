Abstract
In this paper, a class of uncertain linear polytopic systems with distributed time vary-
ing delays is studied. By using an improved parameter dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii
functional approach and linear matrix inequality technique, delay-dependent su cient
conditions for exponential stability of the system are  rst established in terms of Mondie-
Kharitonov type's linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Numerical example is presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed conditions.
Keywords: polytopic uncertainty; exponential stability; distributed delays; linear matrix
inequality.

1 Introduction
The stability analysis of linear time-delay systems is a topic of great practical
importance, which has attracted a lot of interest over the decades (see e.g. [1, 2,
3, 5]). Also, systems uncertainties arise from many sources such as unavoidable
approximation, data errors and aging of systems and so the stability issue of
uncertain time delay systems has been investigated by many researchers (seeDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2010
[6, 8, 9]), where the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method is certainly used
as the main tool.
Recently, the stability analysis of linear system with polytopic type uncer-
tainties has also received much attention (see e.g. [4, 8, 10]). However, the
distributed delays are not considered in the mentioned papers. In practice,
systems with distributed delays have many important applications in various
areas (see [2, 3]). Theoretically, systems with distributed delays are much more
complicated, especially for the case where the system matrices belong to some
convex polytope. To the best of our knowledge, so far, no result on the stability
for uncertain linear polytopic systems with distributed delays is available in the
literature. This motivates our present investigation.
In this paper, we develop the robust stability problem for linear uncertain
polytopic systems with discrete and distributed time varying delays. The novel
feature of the results obtained in this paper is twofold. First, the system con-
sidered in this paper is convex polytopic uncertain subjected to discrete and
distributed time varying delays. Second, by employing an improved parameter
dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and linear matrix inequality tech-
nique, delay dependent su cient conditions for the exponential stability of the
system are obtained in terms of the Mondi  e-Kharitonov type's LMI conditions
[7]. The approach also allows to compute simultaneously the two bounds that
characterize the exponential stability rate of the solution.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents notations, de nitions
and a well-known technical proposition needed for the proof of the main result.
Delay dependent exponential stability conditions of the system and numerical
example is presented in Section 3. The paper ends with conclusions and cited
references.

Remark 3.2. As a consequent of theorem 3.1, if   = 0 and D
