Abstract
We consider the 3-dimensional (3-D) model of the massive particles, rep-
resented as the rest-mass energy-density wave-packets, which is analog to the
common physical objects which we experiment in our every-day life. This new
theoryisacompletionofthestatisticalQM(wherethewavefunctionsrepresent
the ensemble of measurements) by the QM theory for the individual particles.
Then we provide an analysis of particle internal dynamic during their strong
excitations caused by the sharp breaking of the 3-D vacuum symmetry dur-
ing particle inertial propagation. Hence for that we use the three conservation
laws for the compressive uids: energy/matter, momentum, and internal en-
ergy. Consequently,weshowthenewmethodforcomputationofthecylindrical
expansion (radial expansion w.r.t. the direction of particle propagation) of a
massive elementary particle during an inertial propagation in a vacuum with a
stable spherically symmetric rest-mass energy density distribution (in particle
hydrostatic equilibrium), before an impact with a large and massive obstacle
(barrier). This is used to explain also the double-slit experiments with massive
particle as, for example, an individual electron. We also propose a practical
method to test the QM completion based on these experiments.

1 Introduction
Quantum mechanics, based on the Schr odinger equation is an epistemic sta-
tistical theory, here denominated as Statistical Quantum Mechanics (SQM), to
differentiateitfromthenewpartoftheontologicalquantumtheory,providedin
[6] and [7], denominated Individual particles Quantum Mechanics (IQM). Both
of them are necessary components of the quantum theory, as are the Classi-
cal Mechanics for Individual objects (ICM),based on the Newton equations,
Hamiltonian-Jacobi equations or the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion of in-
dividual objects) and the Statistical Classical Mechanics (SCM), based on the
Liouville equations.
IntheIQMtheorythereisadeeperspeci cationofthestateoftheparticle,and
in this approach to completion provided in [6], these states are speci ed by the
energy-density distributions of a given particle in the Minkowski time-space.
Such an ontic state, also not fully accessible (non fully observable by the mea-
surements, and/or with non accessible small compacti ed higher-dimensions
for the electric charge and spin, for example), has to represent the complete
description of an individual elementary particle, in order to be able to compute
from it all properties of a particle as its rest-mass, position, speed, momentum,
total energy, etc...
The standard quantum theory with the probabilistic wavefunctions and their
statistical ensemble interpretation is based on the classical concept of a point-
like particle and do not have the theory able to describe an individual particle
with its trajectory and given momentum and energy in any  xed instance of
time. Because of that as noted by Einstein it was an incomplete theory, differ-
ently from the classic mechanics which has both statistical theory (for example
the thermodynamic of a gas) and theory for each individual object (Newton,
Euler-Lagrange equations for the motion of an individual object). In the pro-
posedcompletionofquantumtheory[6]instead,anindividual massiveparticle's
wave-packet (described by the complex scalar wave-packets 	 in what follows)
always occupies a nonzero 3-D volume. It holds also for bosons when they be-
come unstable after an initial 'space explosion' and, consequently, assume the
massive particle behavior and a  nite but non-zero matter/energy-density vol-
umeinopen3-Dspace. Hence, inthisIQMtheory[6]forindividualelementary
particles based on energy-density wave-packets, the point-like particles are only
the stable-state bosons when they propagate with speed of light in the vacuum,
andwiththeirenergy-densitydistributedinhighercompacti eddimensions[7].
This new IQM theory for individual particles is able to compute the spectra

of the rest-masses of the particles which is not possible to obtain with the sta-
tistical SQM theory. Moreover, it was demonstrated that this quantum theory
completion is conservative w.r.t. the theoretical and experimental results of the
statistical SQM theory. However, we need also some experimental tests for the
validity of this IQM theory for individual particles and here we provide them
by double-slit experiments for the massive particles (we recall the fact that, for
example, the string theory still did not provide an experimental method for the
validation of that IQM theory).
It was shown [3, 4, 5, 6] that, generally, any massive particle can be de ned in
the Minkowski time-space by the complex wave-packet

In the assumption [6] of the topology of the matter of an elementary massive
particle, the wave-packet do not undergo a spreading, also when it changes its
matter density distribution (i.e., its energy-density  
m
), and tends to its stable
stationarysphericallysymmetricdistributionduringinertialpropagationinthe
vacuum. That is, the matter has some internal self-gravitational autocohesive
force analogously to the peace of perfect uid

instance of time, the 3-D space topology of particle's matter distribution, and
consequently its compressible energy-density

is simply connected, closed,
continuous and differentiable.

the theory of massive elementary particle (in PART I), it is assumed that the
particle's bodies undergoing the action of external forces are perfectly elastic,
i.e., that they resume their initial form (in its hydrostatic equilibrium) com-

We consider that the matter of an particle is a perfect uid, that is, have no shear stresses, viscosity, or
heat conduction. Perfect uids are often used in general relativity to model idealized distributions of matter,
such as the interior of a star or an isotropic universe. In general relativity, a uid solution is an exact solution
of the Einstein  eld equation in which the gravitational  eld is produced entirely by the mass, momentum, and
stress density of a uid. In astrophysics, uid solutions are often employed as stellar models. Consequently, by
the assumption that particle's material body is a perfect uid, we obtain the full physical uni cation of the QM
with universe.

pletely after removal of forces.
The elastic body of an elementary particle has no any molecular internal struc-
ture and hence the particle's matter is homogeneous and continuously dis-
tributed over its volume so that the smallest element cut from the body pos-
sesses the same speci c physical properties as the whole body. That is, it is
assumed that the particle's body is isotropic, i.e., that the elastic properties are
the same in all spatial directions. Moreover, we have no any thermodynamic
dissipation inside particle's body during its elastic deformations, that is, we
have no thermal losses of particle's internal energy during such elastic deforma-
tions caused by the external forces: the particle's kinetic energy converted into
its internal elastic potential energy V during elastic deformations have no any
side-effects of thermal losses.
The essence of elasticity is the reversibility. Forces applied to an elastic ma-
terial transfer energy into the material which, upon yielding that energy to
its surroundings, can recover its original shape. Elastic energy occurs when
objects are compressed and stretched, or generally deformed in any manner.
For a massive elementary particle it corresponds to energy stored by changing
the internal forces of particle's hydrostatic equilibrium based on particle's self-
gravitational force.
Such properties of the particle's body differentiate it from the structural ma-
terials composed by the molecular structures as all material object used in our
every-day practice. Each massive elementary particle satis es the following
conservation laws:
1. Conservation of the matter/energy law: Analogously to the Euler  rst
equation of uid dynamics (continuity equation), which represents the conser-
vation of mass, here we have the analog equation for the conservation of matter
(that is of the particle's rest-mass energy):

Here, instead, we will consider the same radial (i.e., cylindrical) extension for
the massive particles, and to explain why in the the double-slit experiments
for the massive particle's, described in [6] (Section 4.6.1) this particle's radial
"explosion" in from of the large massive barrier transforms, in an in nitesi-
mally short interval of time, its spherically symmetric micro body-density into
a very large macro-disk able to cover both slits contemporarily and to permit
the propagation of the particle's body density trough both slits contemporarily.
It was explained [8] why in the stable particle's states, during an inertial prop-
agation with the constant speed

of an massive elementary particle demonstrated that the body of this particle

. So, we will use other two conservation
laws for the elementary particles, provided in [8]:

we will consider that there is no any signi cant viscosity inside particle's body

This real physical material substance generates a curved time-space curvature inside and around it (the
micro-island curvature), but this material substance can not be simply 'generated by time-space curvature'.

so that this equation can not be used to solve the dynamic phenomena of the
perturbations of particle's hydrostatic equilibrium. However, they are useful
in order to understand the internal dynamics of the particle's rest-mass energy

which is the 'third Euler's equation' (obtained a century later).
Note that the speci c internal energy e keeps account of the gains and losses of
energy of the system that are due to changes in its internal state. The inter-
nal energy of a given state of a massive elementary particle cannot be directly
measured.
However, it is fundamental concept which explains the principles of 'internal
energy V', introduced [6] (in De nition 5 for internal dynamic assumption) and
described in Section 2.6 in [6], dedicated to the phenomena of 'virtual particles'

this breaking of 3-D symmetry produces the changing of particle's body shape
[6]). V is a potential internal energy (based on this speci c internal energy e
in the equation above) used, for example, during the spatial expansion of the
particle's body (during strong excitations) when has to be spent some energy
against the autocohesive self-gravitational force inside particle's body which

In next section, we provide an ideal model of cylindrical expansion of a massive
elementary particle. Then, in Section 3, we provide the dynamics of this radial
explosion which generates the large radius of a disc-shape of particle's body in
an in nitesimal interval of time able to cover both slits contemporarily in the

double-slit experiments. The application of this radial explosion of the massive
particles to the double-slit experiments is presented in the last section, and is
provided a method for experimental test of this phenomena and hence of the
completion (for the individual particles) of the quantum theory by the IQM.
2 Amodelofcylindricalexpansionofanelementarypar-
ticle
Let us consider the case of the double-slit experiments with the relatively low-
energy electrons, and not the high-energy electrons which would be absorbed
by the barrier. In fact, the high-energy electrons have very high kinetic en-
ergy, that is, the velocity of propagation, so that the impact with the large
massive boundary would be to much fast in order to have enough time for the
signi cant radial expansion before electron's impact with barrier. Thus, such
a very high-energy electron will have impact only with one massive particle in
the barrier and hence only two possibilities: if electron's energy is not too much
highthentheComptoneffectinsidethebarrierwouldhappenandthiselectron,
after a number of collisions with the particles in this massive barrier, will lose
its kinetic energy and remain inside the barrier; otherwise, with too much high
energy, the collision with another particle inside the barrier would produce the
fusion (absorption) with this particle and possible generation of another new
particles.
Thus, we consider only the low-energy electrons that propagate with relatively
small velocity toward the barrier. So, when this particle becomes very close to
thisbarrierthentheprocessoftheradialexpansionbegins,becauseitsprevious
inertialpropagationintheconditionoftheperfect3-Dspacevacuumsymmetry
now is interrupted by the sharp breaking of this 3-D space symmetry, caused
by the large massive barrier in front of it. Thus, we have that the boundary
conditionsforthiselectron(forthedifferentialequation(4)ofitsmatter/energy
conservation law) and its local micro-island curvature around electron's body,
generated by its self-gravitational force, are now drastically changed.
From the fact that the speed of this electron toward the barrier is not enor-
mously high, the interval of time, from the beginning of particle's radial expan-
sion and the physical impact (of such a frontally-enlarged electron) with the
massive particles in the barrier, would be suﬃciently long for particle's radial
expansion. Hence, the enlarged frontal surface of the electron, which will have
during the physical impact with the barrier, will cover an enormous number of
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru 63Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2019
massive particles in the barrier's surface (if the radial expansion of electron's
frontal surface is extremely fast - what we have to verify in next). Notice that
such a low-energy electron will also preserve the elastic properties during the
interactions with the barrier (i.e., the elastic compression of its matter-density)
during the frontal collision with the particles in the barrier, which changes its
internal potential energy V like in the Hooke's law (see at [6], page 108, after
Example 11). From the fact that this radial (w.r.t. the direction of propaga-
tion)diskoftheenlargedelectron, parallelwiththebarrier, willhaveaphysical
impact with the thousands of particles belonging to the external surface of the
barrier, we will not have the Compton effect, but only a distribution of par-
ticle's impact over a large surface of the barrier (in which the impulse-impact
with any single particle would be relatively small). Hence, the electron's body
will only continue its radial expansion over the external surface of the barrier,
by transferring its initial kinetic energy into a (negative) internal potential en-
ergy V (the decrement of the positive kinetic part of energy E is represented
by decrement of E +V, that is, by increment of jVj where V is negative, so
that V effectively decreases; this decrease of kinetic energy explains the de-
crease of particle's speed) which would change its internal gradient-pressure

up to the moment when particle's disc-body would  nd in the barrier some slit

case, the electron will be arrested on the surface of the barrier and then the
internal negative energy V will be reversed now into the positive kinetic energy
(hence now E +V will be incremented, by decrement of jVj (of the negative
V and hence V effectively increases); the increase of kinetic energy explains
the increase of particle's velocity), and hence will begin the process of (perfect)
reection of this electron from the barrier. In the moment when all internal
potentialenergyistransformedintoparticle'skineticenergy, wewillhaveagain
a stable electron (in its hydrostatic equilibrium) which now propagates in the
opposite direction with the same constant speed as the speed before the impact
with the barrier.
Let us consider an inertial propagation of a massive particle along the axis x,
toward a large massive barrier up to the time instance t = 0, during which it

where is impossible to separate the variables r and x.
Hence, we can only use the following separation  
m
(t;x;r) = T(t)R(x;r),
where T(t) is a dimensionless function while R(x;r) is a 3-D energy density
function [Joule=cm

T

(x;r) where u
T
(t)  0 is a func-
tion in [sec

] and u
R
(x;r) is a 1-D function [cm](which express a distance).
The function T(t) is the time evolution of the rest-mass energy density and
hence we  x its initial value at t = 0 by T(0) = 1. We  x also u
T
(0) = 0, with
u
T
(t) > 0 for 0 < t < △t where △t is the short time-interval during which
an 3-D symmetry breaking generates this perturbation which transforms the
hydrostatic-equilibrium sphere with the radius r
0
into a growing (also macro-
scopical) disk but microscopically wide (the thickness of this disk is 2r
0
, with
 r

).
Notice that u
T
(t) is not the time evolution of the radial velocity, and also
u
R
(x;r) is not a velocity; only their product represents the radial velocity.
Thus, at t = 0 we have still the hydrostatic equilibrium with

we consider that the radial velocity u
r
(t;x;r) = u
T
(t)u
R
(x;r) is determined
by the particles speed toward the barrier and by the dimension of the barrier
which causes this 3-D symmetry breaking perturbation, so that other dynamic
variables can be expressed by using u
T
(t) and u
R
(x;r).
From the left-hand side of the equation above, we obtain the following solution
for the time-dependent component of the energy-density distribution T(t) > 0
for any t  0:
T(t) = e
k
∫

(11)
Thus, fromthefactthatallfunctionsattheright-handsideofthisequationare
positive and t   0, in order to obtain that the T(t) component of the energy
density diminishes with time during particle's expansions (because the total
rest-mass energy is invariant), we conclude that:
  During the radial expansion, when u
R
(x;r)  0, we must have that k < 0.
The energy density diminishes with time in any point inside the particle's
body with the disk radius r
0
(t;x) that increases with time;
  During the radial compression, when u
R
(x;r)   0, we must have that
k > 0. The energy density increases with time in any point inside the
particle's disk body with radius r
0
(t;x) which decreases with time.
Remark: the valuejkj is proportional to the force of the impact of the particle
with this barrier which causes this radial-expansion perturbation from the par-
ticle'shydrostaticequilibrium(micro-spherewithanextremelysmallradiusr
0
),
i.e.,proportionaltotheparticle'sspeed. Withagreaterspeedwehaveagreater
kinetic particle's energy, which can be transformed into a negative internal po-
tential energy V used for radial expansion against particle's self-gravitational
force, so that the radial speed ofparticles radial expansion wouldbegreater. In
fact, agreatervalueofjkjwouldproducestrongerchangesof T(t)(whichrepre-
sentsthetime-evolutionoftheparticle'srest-massmatter/energydensity),that
is, would produce a faster expansion of the particle's disk and hence its frontal
boundary would cover a greater surface of the barrier in a smaller interval of
time. Consequently, k is a fundamental real parameter, which represents the
strength of this impact-force caused by the 3-D symmetry breaking during an
inertial propagation of the particle, and will be considered in what follows as a
given (non derived) parameter in all equations.
 
From the right-hand side of equation (10), we obtain the following dependence

the necessities of particle's "radial explosions" in extremely excitations during

[8]. From the fact that we
have the extension only in the radial direction (w.r.t. to the particle's direction
of propagation), this dynamics will transform a micro-spherical particle's body

into a kind of a disk with an irregular border, because the expansion velocity
varies with x for each r

  x  r

, so that the border surface of this cylindric
form is not at as in a standard disk.
Let us consider now these dynamic changes of this hydrostatic equilibrium den-
sity during the strong 3-D symmetry breaking perturbations:
Proposition 2 Let r

(t;x) be the radial expansion of the particle's disk, for
a given x such that  r

and time-instance t   0, with r

2
and hence with the radius of the particle's sphere in its hydrostatic
equilibrium r
0
(0;0) = r

. Then, the dynamic components of the particle's den-
sity and radial velocity time-changing are given by:
T(t) = (

and hence from K =

All equations obtained in the proposition above, expressed by the value of
the expansion radius of the particle's disk r
0
(t;x), are obtained from the mat-
ter/enetgy conservation law (continuity equation), and we need another equa-
tion to compute r
0
(t;x). Hence, for the computation of the time evolution of
the particle's body radius r
0
(t;x) during its radial expansion/compression we
have to use the momentum conservation law.
The particle's dynamics during the 3-D symmetry breaking, caused by the im-
pact with a large massive barrier, represents the changing of the internal force
inside particle's body generated by the gradient of the internal pressure,

TheLemma1,basedonthemomentumconservationlaw,isintendedtobeused
for the derivation of the disk expansion r
0
(t;x), and it can be seen if we replace
T(t) and u
T
(t) from the equation (17) into the equation (22). However, this
complex method will be presented in more details in the next section, where
will be also analyzed the methods, results and provided the conclusions.
Let us  nish this section by considering now, from the physical point of view,
a complete cycle of particle's auto-equilibrium dynamics when a particle passes
from an inertial propagation with a stationary distribution  
m
=
K
p
 
into an
explosive energy-density cylindrical disk expansion caused by 3-D symmetry
breaking with enormously large massive barrier without any slit (the case of
the barrier with the slits will be considered in the next section). Then, after
someintervaloftime, whenallkineticenergy(whichtheparticlehadbeforethe
physical impact onto this barrier) is spent for the radial expansion and hence
when this disk expansion is interrupted, now, after △t, becomes the inverse
process of the disk compression (now with k > 0). Now, during this com-
pression, the internal potential energy transforms into the kinetic energy but
with opposite direction of the particle's propagation, because it cant enter into
the massive barrier (case of the perfect elastic reection from the barrier), and
hence this particle again returns into the inertial stationary propagation:

ing caused by ideally in nite barrier orthogonal to the particle's trajec-
tory) with conversion of the particle's kinetic energy into its internal
potential energy. This internal potential energy increments the internal
pressure force  
@P
@r
which now becomes enormously greater than parti-
cles self-gravitational force. So, now begins the process of particle's ra-
dial expansion (parallel to the surface of this barrier) with the velocity

0
and
the plane x = r

. In this case, at the end of this expansion (when all
particle's kinetic energy is converted into its internal potential energy V
so that we have the complete rest of this macro-disk of the particle at the
barrier surface, with r
0
(△t;0) enormously bigger than r
0
), we obtain that
the density of the particle's body diminished and becomes equal to

During this period of the expansion (when k < 0), the  rst term on the
right-hand side of the internal force 
@P
@r
(in the equation (22)) is positive
as well. However, at the end of this time interval, i.e., at t = △t, when
the internal force of expansion disappears, also the expansion acceleration
disappears, that is

nal force becomes
  !
F(△t;x;r) =

much more smaller than at
an instance of time before △t. Consequently, the self-gravitational force
becomes greater than this internal pressure and hence now begins the pro-
cess of particles compression (with the speed u

disk compression. During compression, the previously accumulated inter-
nal potential energy now converts into the kinetic energy (which was zero

from the barrier. The energy-density distribution of the particle at t =△t
is given by (25). Consequently, we have that during the expansion (for

increases with time. That is, the particle's density now increases dur-
ing this compression phase. So, for t > △t, T(t) > 1 and hence r

as expected.
So, now we have an inverse process, that is, a compression of the parti-
cle's body up to the radius r
0
when the distribution of the energy-density
again becomes time-invariant  
m
(t;r) =

. Thus, we obtain again a
stationary particle's state in which the internal forces become constant in
each point inside particle's body and hence the internal energy-ow ve-
locity

r
becomes zero again. Thus, we return again to
particle's hydrostatic equilibrium
4
, as it was in the initial moment t = 0
before the particle's expansion caused by an acceleration, with the same
(but in opposite direction) speed of this particle. In fact, the whole in-
ternal potential energy V, which at t =△t was equal to particle's initial
kinetic energy before the impact with the barrier, now is again completely
returned to particle's kinetic energy without any kind of energy dissipa-
tion, as explained from the perfect elastic properties of particle's perfectly
uid body.
In the time instance t = △t, we have the rest of the radial expansion, be-
cause the whole kinetic energy of the particle now is converted into the in-
ternal potential energy used to extend the particle's body against particle's
internal self-gravitational forces, Thus, now we can use the conservation of in-
ternal energy law (6) which, from the fact that

In next section, we will consider the method for computation of the radial
extension of particle's disk r
0
(t;x) in order to analyze for which conditions
this radial expansion would generate a very large macro-dimensional disk (in
an extremely short interval of time  t), able to reach both slits in the large
massivebarrier,andtopropagatetroughthemtoreachtheothersideofbarrier,
by generating the typical effects of the double-slit experiments [6] also in the
massive particles cases.
4 Conclusion: Application to double-slit experiments: a
test of the IQM theory
The radial expansion of the particle's disk-body for a given x, such that r
0
 
x  r
0
, and time-instance t  0, is given by r
0
(t;x), with r
0
(0;x) =
√
r
2
0
 x
2
,
so that r
0
(0;0) = r
0
is the radius of the particle's sphere in its hydrostatic
equilibrium. In this section, we will analyze the methods for the computation
of this dynamic disk extension, which is not so important for the case of the
perfect reection of the particle from the large massive barrier, as explained
at the end of the previous section, but is fundamental in consideration of the
double-slit experiments. We consider the massive barrier with two slits divided
by the macroscopic distance d, enormously greater than the radius r
0
of the
massive elementary particle in its hydrostatic equilibrium (as it was examined
in [6], Section 4.6.1, but without providing the method of computation of the
radial extension of the massive particle when it comes near to the barrier,
approximatively in the center between these two slits).
This method for computation of r
0
(t;x) is necessary in order to demonstrate
mathematically that it is possible to obtain the real phenomena of the radial
explosion of the massive particle such that, after extremely short interval of
time  t (from particles hydrostatic equilibrium, in the time-instance t = 0), we
can have that r
0
( t;x) >
d
2
>> r
0
and hence the possibility that particle's body
passes contemporarily trough both slits.
In effect, from the equation (17) in Proposition 2, we have that both time-
dependent functions T(t) and u
T
(t) (the dynamic components of the particle's
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru 76Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 2, 2019
densityandradialvelocitytime-changing)doesnotdependonx(whichappears
in the right-hand sides of (17)), so that we can rewrite the equation (17) for
the simplest case when x = 0:
T(t) = (

)
3=2
  1; and u
T
(t) = 
3
2k

r
0
(t;0)
dr
0
(t;0)
dt
  0 (29)
Consequently, by dividing the  rst equations in (17) and (29) with T(t), we
obtain:
r
2
0
(t;x) = r
2
0
(t;0) x
2
  r
2
0
(t;0) (30)
Thus, we have the maximum of extension of the disk in the plane x = 0, which
passes through particle's barycenter (the middle of the disk) and, moreover,
the particle's disk has the form of the part of the sphere with radius r
0
(t;0)
between the two plains x = r
0
and x = r
0
. Thus, for r
0
(t;0) >> r
0
the border
of this disk will be practically at surface during fast radial propagation.
If we repeat now the same division of the second equations in (17) and (29)
with u
T
(t), we obtain:
dr

(t;x)
dt

r

(31)
So, also the radial velocity of the disk expansion, for any r
0
  x  r
0
, can be
obtained from its radial velocity at x = 0 and its radial expansion r
0
(t;0), such
that the minimal velocity of particle's radial expansion is just in the particle's
barycenter plane x = 0 and maximal for jxj = r
0
, i.e., in the front and back
surfaces of particle's disk.
Thus, it is enough to  nd a more simple method for the computation, only of
the maximal disk extension in the center of the disk (for x = 0), that is, the
computation of r
0
(t;0). Consequently, we can simplify the equations in Lemma
1, obtained from the momentum conservation law, as follows:
Corollary 1 The equation (22) for the boundary surface of the particle's disk
in the plane x = 0, when r = r

So, after more than 7 years of the development of the completion of QM, by the
missed part of theory dedicated to an individual particle (and not to an ensem-
blewithitsstatisticaltheoryandprobabilitydensitiesbasedontheSchr odinger
equation and its relativistic Dirac's extension), in which it is provided also the
calculation of the mass-spectrum (Section 2.3 in [6]) of the elementary particles
(whichcannotbeobtainedfromthestatistical-probabilistictheoryofStandard
Model), we are now able to verify experimentally this new part of the QM for
the individual massive elementary particles, described as complex 3-D wave-
packets 	 such that  
m
= 		 is the rest-mass energy density.
In fact, we can not measure this rest-mass energy density (it is a hidden, non-
observable variable) and we can not observe the internal speed of this particle's
density during the particle's accelerations. This new theory in a number of sig-

ni cant examples [6] is in accordance with the results of the current ensemble-
based statistical QM, and it holds also for the famous double-slit example
5
.
However, the practical examples of 'how we can test this new theory by labora-
toryexperiments'arenotprovidedin[6],becausethemathematicalelaboration
of the physical process of a radial explosion into a macro-disk of a massive ele-
mentary particle in front of the barrier was not developed in physically enough
details, but only up to a mathematical level which permits the de nition of the
new non-Poincare group of transformations ([6], Section 1.3), which is a more
speci c algebraic QM theoretical issue. In this paper, we present in details this
missed physical part, which is not strictly a (standard) QM issue, but more ap-
propriate to the classical (and deterministic) mechanics, that is, to the general
theory of uids [1]
6
with the fundamental difference that the particle's body is
not structured as a molecular-composed uids but as a perfect uid.
It is well known that Landau went to Copenhagen on 8 April 1930 to work
at the Niels Bohr's Institute for Theoretical Physics. He stayed there until 3
May of the same year. After the visit, Landau always considered himself a
pupil of Niels Bohr and Landau's approach to physics was greatly inuenced
by Bohr (he worked also with Wolfgang Pauli, another Copenhagen's school
follower). It is something mysterious for me that he was one of the greatest
scientists just in the classical mechanics (theory of uids in this case relevant
to my work), as Schr odinger, and hence he received the 1962 Nobel Prize in
Physics for his development of a mathematical theory of superuidity, but it
seems that he did not tried to overcome the Bohr's Copenhagen-interpretation
of QM by completing the QM and unify it with classical mechanics as wanted
Albert Einstein (and I proposed in [6]: so-called Landau quasiparticles can be
physically explained as unstable fermions whose part of their kinetic energy is
converted into an internal potential energy (negative if particle is spherically
extended from its hydrostatic equilibrium, positive if it is compressed [8]), so
that their mass can differ substantially from that of a normal fermion). Prob-
ably because he did not work never with Einstein, Max Planck or Schr odinger,
the main opposition to the Copenhagen's interpretation? Hope to  nd in next
to this open question.
However, in the mathematical framework developed in this work, we are now
5
Richard Feynman [2] was fond of saying that all of quantum mechanics can be gleaned from carefully
thinking through the implications of this single experiment
6
In 1924, Landau moved to the main centre of Soviet physics at the time: the Physics Department of
Leningrad State University (Saint Petersburg University, great Russian school, heredity of great Leonhard
Euler, which theory of uids I used here; Euler arrived in Saint Petersburg on 17 May 1727, invited by Peter
the Great to improve education in Russia and to close the scienti c gap with Western Europe in that historical
period) where he dedicated himself to the study of theoretical physics, graduating in 1927.

able to de ne the following experimental tests for this new IQM theory of an
individual particle:
1. In order to obtain the double-slit interference for the electrons, the kinetic
energy of each individual test electron must be inside an interval of values
[E
min
;E
max
]. ThevaluesofthekineticenergylowerthanE
min
aretoomuch
low in order to obtain enough internal potential energy able to expand the
particle's disk over both slits.
That is, with such a low kinetic energies we would have that r
0
(△t;0) <
d
2
,
where d is the distance between two slits in the massive barrier. The
kinetic energy greater than E
max
will not produce the effect of enough
radial extension, because the particle would have a very high speed toward
the barrier and hence the time for the radial extension (when particle
is in nitesimally near to the barrier) would be too much short for the
signi cant radial extension. In a such situation, an electron would have
the direct collision with some elementary particle inside the barrier and
would be blocked inside this barrier.
2. For a greater distance between two slits, the value E
min
must be higher
and this fact can be experimentally checked by the measurements of E
min
in the case of a number of different distances d between two slits.
Another test of this new theory for radial expansion of the particle, during the
3-D symmetry breaking caused by the (very) large massive barrier, can be also
provided theoretically by the numerical computations of the radial expansion
r
0
(t;0), based on the differential equations (33) and (35).
For example, for a given distance d between two slits, we can measure the
minimal value of the kinetic energy E
min
for which the extended disk of the
electron does not reach the slits and hance would not be enable to pass through
them and to achieve the inference in the back side of the barrier. Thus, we can
set E
K
= E
min
in (35) and r
0
(△t;0) =
d
2
for the solution of (33). So, we are
abletoapply, forexample, thevariationalmethodofcomputation, byassuming
that the internal pressure P(△t;0;r
0
(△t;0)) is equal to that of the hydrostatic
equilibrium for the radius r
0
(△t;0), and then to use the variational numerical
methods for (33).
Conclusion and future work:
In1915,Einsteinpublishedfourgroundbreakingpapersthatintroducedhisthe-
oryofgeneralrelativity. Butatthetime,theGerman-borntheoreticalphysicist

was hardly known to the public, and members of the science community were
 ghting his new theory head-on, according to reports in the New York Times.
Around this time, Sir Isaac Newton's model of classical mechanics (formulated
inhis1687book"PhilosophiNaturalisPrincipiaMathematica")ruled,andEin-
stein's work was met with utmost skepticism. Based on calculations Einstein
made, about his new theory of general relativity, light from another star should
be bent by the Sun's gravity. In 1919, that prediction was con rmed by Sir
Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. Those observations
were published in the international media, making Einstein world famous.
Unfortunately for me, I have no a cathedra in physics and hence no access
to the quantum laboratory equipped for the double-slit experiments with elec-
trons. Moreover, I have only the laptops as working instruments without the
necessary numerical tools for the approximative solutions of the two differential
equations above.
So, I hope that the more experienced and well equipped quantum physicists
can consider seriously these tests and provide the de nite answers
Such a research work would be well suited for some PhD student thesis as well
and I will be glad, if invited, to offer some of my advise for it. So, if there is
some candidate PhD student or research group, please be free to contact me
for such a possibility at my e-mail address.
