Group analysis of differential equations
DISCRETE-GROUP ANALYSIS
AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF EXACT MODELS
V.F.ZAITSEV
St.Petersburg State University, Russia
Abstract.
At the end of XIX Century S.Lie offered group approach of integration
of ordinary differential equations (ODE) which forced out algorithms of ﬁrst
generation (more exactly, set of the empirical methods which based known
E.Kamke’s reference-book) at the middle of XX Century. Now, set of algo-
rithms of second generation were formed fully and it is able to ﬁnd symmetries
of ODE (Lie groups, discrete groups and ﬁrst integrals) and to integrate of
equation in analytic form in event that quantity of symmetries is suﬃciently.
Nevertheless, a number of the equations describing real processes and phe-
nomena don’t enjoy ”rich” of symmetries because experimental results are ab-
solutly exact never. These results are modeled as series, moreover, transition
to more exact approximation ”kills” even ”poor” symmetries which simpliﬁed
model had.
Offering algorithms of third generation permit to show necessary (some-
times suﬃcient too) criterious of existence of the model with a priori symmetryDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N2, 1998
(algorithms prognostic) or to discribe all models of the given form with re-
quired symmetry (algorithms of inverse problem). As problem of modelling
is many-valied the above set of equation is more effective for description of
real processes and phenomena then looking over all variants and making more
precise of concrete models by algorithms of second generation.
The generalized problem of two motionless centres is a good example of
algorithm of third generation for modelling of orbit of artiﬁcial Earth satellite.
It’s well known that differential equations theory takes a central place
among possible instruments for the modelling of different processes and phe-
nomena. All the existing methods of exact solution of ordinary differential
equations (ODE) can be conditionally divided in two groups:
A)asearchfortransformationoftheoriginalODEDtosomeotherODED
1
which belongs to one of the ”standard” classes of ODE having known solutions;
B) a search for transformation leaving original ODE D invariant, i.e. trans-
formation into ”itself”, that gives independent information about solution.
Practically all of the classic methods of exact solution of ODE use the
approach A based on a rather restricted number of ”standard” soluble ODE,
therefore transformations often are ”artiﬁcial”. Thus the known soluble equa-
tions generate a set without visible logic, its classiﬁcation is diﬃcult, and their
search was essentially a matter of art until the nearest past, the fact that can
be perfectly illustrated with the help of [1]. To develop the approach A one
can apply different transformations to ”standard” soluble equations inﬁnitely
extending the set of such equations. However the probability that the ODE
chosen for the investigation belongs to the extended set is very small.
The approach B suggested by S.Lie in the end of the last century is based
on a search of continuous transformation groups leaving the tested equation
invariant. Speciﬁcally, for example, a knowledge of a two-parmetric group ad-
mitted by a second order ODE gives a general solution of this equation (if there
is a possibility to ﬁnd universal invariants of the group). However, as S.Lie has
shown the search for a group admitted by a ﬁrst order ODE is as diﬃcult as
the search for its general solution; the Lie method for higher order ODE gives
rather non-numerous partial cases of solubility which simply had slipped from
the attention of the researchers who were using the approach A. Nevertheless,
the approach B allows to classify the cases of order reduction of the ODE; this
approach has been very effective for partial differential equations (see, for ex.,
[2]).

A wish to unite the advantages and to possibly free oneself from the ﬂaws
of the approaches A and B in the case of ODE has led to the creating of a
discrete-group analysis. It may seem paradoxical, but the decreed goal can be
attainedbygivinguptwobasicprinciples–continuityandintegrability. Giving
up continuity involves non-applicability of the inﬁnitesimal approach and as a
consequence nonlinearity of the deﬁning system. Giving up integrability one
would think that we deprive ourselves of the property which is the basic goal of
our research. Yet practical applications show that on the contrary a realization
of the idea pointed out above turns out to be very fruitful and allows one to
describediscretesymmetriesoftheclassesofequationswhichhavenointegrable
cases at all as well as to discover some new solvable cases on the basis of
the known ones, which couldn’t be usually found by another regular methods
(classical and group-theoretical ones).
The discrete-group analysis (DGA) does not operate with a single equation
as in applications of Lie method, but operates with a class of equations D ,
dependingonavector~ aofparameters,containingtheinvestigatedequation;but
contrary to the approach A one consider the transformations of the given class
P , which are closed in itself on a chosen class of ODE, i.e. the transformations,
which bring an element of the class D D(~ a) ∈ D
1
⊂ D again to an element
of the class D : D(~ a) → D(
~
b) (elements ~ a and
~
b may either coincide, or not
coincide).
A set G of transformations, which possess the pointed out property, is
named a discrete transformation group (DTG), admissible by a class D . The
invariance of a class of ODE with respect to DTG does not directly imply the
integrability (as in the case of approach B) due to giving up the continuity
condition (an admissible DTG is as a rule essentially larger than a continuous
equivalence group [2] and it can’t be found by Lie method). Nevertheless a
knowledge of a DTG allows one to get a wide-range information about the
properties of a class of ODE:
1. One determines a discrete symmetry of a class D with a use of classiﬁ-
cation parameter – vector~ a (a group classiﬁcation of a class D ).
2. A class D splits into non-intersecting equivalence subclasses - orbits,
which can not be connected by DTGG transformations of elements of D .
3. Invariants of DTG are determined – these are equations and subclasses
of equations from D , which are invariant with respect to either all or some
transformations from G (such discrete invariants, as a rule, can’t be found by
Lie method).

4. In some cases one can ﬁnd classes of particular solutions of ODE for a
class D or some subclass D
1
⊂ D .
Itiswellknown[2],thattheknowledgeofaone-parametricLiegroupadmis-
sible by ordinary differential equation gives us a ﬁrst integral of this equation,
i.e. conservation law. In this connection one has a right to ask oneself what is
the physical meaning of a discrete transformation group. Firstly it is obvious
that any orbit of the group can be represented by some polyhedron in the space
of parameters and any generator of the group speciﬁes a discrete symmetry of
this polyhedron similar to a crystallographic group. Secondly a discrete trans-
formation group can be treated either as a similarity law for the models or,
taking into account a discreteness of symmetry (i.e. an absence of a connectiv-
ityoftheorbit), asa resonance ora commensurability of the models . Finally,
in some cases (for instance, for many linear equations) a discrete group admits
a unique interpretation as selection rules , moreover that group elements often
act as transformations of translation of the spectruma : λ
k
→ λ
k+1
.
The discrete-group method of integration is based on the next two princi-
ples.
1. Any orbit of DTG G , which contains a solvable element, is solvable as
a whole.
2. A substitution of a concomitant [2] of a DTG G to the invariant of a
DTGG brings it to the integrable or canonical form.
Therefore a set of integrable cases of a class D – ”a mesh” – has a structure

is a set of solvable invariants
of a class D . Let us note that the extension of a ”classical” set D

by means
of DGA will be the more essential the more elements ofG will belong to those
classes of transformations the search of which is diﬃcult by classical methods
(we mean the point transformations for ODE of the 1−st order, the Backlund
transformations for ODE of the 2−nd order and nonlocal transformations for
ODE of the 3−rd and of the higher orger).

admits the basic (i.e. valid for arbitrary n , m , l) group D

of the order 6 [3]
but only the subgroup of the 2−nd order consists of point transformations.
Therefore the application of only the basic group allows us to increase the

number of integrable cases of the equation (1) in three times as compared with
the ”classical” set. A great advantage of DGA before the approach A is the
algorithmicity of its principal methods which are basically analogous to Lie
method (the approach B). The most general (direct) method consists in the
following procedure. An arbitrary equation of a class D
y
(n)
= F(x,y,y

,~ a)
is transformed by a substitution of a general form, which belongs to a chosen
class of transformations, for example, to the class of Backlund transformations
of the order k
y = f(t,u, ˙ u,...,u

),
x = g(t,u, ˙ u,...,u

) (2)
with the following condition of closure – the exclusion of the highest derivative

then we’ll get the mappingH : D−→ D

instead of DTG, admissible by a class
D .
In any case the obtained differential expression splits with respect to dif-
ferent degrees of independent variables u
(s)
, where k < s < n , which gives
an overdetermined set of partial differential equations where the unknowns are
the functions f and g from the transformation (2). In the general case the
determining system is nonlinear as contrary to analogous linear system of Lie
algorithm. Asuccessivespecifyingofatransformationclassleadssuccessivelyto

All the following operations with the determined DTG may be fulﬁlled not

tions – the vectors~ a and

A great advantage of the discrete-group analysis is also a possibility of a prog-
nosis of the solution structure, i.e. of its representation by speciﬁc classes of
functions: either elementary, or special functions. For the purpose of illustra-
tion of this statement we shall use the differential algebra technique.

ators will named the rank of the ring C

˜
C

is also a differential ring of
the rank p . The following statement takes place.
THEOREM. The subring
˜
C
p
is invariant with respect to any DTG G ,
which is generated by the Backlund transformations (2) if the functions f and
g are rational.
CONSEQUENCE. Let a class of ODE D admits the DTGG , which meets
the conditions of the theorem and the element D(~ a) has a general solution,
given in a parametric form (x(τ),y(τ))∈
˜
C
p
. Then a general solution of any
element of the orbitGD(~ a) belongs to
˜
C
p
.
A REMARK. The limitation, that the class of Backlund transformations
(2) must be the class of rational differential substitutions, can be omitted for
the appropriate extension of the original differential ring C
p
.
EXAMPLE. The orbit of the element (0,−1/2,0) of the pseudogroup, ad-
missible by the class (1) has an order 16. The transformationsr,g,s are speci-
ﬁed by the rational expressoins of new variables:
r : (n,m,l)−→ (m,n,3−l), x = u,y = t;
g : (n,m,l)−→ (1/(1−l),−n/(n+1),(2m+1)/m), x = u

s : (n,m,0)−→ (−n−m−3,m,0), x = t

Taking into account that the solution of the original equation (0,−1/2,0) can
be expressed through the polynomial functions of τ : x(τ) = C
