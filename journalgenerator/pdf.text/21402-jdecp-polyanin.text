Abstract. Solutions of singularly perturbed boundary-value problems with a
small parameter are characterized by large gradients in very narrow regions
(boundary layers). This circumstance sharply limits the use of standard  nite-
difference methods with a  xed stepsize in such problems due to signi cant
calculation errors or possible loss of stability. This paper presents an effective
method for numerical integration of singularly perturbed boundary-value prob-
lems based on replacing the spatial variable with a new independent variable of
the Sundman-type, which depends on the derivatives of the unknown function.
The use of such non-local transformations, which satisfy a simple asymptoticDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2021
condition, makes it possible to automatically stretch the boundary-layer re-
gion. The resulting problem turns out to be much simpler than the original one
in the sense that standard (classical) numerical methods with a  xed stepsize
can already be applied to solve it. Several new multiparameter nonlinear and
linear singularly perturbed boundary-value problems for second-order reaction-
diffusion type ODEs having monotonic and non-monotonic exact or asymp-
totic solutions, expressed in terms of elementary functions, are constructed. A
comparison of numerical solutions with exact and asymptotic solutions is pre-
sented. The numerical results show that the method based on Sundman-type
transformations for solving boundary-layer problems gives high accuracy. As
a result of an extensive analysis of the obtained results, recommendations are
given for the choice of regularizing functions that determine the most effective
Sundman-type transformations. The difference between regularizing functions
in boundary-layer problems and blow-up problems is discussed. The test prob-
lems formulated in this paper can be used to estimate the accuracy of any other
numerical methods for solving two-point singularly perturbed boundary-value
problems with a small parameter.

1. Introduction
Singularly perturbed linear and nonlinear boundary-value problems with its
highest order derivative multiplied by a small parameter are often used for
mathematical modeling of various phenomena and processes in natural science
and engineering (such problems are often encountered, for example, in hydro-
and aerodynamics [1, 2, 3] and in the theory of convective heat and mass transfer
[3, 4, 5]). An important qualitative feature of such problems is that for the
zero value of a small parameter the order of the differential equation under
consideration decreases and some boundary conditions cannot be satis ed.
Singularly perturbed boundary-value problems have large gradients of solu-
tions in narrow regions (boundary layers), which leads to a loss of convergence

of standard  nite-difference methods and makes them of little use for solving
problems of this type (in [6], examples of exotic incorrect numerical solutions
of singularly perturbed problems obtained by ordinary non-specialized meth-
ods are given). One of the  rst works, where in full measure it was said on
the inadmissibility of classical  nite-difference schemes and the need to develop
special schemes, possessing the property of convergence regardless of the value
of the small parameter, there were publications [7, 8], in which the foundations
of two different approaches to the solution of boundary-value problems with a
boundary layer were laid. In [7], the classical central-difference scheme was pro-
posed with a grid, thickening near boundary layers and having a uniform error
in the approximation of nodes (such a grid has uniformly second-order accuracy
with respect to a small parameter). In [8], an exponential  tting scheme was
developed, the coe cients of which were chosen in such a way that the scheme
is asymptotically exact in the boundary-layer region (this approach allows us
to construct uniformly convergent  nite-difference schemes on a uniform grid).
Various methods of the numerical integration for linear and nonlinear
singularly perturbed boundary-value problems are considered, for example,
in [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 34, 16, 17, 18, 20, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,
28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. For numerical solution of such problems various authors
apply methods with a piecewise-uniform grid (two-grid methods) characteriz-
ing by a small stepsize in the boundary layer and a large stepsize outside the
boundary layer (for example, see [11, 13, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29]). It is important to
note that in the methods based on the use of a piecewise-uniform grid (as well
as the methods developed in [7, 8]), a priori information on the structure and
the rate of damping of asymptotic solutions in the boundary layer is taken into
account (explicitly or implicitly).
In [35] (see also [36]), for numerical integration of singularly perturbed
boundary-value problems with a single boundary layer, it was proposed to
apply non-local transformations at the initial stage, which allows further in-
tegration of the reduced problem by standard numerical methods applying a
uniform grid for the computational domain. This paper is a further deepening
and development of the approach [35], which is based on the application of
non-local transformations (generalized Sundman transformations) for the nu-
merical integration of singularly perturbed boundary-value problems. Extensive
testing of this method has been carried out on new transformations and new,
more complex nonlinear multiparameter test problems, the solutions of which
are expressed in elementary functions. Comparison of numerical, exact, and

asymptotic solutions showed the high e ciency of the Sundman transforma-
tions method for solving singularly perturbed problems with a boundary layer
(even for problems with degeneracy, when the highest derivative vanishes at the
boundary).
Remark 1. Generalized Sundman transformations (non-local transfor-
mations) were used in [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42] for numerical integration of Cauchy
problems with monotonic and non-monotonic blow-up solutions that have very
large gradients in a neighborhood of a priori unknown point. Comparison of
exact and numerical solutions of several test problems for ODEs of the  rst,
second, third and fourth orders, as well as systems of nonlinear coupled ODEs,
showed high e ciency of this method for numerical integration of blow-up prob-
lems. In [42], non-local transformations were used for numerical integration of
blow-up problems for nonlinear PDEs.
Remark 2. In [44, 45, 46, 47, 48], generalized Sundman transformations
of special type were applied to obtain exact solutions,  rst integrals, and also
to linearize some second-order ODEs.
Remark 3. In [1, 49, 50, 51, 52, 34, 53, 54, 55], asymptotic methods
are described that make it possible to  nd approximate analytical solutions to
boundary-layer problems.
Note that hypersingular nonlinear boundary-value problems are not con-
sidered in this paper (in hypersingular boundary-value problems with a small
parameter", super-thin boundary layers arise, and the derivative at the bound-
ary layer can have very large values of the order ofe
1="
and more [43] (in ordinary
problems with boundary layers, the derivative at the boundary usually has the
order of "
 1
or "
 1=2
)).
2. Qualitative features of singularly perturbed boundary-
layer problems with a small parameter
2.1. Illustrating a three-parameter linear problem. Exact and asymp-
totic solutions. Boundary-layer region
Let us analyze qualitative features of singularly perturbed boundary-value prob-
lems with a small parameter at the highest derivative, that have solutions of
the boundary-layer type, on an example of a speci c problem.
Test problem 1. We consider the following three-parameter boundary-value

problem for the second-order linear equation with constant coe cients [35]:

+y = 0 (0<x< 1); y(0) =a; y(1) =b; (1)
where a, b, and " are free parameters. A boundary layer for this problem
develops near the point x = 0 as "! 0 ("> 0).
Depending on the values of the determining parameters, problem (1) can
have both monotonic and non-monotonic solutions. The exact solution of the
problem is determined by the formulas
y =
a exp( 
2

exp(

(a eb). From the above relation for the  rst derivative, it follows
that when using direct numerical methods to solve such singularly perturbed
boundary-value problems with a small parameter, the shooting numerical pro-
cedure should begin with large values of the derivative (of order "
 1
), which is
a complicating factor for numerical methods.
Let us assume a  0 and b  0. If a > eb, then solution (2) decreases
monotonically and if a < eb, then solution (2) increases monotonically, and
very quickly, in a narrow region 0 x<x
 
, where
x

'eb (for case a = 0): (3)
In the remaining region x
 
 x  1, the solution is a monotonically decreasing
function that changes slowly enough.
The exact solutions (2) of problem (1) are shown in Fig. 1 by the solid
lines for two sets of numerical values of the determining parameters: a) a = 1,
b = 0, " = 0:005 and b) a = 0, b = 1, " = 0:005. One can see that for
the second set of values the solution in the region 0  x  x
 
  0:026709653
increases rapidly (the maximum value y
 
  2:646247631), and in the region
x
 
  x  1 it decreases slowly. For comparison in Fig. 1, we also present the
curves obtained by using the exact solution (2) for " = 0:05 and " = 0:5 (the
dashed and dash-dotted lines, respectively). It is seen that as the parameter "
decreases near the point x = 0, the curved lines become steeper and steeper,
approaching the vertical line.

determining parameters: a)a = 1,b = 0," = 0:005 and b)a = 0,b = 1," = 0:005 (the dashed
and dash-dotted lines are obtained by using formula (2) for" = 0:05 and" = 0:5, respectively).
When applying direct numerical methods in such problems, to take into
account the singularities of the solution in the boundary-layer region, it is nec-
essary to take su ciently many points in a small neighborhood of the left bound-
ary. Therefore, the use of uniform grids throughout the domain of variation of
the independent variable x is connected with the necessity of partitioning the
region 0 x  1 into a large number of intervals of integration.
2.2. Order relation between the  rst and second derivatives
Let us assume thatja ebj =O(1). Then, taking into account the estimates of
the  rst and second derivatives given after solution (2), we obtain the following
order relation between the derivatives on the left boundary:

: (4)
Following [35], we will now show that under certain assumptions about the
local behavior of the solutions, the order relation between derivatives (4) is
su ciently general and is valid if, inside the boundary layer region, the leading
term of the asymptotic expansion of the solution as "! 0 has the form y =
'(x= ), where ' = '(z) is a smooth function, the  rst and second derivatives
of which are bounded and non-vanishing in some neighborhood of the point
z = 0, and   =  (") is a function with the property  ! 0 as "! 0. Indeed,
differentiating twice the function y = '(x= ) with respect to x, we  nd the

formulas, we obtain the order relation (4), which we will need later.
3. Numerical integration of boundary-value
problems based on Sundman transformations
3.1. Description of the solution method
Let us consider two-point problems for second-order nonlinear ODEs with
boundary conditions of the  rst kind (Dirichlet boundary conditions):
y
00
xx
=f(x;y;y
0
x
) (0<x< 1); (5)
y(0) =a; y(1) =b; (6)
where the function f can also depend on the small parameter " > 0. For
singularly perturbed boundary-value problems we have f = "
 1
F (x;y;y
0
x
;"),
where F (x;y;z; 0) is a smooth function of three arguments.
We introduce a new non-local (Sundman-type) independent variable   by
means of the  rst-order differential equation and the initial condition [35] (see,
also [37, 38, 39]):
 
0
x
=g(x;y;y
0
x
);  (0) = 0; (7)
where g = g(x;y;y
0
x
) is a regularizing function that must satisfy some simple
conditions described below.
We introduce the notation z = y
0
x
. It is not di cult to show that the
original boundary-value problem (5){(6) after passing to the Sandman-type
variable (7) is transformed to the following problem for the system of three
 rst-order coupled ODEs [35]:
x
0
 
=
1
g(x;y;z)
; y
0
 
=
z
g(x;y;z)
; z
0
 
=
f(x;y;z)
g(x;y;z)
(0<  < 
1
);
x(0) = 0; y(0) =a; y( 
1
) =b;
(8)
where the value  
1
is determined during the solution process when the  nal
condition x( 
1
) = 1 is reached.
Let us consider the simplest regularizing function: g  1. In this case, the
 rst ODE of system (8), taking into account the initial condition x(0) = 0,
gives  =x and numerical integration of the remaining two ODEs is equivalent
to the integration of the original problem (5){(6).
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 22Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2021
For the general case, the regularizing functiong =g(x;y;z), successfully se-
lected, itself will determine the position and the density of points of integration
with respect to the original variablesx andy and allow more accurately to solve
problem (8) using the shooting method or other standard  xed-step numerical
methods with respect to the new non-local variable   [56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61].
3.2. Regularizing functions. The asymptotic condition.
Examples
For numerical solution of singularly perturbe boundary-value problems, as well
as for solving blow-up Cauchy problems, it is reasonable to use regularizing
functions of the form [37, 38, 39]:
g =G(jzj;jfj) G(jy
0
x
j;jy
00
xx
j); (9)
where f = f(x;y;z) is the right-hand side of equation (5) and z = y
0
x
. We
impose the following conditions on the function G =G(u;v):
G> 0; G
u
  0; G
v
  0; G!1 as u +v!1; G(0; 0) = 1 (10)
with u  0 and v  0.
When using regularizing functions of the form (9) for at and rectilinear
segments of the curve y = y(x), on which y
0
x
= const, a  xed stepsize in  
gives a  xed stepsize in x. Note that if equation (5) is autonomous (that is,
the equation does not depend explicitly on x) and the regularizing function is
chosen in the form (9), then the second and the third equations of system (8)
form an independent subsystem that is integrated independently of the  rst
equation.
If the right-hand side of the singularly perturbed ODE (5) has the form
f(x;y;y
0
x
) ="
 1
F (x;y;y
0
x
);
when choosing regularizing functions, besides the simple conditions (9){(10),
additional considerations should be taken into account.
If the Sundman transformations are not applied, i.e. g = 1, and"! 0, the
right-hand sides of the last two ODEs in (8) will tend to in nity (sincejzj!1
andjfj!1) in the boundary layer. In this region, we also havejfj =O(z
2
),
which follows from the order relation (4). The speci ed qualitative features of
such problems signi cantly complicate the use of standard numerical methods
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 23Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2021
for their integration and lead to the necessity of proportional re nement of the
stepsize as " decreases.
To avoid re ning the grid as"! 0 and to use a  xed stepsize with respect to
the Sundman-type variable , one should choose suitable regularizing functions
satisfying the following asymptotic condition [35]:
jzj=g =O(1) as "! 0: (11)
Then in the boundary layer the right-hand side of the second ODE in (8) will not
have singularities as "! 0, and the third ODE in (8) will have a substantially
smaller singularity than for g = 1. It follows from (10) that it is possible to
choose regularizing functions which have asymptotics
g!m
1
jzj as jzj!1 or g!m
2
jfj
1=2
as jfj!1; (12)
wherem
1
andm
2
are positive constants of the order of unity. Such asymptotic
conditions (as well as the normalization condition in (10)) can be satis ed, for
example, if we take simple regularizing functions of the form
g = 1 +jzj or g = (1 +jfj)
1=2
: (13)
Let us consider in more detail the  rst regularizing function (13). In this
case, the inequalityjzj=g < 1 holds. From the second equation of system (8)
we getjy
0
 
j  1. In the boundary-layer region, where the derivative z is large
as"! 0, we havejy
0
 
j  1, which leads to a linear dependencey    + const.
The right-hand side of the third equation of system (8), taking into account
relation (4) (that isjfj  z
2
), becomes linear with respect to z in this region.
Outside the boundary layer, system (8) does not have qualitative features. The
second regularizing function (13) has similar qualitative features.
Thus, the use of regularizing functions (13) allows us to completely suppress
the unbounded growth of the right-hand side of the second equation of system
(8) in the boundary-layer region as "! 0 and to reduce (in comparison with
g = 1) the right-hand side of the third equation. Further, by using concrete
examples, it will be shown that regularizing functions of the form (13) have a
limited scope.
It is also advisable to use more complicated regularizing functions of the
mixed form
g = (1 +k

1=2
; (14)
g = 1 +k

g = 1 +k max(jzj;jfj

); (16)

which satisfy the asymptotic condition (11) as well as the normalization con-
dition in (10). Formulas (14){(16) include the parameters k
1
  0, k
2
  0, and
k > 0 which can vary (with k
1
+k
2
= O(1) and k = O(1)). Note that the
regularizing function (14) was proposed in [35]. It will be further shown that
regularizing functions (15){(16) are more universal than functions (13) and (14)
and lead to much more accurate numerical solutions.
3.3. Additional explanations and comments

. From equation (7) and formula (9), for small increments of the argument
 x, neglecting terms of the order of o( x), we obtain
   =G(jzj;jfj) x;
where z =y
0
x
and f =y

.
It follows that the choice of a  xed stepsize for a new variable    = h
is equivalent to using a variable stepsize for the original independent variable
 x =h=G. Suppose that G =G(u)> 0, G(0) = 1, G
0
u
> 0, and u =jzj. Then
an increase in the derivativez with respect tox leads to a decrease in the stepsize
 x. Therefore, the application of the generalized Sundman transformations
corresponds to the automatic choice of the stepsize with respect to x. When
using formulas (13) and (14) the stepsize  x is small in the boundary-layer
region.
2
 
. It is useful to additionally transform problem (8), which was obtained
after the transition to a new (Sundman-type) independent variable, by intro-
ducing a normalized derivative by the formula   z = "z. In this case, for the
regularizing functions (13) and (14), the right-hand sides of the second and
third equations obtained from (8) (and written in the form resolved with re-
spect to derivatives) will be bounded in the boundary-layer region.
3
 
. Methods, based on the use of a piecewise-uniform grid (see, for example,
[22, 23]) are particular degenerate cases of the method based on generalized
Sundman transformations with a piecewise-smooth regularizing function of the
form g =

. For moderately small values of " ("

that do not satisfy the asymptotic condition (11) can be used. However, such

. In this paper, we apply a combination of the classical explicit Runge{
Kutta method of the fourth-order of approximation with a  xed stepsize and
a speci c shooting procedure with Maple implementation [60]. For this pur-
pose, an auxiliary Cauchy problem described by the transformed equations (8)
with the  rst two conditions at the left extreme point and an additional initial
condition z(0) = s is numerically integrated. The value of the parameter s
is determined by satisfying the boundary condition at the right extreme point
x = 1 (see the last boundary condition in (8)). Similarly, after applying a
generalized Sundman transformation to the original problem in the  rst stage,
any effective numerical methods with a  xed stepsize (for example, explicit
and implicit Runge{Kutta methods, explicit Adams{Bashforth and implicit
Adams{Moulton methods [62, 63, 64]) can be used in the  nal stage.
The general ow chart showing the main steps needed to implement the
proposed method is displayed in Fig. 2.
4. Singularly perturbed linear boundary-value problems.
Numerical and analytical solutions
4.1. Linear simple test problem. Numerical solutions
obtained by using various regularizing functions
First, we illustrate the characteristic features of the proposed method on simple
linear problems.
The results of numerical integration of the transformed problem (8), used
for solving the original problem (1), for f = "
 1
(z +y) with the regularizing
functiong = 1 +jzj +jfj
1=2
, which are obtained by the shooting method (from
the point x = 0) with the  xed stepsize h = 0:01 by using Maple [60], are
shown in Fig. 1 by points for two sets of numerical values of the determining
parameters. The  rst set is a = 1, b = 0, " = 0:005 (monotonic solution) and

It can be seen that the seven regularizing functions (Nos. 2{8) make it
possible to obtain numerical solutions in the entire region with high accuracy
even with a su ciently large stepsize (with respect to  ) equal to h = 0:1.
It is important to note that the  rst  ve regularizing functions (Nos. 1{5)
were used in [35], and the three functions (Nos. 6{8) are new. It can be seen that
the best results are obtained by using the new regularizing function No. 6: for a

nonmonotonic solution and the stepsize 0:01, it provides an order of magnitude
of the numerical solution more accurate than the other regularizing functions.
Function No. 8 also provides high accuracy of calculations. Further comparison
of numerical and exact solutions in more complex nonlinear test boundary layer
problems will lead to the same conclusions: these two regularizing functions
lead to very good results in the vast majority of cases. Here and further on, for
greater clarity, the two best results in each column of all tables are highlighted

Let us compare, for example, the maximum absolute errors of the numer-
ical solutions obtained for a given " with the regularizing function No. 8 and
function No. 9 (the latter solution is obtained without using transformations)
with the same number of grid points. In this case, for N = 100, the use of
generalized Sundman transformations makes it possible to increase the accu-
racy of the numerical solution by more than 1200{3000 times, and forN = 500,
approximately 850 times (as the number of grid points increases, the error of
the numerical solution, obtained without using transformations, gradually de-
creases).
It can be seen that for all regularizing functions considered in Table 2, the
accuracy of the numerical integration of problem (1) with a monotone solution
for a = 1, b = 0 is signi cantly higher than the accuracy of the numerical
integration of problem (1) with a non-monotonic solution for a = 0, b = 1.
It can also be seen that function No. 1 is low effective for the non-monotonic
solution. This is due to the fact that near the boundary layer there is a sharp
extremum at the point x = x
 
(see Fig. 1b) where the derivative vanishes,
y
0
x
j
x=x
 
= zj
x=x
 
= 0. Using formula (2) with a = 0 and b = 1, we  nd the
curvature at the extremum point

: (17)
Thus, the curvature of k
 
tends to in nity as "! 0. Therefore, in the vicinity
of the point x
 
, where the most dramatic qualitative changes of the solution
take place, it is necessary to make a small stepsize to obtain high accuracy
of numerical calculations. When choosing the regularizing function No. 1 in
Table 2, we have g = 1 +jzj   1 in the vicinity of the extremum, so the
stepsize in x (for a  xed N) here will be maximal (whereas a small stepsize is
required for this region with a large curvature). This circumstance leads to a
large calculation error in the extremum region for the function g = 1 +jzj.
To explain the above more clearly, let us make a linear-fractional transfor-
mation of the independent variable
X =
(  + 1)x
x + 
;   =
x
 
1  2x

which stretches the boundary layer area and translates the point x
 
in thex,y
plane to the pointX
 
= 1=2 in theX,y plane (and leaves the endpoints of the
considered interval motionless).

In Fig. 3a), the exact solution (2) of problem (1) is shown by the thick
solid line for a = 0, b = 1, " = 0:005 in the X, y plane. Also in Fig. 3b),
we present the behavior of the absolute error E of the numerical solution of
the transformed problem (8) for the regularizing function g = 1 +jzj with the
stepsize 0.01 and the same values of the parameters. It can be seen that the
maximum absolute error in this case is located in the transition area between
the boundary layer and the outer region (near the extremum of the functiony).
Figure 3: a) Exact solution (2) of problem (1) with a = 0, b = 1, and " = 0:005 in the x,
y plane (thin solid line) and in the X, y plane (thick solid line); b) absolute error E of the

The regularizing functions of mixed type Nos. 3{5 in Tables 1 and 2, in
addition toz =y

, satisfy the asymptotic condition (11)
in the boundary-layer region.
The inclusion of the second derivative in these formulas allows us to take
into account the large curvature in the vicinity of the extremum point (see (17)),
and accordingly, reduces the stepsize (with respect tox) in this area. Therefore,
the accuracy of numerical solutions obtained by using the regularizing functions
Nos. 3{5 is much higher than by using function No. 1.
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 31Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2021
For the non-monotonic solution (with a = 0, b = 1) the best results are
given by the regularizing function No. 4.
In Fig. 4, the numerical integration results of the transformed problem (8),
used for solving the original problem (1), are shown fora = 0,b = 1," = 0:005,

the original independent variablex and normalized Sundman-type variable

, which stretches the boundary-layer region.
Precisely such a stretching of the region with large gradients, which oc-
curs automatically after choosing a suitable regularizing function, reduces the
stepsize inx and ensures high accuracy of numerical solutions in the boundary
layer.
Further, we will consider only boundary-layer type problems that have non-
monotonic solutions (since such problems present the greatest di culties for
numerical integration).

The special caseg = 1 corresponds to the direct numerical solution (without
using transformations) with the same stepsize with respect tox. It can be seen
that functions Nos. 4{8 allow one to obtain numerical solutions in the entire
region with high accuracy even with a su ciently large stepsize (with respect
to  ) equal to h = 0:1. For stepsize h = 0:05 and h = 0:01, the best results are
provided by functions No. 6 and No. 8.
Unsatisfactory results for function No. 2 can be explained by the fact that
in this case a degeneracy occurs at the initial point, where the second derivative
vanishes, y

Indeed, when choosing the regularizing function No. 2, in the vicinity of the
point x = 0 we have g = (1 +jfj)

not satis ed.
Therefore, the function g = (1 +jfj)

cannot suppress here the growth of
the right-hand side of the second equation of the transformed problem (8).
As a result, the stepsize inx (for a  xedN) will be maximum here (whereas
for this region with a large  rst derivative, y

The solution of problem (33){(34) cannot be represented in a closed ana-
lytical form. Therefore, in order to obtain an approximate solution as "! 0,
we use the method of matched asymptotic expansions [52, 53, 53].
As "! 0, near the left boundary x = 0, a boundary layer, called the inner
region, is formed. In this region, the last term of equation (33) can be neglected.

recommended in [35].
Recall that earlier, in Sections 4.1 and 5.1, by analyzing the solutions of
test problems (1) and (23){(24) (for some parameter values), it was shown that
the regularizing functions (13) (functions Nos. 1 and 2 in the tables) are of
limited applicability and do not work well for non-monotonic solutions or if the
original equation degenerates at the border of the boundary layer.
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 42Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2021
6.2. Difference between the choice of regularizing functions in
boundary-layer problems and blow-up problems
In Cauchy problems for nonlinear ODEs, the blow-up solutions can be repre-
sented in a vicinity of the power-law singular point x
 
as
y'A(x x
 
)
  
;   > 0; (40)
where 0  x < x
 
. Since the position of the singular point x
 
is unknown in
advance, it is di cult to solve such problems by standard numerical methods
with a  xed stepsize.
In [39, 40, 41], to solve blow-up problems, it was proposed to use Sandman-
type transformations of the form (7), which replaced the unknown interval of
variation of the independent variable of the original problem 0  x < x
 
by a
given semi-in nite interval 0   <1 of the resulting problem. By integrating
Eq. (7), we have
  =
Z
x
0
g(x;y;y
0
x
)dx; y =y(x): (41)
Since the singular point x
 
after transformation must go to the in nite point
  =1, the condition
lim
x!x
 
I =1; I =
Z
x
0
g(x;y;y
0
x
)dx (42)
must be satis ed.
For second-order nonlinear ODEs, taking into account the relations (40)
and (42), it can be shown that for the simplest regularizing functions of the
form g =g(z) and g =g(f) with z =y
0
x
and f =y
00
xx
, the following power-law
asymptotic conditions should be used [40, 41]:
g(z)!m

jzj

 +1
+"
1
as jzj!1; (43)
g(f)!m
2
jfj
1
 +2

2
as jfj!1; (44)
where m
1
> 0, m
2
> 0, "
1
  0, and "
2
  0. To the conditions (43) and (44),
as in the problems with a boundary layer, one should add a condition of the
normalization type g(0) = 1. Comparative analysis of exact and numerical
solutions to blow-up problems showed that in asymptotic relations (43) and
(44) one should choose the minimum values "
1
="
2
= 0 [40, 41].
Electronic Journal. http://diffjournal.spbu.ru/ 43Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 4, 2021
It is seen that conditions (11) and (12) imposed on regularizing functions
in singularly perturbed problems with a small parameter differ signi cantly
from conditions (42){(44), which must be satis ed by regularizing functions in
blow-up problems.
For second-order nonlinear ODEs with monotone and non-monotone blow-
up solutions, that have a singularity in the form of a pole of any integer order
(  = 1; 2; ::: ), one can recommend to use the composite regularizing function
[39, 40, 41]:
g = (1 +jy
0
x
j +jy
00
xx
j)
1=3
; (45)
where the second derivative y
00
xx
can be replaced with the right-hand side of
the original equation y
00
xx
= f(x;y;y
0
x
). It can be seen that the regularizing
function (45) differs signi cantly from functions (39), which give good results
in boundary-layer problems.
Note that the composite regularizing functions (39) satisfy the condition
(42) for any blow-up solutions of the power-law form (40) with   > 0. The
analysis of the possibility of using these functions for numerical integration of
blow-up problems is far beyond the scope of this paper. The authors are going
to investigate this issue in the future.
7. Brief conclusions
Singularly perturbed boundary-value problems for second-order ODEs with a
small parameter at the highest derivative are considered. Such problems are
characterized by narrow boundary layers with large gradients, which greatly
limits the applicability of standard  xed-step numerical methods (their use can
lead to signi cant errors). We offer an effective method of numerical integration
of singularly perturbed boundary-value problems based on using Sundman-type
transformations. As a result, we obtain more convenient reduced problems
that allow one to apply standard numerical methods with a  xed stepsize with
respect to a new independent variable. An extensive testing of the method
is carried out on various multiparameter linear and nonlinear problems with
monotonic and non-monotonic solutions. Comparison of numerical, exact, and
asymptotic solutions of several singularly perturbed boundary-value problems
with a small parameter showed the high accuracy of the method based on
Sundman-type transformations.
