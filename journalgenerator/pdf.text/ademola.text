Abstract
In this paper, su cient conditions are established for uniform asymptotic stability of
the trivial solutions, uniform boundedness, uniform ultimate boundedness and asymptotic
behaviour of solutions of some third order nonlinear neutral delay differential equations.
We employ Lyapunov's direct method by constructing a complete Lyapunov functional
to obtain the results. Recent results on third order nonlinear delay differential equations
are particular cases of our results.
Keywords: Third order; Nonlinear differential equation; Uniform stability and ultimate
boundedness; Asymptotic behaviour; Complete Lyapunov functional
1 Introduction
The di culties in obtaining analytical solutions of nonlinear differential equa-
tions resulting from mathematical models prompted researchers in the determi-
nation of the qualitative behaviour of solutions. Methods, such as Lyapunov's
direct method, frequency domain approach, comparison theorems, adaptiveDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2013
methods, canonical transformation, solutions representations, the well known
Cauchy formula, to mention few have been developed to obtain information on
the qualitative behaviour of solutions of differential equations in the literature
when there is no analytical expression for solutions.
Till now with respect to our observation in the relevant literature, the most
effective method to determine qualitative behaviour of solutions of differential
equations is still the Lyapunov's direct method, see for instance: Burton et
al [12] - [15], Driver [17], Hale [21], [22], Reissig et al [28], Rouch et al [29]
and Yoshizawa [45, 46] which contain the general results on the subject matter.
Other notable authors include Ademola et al [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8], Chukwu [16],
Ezeilo [18, 19, 20], Hara [23], Ogundare [24], Omeike [25, 26], Swick [31, 32],

[36, 37, 39, 40, 42], Yao and Wang [44] and Zhu [47] on functional or delay
differential equations.
For over four decades many authors have dealt with delay differential equations
and obtained many interesting results as stated above. In 2010, in particular,
Yao and Wang [44] discussed conditions for global asymptotic stability of the
third order nonlinear delay differential equation
...
x +'( x) +g( _ x(t r(t))) +f(x(t r(t))) = 0:
Moreover, Afuwape and Omeike [10], and Omeike [27] established criteria for
stability and boundedness of solutions of the following third order delay differ-
ential equations
...
x +a(t) x +b(t) _ x +c(t)f(x(t r(t))) = 0
and
...
x +h( _ x) x +g( _ x(t r(t))) +f(x(t r(t))) =p(t;x; _ x;x(t r(t)); _ x(t r(t));  x):
Finally, Tun  c [42] studied conditions for stability and boundedness of solutions
for the non autonomous differential equation

of solutions of delay differential equations, in general, and those of third order,
in particular, is not still solved for more general nonlinearity. Using a complete
Lyapunov functional, the purpose of this paper therefore is to obtain conditions
for uniform asymptotic stability of the zero solution, uniform boundedness,
uniform ultimate boundedness and asymptotic behaviour of solutions of the
third order nonlinear non autonomous neutral delay differential equation

Proof of Theorem 3.5. Let (x

since p  0 in (1.2), Eq. (3.1a) coincides with (3.1c). Clearly, in view of (3.1c)
