Abstract.
The paper introduces a constructive method for localization of the Morse
spectrum of a dynamical system on a vector bundle. The Morse spectrum is a
limit set of Lyapunov exponents of periodic pseudo-trajectories. The proposed
method does not demand any preliminary information on a system. An in-
duced dynamical system on the projective bundle is associated with a directed
graph called Symbolic Image. The symbolic image can be considered as a ﬁnite
discrete approximation of a dynamical system. Valuable information about
the system may come from the analysis of a symbolic image. In particular,
a neighborhood of the Morse spectrum can be found. A special sequence of
symbolicimages is consideredto obtainasequenceofembeddedneighborhoods
which converges to the Morse spectrum. The main results of this article were
announced in [20].

1 Linear extension of a homeomorphism
Let f : M → M be a homeomorphism of the compact manifold M. Let
(E,M,π) be a vector bundle overM, E be a total space, andπ be a projector
from E onto the base M. Assume that for each x∈M a ﬁber E(x) =π
−1
(x)
is d-dimension linear space isomorphic to R
d
.
Deﬁnition 1 A homeomorphism F of the total space E is said to be a linear
extension of f, if F takes ﬁbers to ﬁbers: f◦π =π◦F, i.e., the diagram
E
F
−→ E
π↓ ↓π
M
f
−→ M
commutes, and the restriction F|
E(x)
:E(x)→E(f(x)) on each ﬁber E(x) is a
linear isomorphism.
The investigation of linear extensions has been motivated by the study of
the tangent mapping of a diffeomorphism on the tangent bundle of manifold
[23, 24, 7, 8, 25, 27]. As an example of a linear extension we will keep in mind a
diffeomorphismf :M →M and its differentialDf =F on the tangent bundle
TM =E. In particular, by locating of the Morse spectrum, one can construc-
tively recognize the hyperbolicity or the normal hyperbolicity of a dynamical
system. In this section we brieﬂy show that the vector bundle E is associated
with a projective bundleP and with an one-dimension bundleL overP, in this
process the linear extension F : E → E induces a mapping PF : P → P and
its linear extension LF : L → L. Recall that a projective manifold P
d−1
is
a set of one-dimensional subspaces in R
d
. For a nonzero vector v we denote
by [v] = y a point from P
d−1
corresponding to the space spanned over v. Let
(P,M,Pπ) be a bundle over M such that each ﬁber (Pπ)
−1
(x) is a projective
manifold P
d−1
(x) associated with the ﬁber E(x) of E. The bundle (P,M,Pπ)
is called the projective bundle associated with the linear bundle (E,M,π). The
linear space R
d
can be considered as a collection of one-dimensional subspaces
L = {L(y), y ∈ P
d−1
}, where L(y) is a subspace spanned over y. So L is an
one-dimensional bundle over P
d−1
. Let us ﬁx a ﬁber E(x) of E. As above,
each linear space E(x) is considered as an one-dimensional vector bundle L(x)
over P
d−1
(x) with ﬁbers L(x,y) spanned over y ∈ P
d−1
(x). Thus, the bundle
(E,M,π)isassociatedwiththeone-dimensionallinearbundle(L,P,LPπ)over
the projective spaceP, whereL ={L(x,y), x∈M, y∈P
d−1
(x)}, andLPπ is
the induced projector from L onto P. The bundles E, P and L are nontrivial,
in general. However there is a manner of trivialization of them. More precise,
Electronic Journal.  22Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 1999
each vector bundle can be included in trivial one [2]. Hence, without a loss
of generality, we can use the following coordinates: (x,v) on E, (x,y) on P,
and (x,y,l) on L, where x ∈ M, v ∈ E(x), y ∈ P
d−1
(x), l ∈ L(y). In this
coordinates, the projectors LPπ and Pπ are of the form:
LPπ(x,y,l) = (x,y), Pπ(x,y) =x.
The linear extension F :E →E of the homeomorphism f :M →M is of the
form
F(x,v) = (f(x),A(x)v).
The mapping F induces the mapping PF : P → P on the projective bundle
and its linear extension LF : L→ L on the one-dimensional linear bundle, so
the diagram

→ L

commutes. In the coordinates (x,y,l), these mappings take the forms:
PF(x,y) = (f(x),pF(x,y)), pF(x,y) = [A(x)e(y)],
LF(x,y,l) = (f(x),pF(x,y),a(x,y)l) = (PF(x,y),a(x,y)l),
where e(y) is a basis vector in the ﬁber L(y), a(x,y)l is one-dimensional linear
mapping, i.e.,a(x,y)l isamultiplicationbythefunctiona(x,y)asbasisvectors
are ﬁxed, and|a(x,y)| =|A(x)e(y)|.
2 Chain-recurrent points
Let ρ(∗,∗) be a Riemannian metric on M.
Deﬁnition 2 An inﬁnite in both directions sequence of points {x
i
} ⊂ M is
called an ε-trajectory of f if for any i the distance between the image f(x
i
) and
x
i+1
is less than ε, i.e.,
ρ(f(x
i
),x
i+1
)<ε.
If the sequence {x
i
} is periodic then it is called a periodic ε-trajectory and the
points x
i
are called ε-periodic.
Electronic Journal.  23Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 1999
In most cases, an exact trajectory of system is seldom known, and in fact
we ought to deal with anε-trajectory for a suﬃciently smallε> 0. Denote the
set of all ε-periodic points by Per(ε). The set Per(ε) is open. It is clear that
if ε
1
>ε
2
then every ε
2
-trajectory is an ε
1
-trajectory, hence
Per(ε
2
)⊂Per(ε
1
).
Thus, the sets Per(ε), ε> 0, are embedded one inside the other.
Deﬁnition 3 A point x is called chain recurrent if x is ε-periodic for every
positive ε. The set of chain recurrent points is called a chain recurrent set.
Let us denote the chain recurrent set by CR. It is well known that the
chain recurrent set is invariant, closed and contains the returning trajectories
of all types such as periodic, almost periodic, recurrent, homoclinic and others.
It should be noted that if a chain recurrent point x is not periodic then there
exists an arbitrarily small perturbation of the mapping f in C
0
-topology for
which x is periodic [22]. One may say that a chain recurrent point is either
periodic or becomes periodic under a C
0
-perturbation. From deﬁnition of the
chain recurrent set it follows that
CR = lim
ε→0
Per(ε) =
\
ε>0
Per(ε).
In other words, the sets{Per(ε), ε> 0} forms a base of neighborhoods of the
chain recurrent set CR.
For ε> 0 a ﬁnite ε-chain ξ is deﬁned as a ﬁnite sequence x
0
,...,x
m
∈M of
length m with ρ(f(x
i
),x
i+1
)<ε, i = 0,...m−1. The same way one can deﬁne
an ε-semi-trajectory.
3 Morse spectrum
Let us consider the linear extensionF :E →E and the mapping PF :P →P
on the projective bundle associated with F. Let ξ ={(x
0
,y
0
),...,(x
m
,y
m
)} be
a ﬁnite ε-chain on the projective bundle P for the mapping PF. Deﬁne the
exponential growth rate of ξ by
λ(ξ) =

i=0
ln|F(x

where|F(x,v)| =|A(x)v|, e(y

),|e(y

)| = 1.Onecansay
that |A(x)e(y)| is a change coeﬃcient of vector length. By using the induced

mapping LF :L→L the exponential growth rate of ξ can be rewritten in the
form
λ(ξ) =
1
m
m−1
X
i=0
ln|a(x

Recall that if ξ ={(x

),(x

λ(ξ) = lim
m→∞
1
m
m−1

is the characteristic or Lyapunov exponent of the ε-semi-trajectory ξ. If ξ =
{(x
0
,y
0
),...,(x
p
,y
p
) = (x
0
,y

)} is a periodicε-trajectory of a periodp, then for
the Lyapunov exponent of ξ we have
λ(ξ) = lim

The Morse spectrum of F on the chain recurrent set CR of the associated
projective mapping PF is deﬁned as
Σ(F) = {λ∈R : there are ε
k
→ 0 and finite ε
k
−chains ξ
k
of lenths m
k
in CR with m
k
→∞ and λ(ξ
k
)→λ as k→∞}.
F. Colonius and Kliemann [7] showed that the Morse spectrum coincides with
the periodic Morse spectrum which is deﬁned as
Σ
per
(F) = {λ∈R : there are ε
k
→ 0 and periodic ε
k
−trajectories ξ
k
with λ(ξ
k
)→λ as k→∞}.
Thus, to study the Morse spectrum it is suﬃcient to investigate the behavior
of Lyapunov exponents of periodic ε-trajectories on the projective bundle as
ε→ 0.
4 Symbolic Image [14]
Now we recall a construction of a symbolic image. Let f : M → M be a
homeomorphismofmanifoldM andC ={M(1),···,M(s)}beaﬁnitecovering
of M by closed sets. The sets M(i) are called cells of the covering.
Deﬁnition 4 Let G be a directed graph having s vertices where each vertex i
corresponds to the cell M(i). The vertices i and j are connected by a directed
edge i→j if and only if M(j)∩f(M(i))6=∅. The graph G is called a symbolic
image of f with respect to the covering C.

Figure 1: Construction of a Symbolic Image.
Denote by Ver the set of vertices of G. The graph G can be considered
as a multi-correspondence G : Ver → Ver between the vertices. Graph G is
uniquely determined by its s×s matrix of transitions Π = (π
ij
): π
ij
= 1 if
and only if there is the directed edge i → j, otherwise π
ij
= 0. Much of an
effective information of a dynamical system may come from the investigation
of a symbolic image. It is easily seen that the symbolic image depends on
the covering C. Vary the covering C one changes the symbolic image of the
mapping f. It is natural to consider the symbolic image as a ﬁnite discrete
approximation of the mapping f. This approximation is more precise if the
mesh of the covering is smaller. Let
diamM(i) =max(ρ(x
1
,x
2
) :x
1
,x
2
∈M(i))
be a diameter of the cell M(i). Let d be the largest diameter of the cells M(i)
of the coveringC. Denote byq the largest diameter of the imagesf(M(i)), i =
1,...,s. We deﬁne the number r as follows. If a cell M(k) does not belong to
the covering C(i) then the distance
r
ik
=ρ(f(M(i)),M(k)) =min(ρ(x,y) :x∈f(M(i)),y6∈M(k)))
between the cellM(k) and the imagef(M(i)) is positive. Letr be a minimum
of suchr
ik
. Since the number of the pairs (i,k) described above is ﬁnite thenr
is positive.
Deﬁnition 5 A sequence{z
k
} of vertices of the graphG is called an admissible
path or simply a path if for each k the graph G contains the edge z
k
→z
k+1
. If
the sequence {z
k
} is periodic, then {z
k
} is called a periodic (admissible) path.
There is a natural connection between admissible paths on the symbolic image
Gandε-trajectoriesofthehomeomorphismf. Itcanbesaidthatanadmissible

path is a trace ofε-trajectory and vice versa. However, there are some relation-
ships between the parameters d,q,r of a symbolic image and the number ε for
which the connections take place.
Proposition 1 [16]
1. If a sequence {z
k
} is a path on the symbolic image G and x
k
∈ M(z
k
)
then the sequence {x
k
} is an ε-trajectory of the homeomorphism f for
any ε > q +d. In particular, if the sequence {z
k
} is a periodic path on
the symbolic image then the sequence {x
k
} can be chosen a periodic ε-
trajectory.
2. If a sequence {x
k
} is an ε-trajectory of the homeomorphism f , ε<r and
x
k
∈ M(z
k
) then the sequence {z
k
} is an admissible path on the symbolic
image G. In particular, if the sequence {x
k
} is periodic ε-trajectory then
the sequence {z
k
} can be chosen a periodic path on the symbolic image G.
Deﬁnition 6 A vertex of the symbolic image is called recurrent if there is a
periodic path passing through it. The set of recurrent vertices is denoted byRV.
A pair of recurrent vertices i,j are called equivalent if there is a periodic path
through i and j.
The recurrent vertices {i} are uniquely deﬁned by the nonzero diagonal
elementsπ
ii
6= 0 of the powers of the transitions matrix Π
m
, m≤s, wheres is
the number of the covering cells. By Deﬁnition 6, the set of recurrent vertices
RV decomposes into several classes{H
k
} of equivalent recurrent vertices. It is
evident that each periodic path ω is in a certain class H
k
= H(ω) determined
uniquely by ω.
5 Symbolic image of the projective mapping
Now we apply the symbolic image construction to the mapping PF. Let us
consider a symbolic image G(f) of the mapping f : M → M with respect to
a covering C(M) = {m(1),···,m(q)}. To construct a symbolic image of the
induced mapping PF : P → P it is convenient to choose a covering C(P) =
{M(z)} of the projective space P agreed with the covering C(M) such that
the projection of each cell is a cell: Pπ(M(z)) = m(j). The agreed covering
generates a natural mapping h from G(PF) onto G(f) taking the vertices z
on the vertex j: h(z) =j. Since PF(M(z

6 Linear extension of symbolic image and its spectrum
Let F : E → E be a linear extension of the homeomorphism f : M → M,
PF : P → P be the associated projective mapping and LF : L → L be the
linearextensionofPF ontheone-dimensionbundle. Inthecoordinates(x,y,l)
these mappings take the forms:
LF(x,y,l) = (PF(x,y),a(x,y)l) = (f(x),pF(x,y),a(x,y)l).
At ﬁrst, we construct a linear extension of the symbolic image by ﬁxing a
linear mapping a[ji] to each edge i → j. Let G(PF) be the symbolic image
of PF. The existence of an edge i → j on G(PF) guarantees the existence
of a point (x,y) in the cell M(i) such that the image PF(x,y) is in the cell
M(j). Obviously, such point is not unique. By setting a[ji]l = a(x,y)l we ﬁx
a linear mapping to the edge i→j. The value |a[ji]| =|A(x)e(y)| is a change
coeﬃcient of a vector length. We suppose each cell of the covering C(P) small
enough to ensure the existence of a continuous basis vectors e(x,y)∈ L(x,y),
(x,y)∈M(i). Fixing this basis we can identify the one-dimension linear spaces
L(x,y) for (x,y) ∈ M(i). The obtained linear space is denoted by R
i
. Let
(x
∗
,y
∗
)∈M(i) be a point such that PF(x
∗
,y
∗
)∈M(j). We have the estimate
|a(x
∗
,y
∗
)−a(x,y)|<η(d),
whereη(d) is a modulus of continuity ofa(x,y) andd is the maximal diameter
of cellsfromthe coveringC(P). Thestructureconsisting ofthesymbolicimage
G(PF) and the linear maps{a[ji] :R

} is said to be an one-dimensional
linear extension LG of a symbolic image G(PF).

The ﬁrst aim is to discover a constructive method for a computation of
the spectrum of the linear extension LG. The second aim is to compare the
spectrum of LG and the Morse spectrum of a dynamical system.

z

as i6= j; i,j = 1,...,p. Let ω ={z

From Propositions 3 and 4 it follows
Theorem 1 The spectrum of the linear extension LG consists of the intervals
[λ
min
(H
k
),λ
max
(H
k
)], where {H
k
} is the full family of classes of equivalent re-
current vertices of the symbolic image G(PF).
One has to emphasize that the intervals [λ
min
(H
k
),λ
max
(H
k
)] may intersect
(see [26, 7]).
8 Spectrum of symbolic image
By construction, the linear extension LG depends on the choice of the linear
mappings {a[ji] : R
i
→ R
j
} for the edges {i → j} of G(PF). The mapping
a[ji] is determined by the choice of a point (x,y)∈ M(i), (x,y)∈ M(j) since
a[ji]l = A(x)e(y)l, where e(y) ∈ L(y), |e(y)| = 1. It follows from here that
the characteristic exponent depends on the choice as well. Let us examine
the variation of exponent under admissible variations of the linear mappings
{a[ji];R
i
→Rj}.
Let ω = {z
0
,z
1
,...,z
p
= z
0
} be a periodic path on G(PF). By deﬁnition,
the characteristic exponent of the path ω for a linear extension LG is of the
form
λ(w) =
1
p
p
X
k=1
ln|a[z
k
z
k−1
]|,
where each|a[z
k
z
k−1
]| =|a[ji]| is determined by the edgei→j rather then the
number k. In other words, if the path ω passes through the edge i→j twice,
i.e. z

=i, z

=j andz
l−1

ln|α[z

where each α[z

through an edge i→j, i.e., z
k−1
=i, z
k
=j z

α[z

z

] is deﬁned
as
α[z

z
k−1
] =a(x,y), where (x,y)∈M(z
k−1
),
i.e., we do not require that the image F(x,y) is in M(z
k
).
Deﬁnition 8 Let ω = {z
0
,z
1
,...,z
p
= z
0
} be an admissible periodic path on
the symbolic image G(PF). A nonstationary exponent σ(w) of the path ω is
deﬁned by the equality
σ(w) =
1
p
p
X
k=1
ln|α[z

where
α[z

), k = 1,....p.
Itisclearthatthenonstationaryexponentσ(ω)admitsmorevariationthan

Deﬁnition 9 The set
Σ(G(PF)) ={σ∈R : there is a sequence of periodic paths ω
k
on G(PF)
with nonstationary exponents σ(ω
k
) such that σ(ω
k
)→σ as k→∞}
is called a spectrum of the symbolic imageG(PF) on the set of recurrent vertices
RV.
It is evident that the spectrum Σ(G(PF)) does not depend on linear exten-
sion LG. To ﬁnd the spectrum of a symbolic image we introduce the following
notations
α(i) = min
(x,y)∈M(i)
|a(x,y)|, β(i) = max
(x,y)∈M(i)
|a(x,y)|.
Since each cell M(i) is compact, there are points (x
∗
,y
∗
) and (x
∗∗
,y
∗∗
)∈M(i)
such that α(i) = |a(x

)|. The maximal and the
minimal nonstationary exponents

where σ(ω) is any nonstationary exponent, and λ(ω) is any characteristic ex-
ponent of a linear extension LG. Let φ

,...,φ
q
be a full collection of simple
periodic paths of class H with periods p
1
,...,p
q
, respectively. Set
Λ

(H) = min{Λ
min
(φ

), j = 1,...,q},
Λ

(H) = max{Λ

(φ

Theorem 2 The spectrum Σ(G(PF)) of the symbolic image G(PF) consists
of the intervals{[Λ
min
(H
k
),Λ
max
(H
k
)]}, where {H
k
} is the full family of classes
of equivalent recurrent vertices on the symbolic image G(PF).
Proof. We ﬁx a class H of equivalent recurrent vertices on the symbolic
image. As indicated above, Λ
min
(φ
j
) and Λ
max
(φ
j
) are realized as some nonsta-
tionaryexponentsunderacorrespondingchoiceof α[z
k
z
k−1
]. Sincethenumber
of simple periodic paths is ﬁnite, the exponents Λ
min
(H) and Λ
max
(H) are re-
alized as well. By repeating the proof of Proposition 2, one can show that each
nonstationary exponent of a periodic path is an arithmetic mean of nonstation-
ary exponents of simple periodic paths with corresponding weights. From this
it follows that the spectrum Σ(G(PF)) of the symbolic image G(PF) is in
S
k
[Λ
min
(H
k
),Λ
max
(H
k
)], where {H
k
} is the full family of classes of equivalent
recurrent vertices on the symbolic image G(PF). By repeating the proof of
Proposition 4, one can show that each λ ∈ [Λ
min
(H
k
),Λ
max
(H
k
)] belongs to
the spectrum of a symbolic image. Thus,
Σ(G(PF)) =
[
k
[Λ

(H

where {H

} is the full family of classes of equivalent recurrent vertices of the
symbolic image G(PF).

Theorem 3 The spectrum Σ(G(PF)) offers the properties:
1) spectrum of any linear extension Σ(LG) is in Σ(G(PF)),
2) Morse spectrum Σ(F) is in Σ(G(PF)).
Proof. 1) From the deﬁnition of a nonstationary exponent it follows, that
each characteristic exponent λ(ω) of the periodic path ω = {z
0
,z
1
,...z
p
= z
0
}
can be realized as a nonstationary exponentσ(ω) settingα[z
k
z
k−1
] =a[z

],
k = 1,....p. From this it follows that the characteristic exponent λ(ω) of any
linear extension LG is in the spectrum of a symbolic image.

2) Let us show that for any periodic ε-trajectory
ξ ={(x

),(x

),...,(x

wherer is the lower bound of a symbolic image, there is an admissible periodic
path ω = {z

p

} such that the characteristic exponent λ(ξ) =
1
p
P
p−1
k=0
ln|a(x

)| ofξ is realized as a nonstationary exponentσ(ω) ofω. Let a
vertexz
k
be such that (x
k
,y
k
)∈M(z
k
). Sinceε<r, according to Proposition
1 the path ω = {z
0
,z
1
,...,z
p
= z
0
} is an admissible periodic path on the
symbolic image. By setting α[z
k
z

k−1
), we obtain
σ(ω) =

Hence, a characteristic exponent of any periodic ε-trajectory, ε < r, is in
Σ(G(PF)). Since the Morse spectrum is a limit set of periodicε-trajectories as
ε→ 0, it is in the spectrum of symbolic image Σ(G(PF)).

According to Proposition 1, each ε-trajectory with ε < r is realized as an

Proof. According to Theorem 3, the Morse spectrum is in the spectrum of
a symbolic image. Thus, it is suﬃcient to prove that the last is in the described
family of intervals. Let σ be in the spectrum of a symbolic image. This means
that there is a sequence of periodic paths ω

Since all exponents λ(ω

Theorem 5 guarantees that a good estimate for Morse spectrum can be
obtained if the largest cell diameter d of the covering C(P) is suﬃciently
small. However, we do not have suitable estimate for the diameter d. In this
case an algorithm constructing a monotone sequvence of sets converging to the
Morse spectrum is of greatest practical utility. Let us consider one of them.

10 Localization of the chain recurrent set
Denote by RV(d) the union of cells M(i) for which the vertices i are recurrent
:
RV(d) ={
[
M(i) :i are recurrent},
wheredisthelargestdiameterofthecellsM(i). Itshouldbenotedthatinfact
the constructed set RV(d) depends on the covering C(P). However, in what
follows we need only to consider the dependence of RV(d) on d.
Theorem 6 [16]
1. The set RV(d) is a closed neighborhood of the chain recurrent set CR.
Moreover,RV(d) is a subset ofε-periodic points set for anyε>q+d, i.e.,
RV(d)⊂Per(ε), ε>q+d.
2. The chain recurrent set CR coincides with an intersection of the sets
RV(d) for all positive d:
CR =
\
d>0
RV(d).
Theorem 6 makes possible to localize the chain recurrent set without pre-
liminary information on a dynamical system [16]. The subdivision is a main
step of the construction.
11 Subdivision process
LetC ={M(i)}beacoveringofP andGbeasymbolicimageforC. Supposea
newcoveringNC isproducedbytakingasubdivisionofC,i.e.,eachcellM(i)is
subdivided. Denote byNG the symbolic image forNC. It is a convenience the
cells of the new covering to designate as M(i,k). Thus, the cells M(i,k), k =
1,2,... , form a partition of the cell M(i):
[
k
M(i,k) =M(i).
Theverticesofthenewsymbolicimagearedenotedas(i,k). Somecellsarenot
excluded actually to be not subdivided, i.e., M(i,1) = M(i). The described
subdivision generates a natural mapping S from NG on G which takes the
vertices(i,k), k = 1,...,ontothevertexi. SincefromPF(M(i,k))∩M(j,l)6=∅
it follows PF(M(i))∩M(j) 6= ∅, the directed edge (i,k) → (j,l) is mapped
Electronic Journal.  39Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 1999
onto the directed edge i→j. Hence, the mapping S takes the directed graph
NG into the directed graph G.
An algorithm localizing the chain recurrent set CR is available in [16]. It
consists of the following steps:
1. Starting with an initial covering C, the symbolic image G of the map PF
is found. The cells of the initial covering may have arbitrary diameterd
0
.
2. The recurrent vertices {i
k
} of the graph G are recognized. Using the
recurrent vertices, a closed neighborhoodV ={∪M(i
k
) : i
k
isrecurrent}
of the chain recurrent set CR is found.
3. The cells corresponding to recurrent vertices{M(i
k
) :i
k
isrecurrent} are
subdivided. For example, the largest diameter of the cells may be divided
by 2. Thus, the new covering is deﬁned.
4. The symbolic image G is constructed for the new covering. It should
be noted that the new symbolic image may be constructed on the set
V ={∪M(i
k
) : i
k
is recurrent}. In other words, the cells corresponding
to non recurrent vertices do not participate in the construction of the new
covering and the new symbolic image.
5. Then one goes back to the second step.
Repeating this subdivision process we obtain a sequence of neighborhoods

diameters d

12 Localization of Morse spectrum
Let us modify the subdivision process to localize the Morse spectrum of a
dynamicalsystem. TothisendweapplythesubdivisionprocesstomappingPF
and after the second step of the described algorithm we produce the following

. The classes {H
m
} of equivalent recurrent vertices are found, and the
family of simple periodic paths{φ

} is recognized for each class H
m
,

. The intervals I
m
= [Λ
min
(H
m
),Λ
max
(H

)] are determined by using the
families{φ
m
j
}.
Then one goes to the third step. Repeating the subdivision process and the
calculation of intervals I
m
we obtain
1) a sequence of neighborhoods{V
k
} of the chain recurrent set,
2) a sequence of the largest diameters of cells{d
k
},
3) a sequence of families of intervals{I
k
m
}.
Theorem 8 The constructed sequence of intervals offers the following proper-
ties:
(i) each set Σ

contains the Morse spectrum of F,
(ii) the sets Σ

(iii) if d

lim

Σ

Proof. (i) follows from Theorem 3, and (iii) is a corollary of Theorem
5. To prove the statement (ii) we consider a covering C = {M(i)} and a new
covering NC ={m(ij)} which is a subdivision of C, i.e., ∪
j
m(ij) =M(i). Let
G and NG be symbolic images for the coverings C and NC, respectively. As
indicated above, there is the mappingS :NG→G taking the directed graphs.
In particular, S takes a periodic path on some periodic path. However, an
image of simple path may be not simple periodic path. Consider an interval
NI = [Λ
min
(NH),Λ
max
(NH)] corresponding to some class NH of the new
symbolic image. Since the mapping S takes the equivalent periodic paths into
the equivalent periodic paths, the image S(NH) is in some class H. Let us
prove that the interval I = [Λ
min
(H),Λ
max
(H)] contains the interval NI. In
fact, according to Theorem 2, there is a simple periodic path φ ⊂ NG on

13 Exponential estimates
Let us apply of the obtained results to estimate an action of the mapping
F along an ε-trajectory ξ = {(x
i
,y
i
)}. According to Proposition 1, if ε <
r, r is a lower bound of symbolic image, then there is an admissible path
ω = {z
i
} corresponding to the ε-trajectory ξ where z
i
: (x
i
,y
i
) ∈ M(z
i
). By
Theorem 2, the spectrum of the symbolic image Σ(G(PF)) consists of the
intervals {[Λ
min
(H
k
),Λ
max
(H
k
)]}, where {H
k
} is the full family of equivalent
recurrentverticesclasses. Theinterval[Λ

a spectrum of class H.
Theorem 9 If the spectrum of class H is in an interval [a,b] then there ex-
ist positive constants K
∗
and K
∗
such that for any ﬁnite ε-trajectory ξ =
{(x

),(x

for which the corresponding admissible path ω = {z

in H, the following estimate holds

Proof. Recall that each directed edge i → j induces the value α[ji] =
a(x,y), |a(x,y)| = |F(x,e(y))|, where (x,y) ∈ M(i), e(y) is a base vector in
one-dimension space L(y).
First we obtain the desired estimates for a simple periodic path. Let ψ =
{z
0
,z
1
,...z
p
=z
0
} be a simple periodic path in the classH. By ﬁxing the values
α[z

], k = 1,...,p, one can ﬁnd a nonstationary exponent
σ(ψ) =
1
p
p

k=1
ln|α[z

Since it is in the interval [a,b], we obtain the inequality
a≤

ln|α[z

From this it follows the estimate

Now, consider any path ω = {z
0
,z

p
} in the class H. Let us decompose
ω in a sum of simple paths as it done above. Let the path ω pass through a
vertex z

} and ω

= {z

,z
l+1

}. By
construction, the path ω

is an admissible periodic path of period p

. We say
that the path ω is a sum of paths ω

and ω

, i.e.,
ω =ω

where ω

We start with a product Π(ω

For each factor Π

Proof. First, note that the estimate (6) holds for the trajectory ξ. If

14 Chain-recurrent components in the project bundle
A subset Ω⊂CR is called a component of the chain-recurrent set if each two
points from Ω can be connected by a periodic ε-trajectory for any ε> 0.
Recallsomeinformationonattractors. AclosedinvariantLyapunovasymp-
totically stable set is called an attractor. An attractor of the inverse mapping
f

is called a repeller of f. An intersection of an attractor and a repeller is
called a Morse set.

neighborhood U of A such that
f(cl U)⊂U, A =

The family{Ω

[26] proved that the described property holds not only for a component of the
chain-recurrent set but for each Morse set Ω
∗
on the projective bundle. The
decomposition described in (i)-(iii) is called the ﬁnest Morse decomposition on
the projective bundle.
LetC(M) ={m(j)} be a covering of the manifoldM andC(P) ={M(z)}
be an agreed covering of the projective space P, i.e., a natural projection of
each cell is a cell: Pπ(M(z)) = m(j). We denote by G(f) and G(PF) the
symbolic images of f and PF, respectively. As indicated above, for the agreed
coverings there is a ”natural projection”h(z) =j fromG(PF) onG(f), where
Pπ(M(z)) =m(j). Moreover, the mapping h takes the directed graph G(PF)
on the directed graph G(f).
Theorem 11 Let G(f) and G(PF) be the symbolic images of the mappings f
and PF for the agreed coverings C(M) and C(P), respectively. If H is a class

Proof. The statement (i) follows from (ii)-(iv). The statement (ii) follows
from the results of the paper [18]. The statements (iii) and (iv) are proved
in [5], p. 117. Corollary 2 guarantees the validity of (v). The statement (vi)
follows from Theorem 6.
