Abstract
In this paper the author deals with the Schr¨ odinger equation of the two-dimensi-
onal envelope surfaces of the water waves and discusses the robustness about
the propagation direction of this equation. In the ﬁeld of the water and/or
the plasma, the Schr¨ odinger equation governs the envelope created by the nearly
monochromaticwaves, whichenergyisalmostconcentratedinasinglefrequency.
The two-dimensional Schr¨ odinger equation, which governs the envelope surface
instead of the envelope of the one-dimensional system, is obtained through theDifferential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2002
straightforward process from the one-dimensional system. The obtained two-
dimensional Schr¨ odinger equation contains the parameter of the propagation di-
rection. The author shows that the two-dimensional Schr¨ odinger equation is
robust about the propagation direction, i.e., the small variation of the propaga-
tion direction makes no change of the original equation.
1. INTRODUCTION
The Schr¨ odinger equation governs the envelope of the group waves [1][2], which
propagate in the water and the plasma, etc. Moreover, the non-linear Schr¨ oding-
er equation governs the non-linearity of the envelope. The fact that the solution
for the non-linear Schr¨ odinger equation can be a soliton[3][4] is known and of
interest [5]. Many studies of the group waves have been carried out in the water
wave area and some other area as well. For example, in the ﬁber-optic commu-
nication system, the GDV (Group Velocity Dispersion), in which problem the
launched pulse may spread outside its timing window due to dispersion, limits
the transmission data rate caused by the pulse overlapping between adjacent
timing windows. Non-linear refraction of SPM (Self-Phase Modulation) can also
limitthesystemperformancebycausingspectralbroadeningoftheopticalpulse.
Those effects are also described by the linear or non-linear Schr¨ odinger equation
and analyzed to achieve the optimal system performance [6].
Inthispaper,thegoverningequationoftheenvelopesurfacecreatedbynearly
monochromatic waves, which forms the two-dimensional Schr¨ odinger type equa-
tion, are derived [7][8][9] and its characteristics of robustness about the propaga-
tion direction of the representative style are discussed. The spectrum of nearly
monochromatic waves is almost concentrated on a single frequency. Such waves
create the envelope in a one-dimensional system. In a two-dimensional system,
the envelope surface instead of the envelope in a one-dimensional system can
be considered. Two-dimensional nearly monochromatic waves also create the
envelope surface. The obtained two-dimensional Schr¨ odinger equation contains
the parameter of the propagation direction. The author shows that the two-
dimensional Schr¨ odinger equation is robust about the propagation direction, i.e.,
the small variation of the propagation direction makes no change of the original
equation.
The following section presents the background of the envelope equation (the
Schr¨ odinger equation) of one-dimensional nearly monochromatic waves. The
author also gives the general form of the envelope equation and the comprehen-
sion of the meaning of the spatial derivative of the envelope. The third section
Electronic Journal.  54Differential Equations and Control Processes, N 4, 2002
deals with the straightforward expansion of the Schr¨ odinger equation to the two-
dimensional space of nearly monochromatic waves. The forth section discusses
the robustness of the derived two-dimensional equation about the propagation
direction. Finally, in the ﬁfth section concluding remarks are presented.
2. REVIEW: GOVERNING EQUATIONS
OF THE ENVELOPE OF NEARLY
MONOCHROMATIC WAVES[10]
Plane traveling waves with dispersive characteristics of the form:
u(x,t) = A(x,t)e
i{k
0
x−ω(k
0
)t}
(1)
are considered. Here, A,k
0
,ω,x and t denote amplitude, wave number, angular
frequency, travelling direction of waves and time, respectively.
This is based on the assumption that most of the energy is concentrated in
one wave number k
0
(nearly monochromatic waves) and the amplitude A(x,t)is
not constant but varies slowly is space and time. The amplitude A(x,t) acts as
an envelope of the traveling wave.
The governing Equation of the envelope is obtained as follows. The exact
solution of u(x,t) is represented as
u(x,t) =
Z
k
S(k)e
i{kx−ω(k)t}
dk. (2)
Here, S(k) is the spectrum of the waves. So, A(x,t) is derived from Eq.(1) and
Eq.(2).
A(x,t) =

where

On the other hand, the linear dispersion relation of ω(k) can be written as
the following Taylor expansion:

Eq.(9) represents the linear higher order governing equation that governs the
amplitudeofnearlymonochromaticwaves,thatis,theequationthattheenvelope
of nearly monochromatic waves satisﬁes. Neglecting the third and higher order
of spatial derivatives in Eq. (9), we obtain the linear Schr¨ odinger equation [10]:

In the remainder of this section, we treat the non-linear case [11] of the
dispersionrelation. Thenon-lineardispersionrelationisappliedtoEq.(5)instead
of the linear dispersion relation of Eq.(7). We consider the non-linear dispersion
relation to be the following:
ω = ω(k,A(x,t)

and then we expand ω in a Taylor series about k = k
0
and |A(x,t)|

This is the non-linear Schr¨ odinger equation with cubic non-linearity. The cubic

SURFACE OF NEARLY MONOCHROMATIC WAVES
Intheprevioussection,wetreatthegoverningequationoftheenvelopesurfaceof
nearly monochromatic waves, in which waves its propagation direction is single.
That is, Eq. (30) presents the linear dynamics of the envelope surface of nearly
monochromatic waves with a single propagation direction. We deal with the
governing equation of the envelope surface of nearly monochromatic waves for
the robustness consideration of multi-directionality of the propagation direction
in this section.
Here the traveling wave whose propagation direction exists in two closely
separated angles is considered. Let A

Therefore the two-dimensional governing equation of the envelope surface of
nearly monochromatic waves with two closely separated propagation directions
is obtained by substituting Eq.(7), Eq.(50), Eq.(55) and Eq.(56) into Eq.(58).

Equation (59) and Eq.(60) are expanded to two propagation directions from
Eq.(30) and Eq.(31) with its one propagation direction, respectively. We can
ﬁnd that Eq.(59) and Eq.(60) hold the identical forms of Eq.(30) and Eq.(31).

This fact shows that two-dimensional governing equation of the envelope surface
retains the robustness of directionality, that is, the governing equation of the en-
velope surface of the nearly monochromatic waves with two closely propagation
directions is the same of the equation with a single propagation direction. How-
ever, this is based on the approximation of Eq.(38) and neglecting the second
order term or higher of Δ. Moreover, Eq.(32) is not satisﬁed with in the case of
two closely propagation directions, but stands up in the meaning of approxima-
tion of small Δ , that is

The non-linear version considered in this section is obtained in a similar way
of applying Eq.(12) to Eq.(58). The result is also the identical form of Eq.(36)
using A
θ
(x,y,t) instead of A(x,y,t).
5.CONCLUDING REMARK
This paper presents that the governing equation of the envelope surface (two-
dimensional Schr¨ odinger equation), which is created by the two-dimensional,
nearly monochromatic waves, holds the robustness of the propagation direction
in its representative form.
In the early stage of this paper, the author reviews the Schr¨ odinger equa-
tion of one-dimensional nearly monochromatic waves. Then two-dimensional
Schr¨ odingerequation, whichisformedbythetwo-dimensional, nearlymonochro-
maticwaveswithasinglepropagationdirection,isderivedbythestraightforward
expansion from the one-dimensional case. In order to present the robustness in
terms of the propagation direction of the two-dimensional Schr¨ odinger equa-
tion, the author derives the governing equation of the envelope surface, which is
created by the two-dimensional, nearly monochromatic waves with two closely
separated propagation directions. The fact that two derived governing equa-
tions, which correspond to a single propagation direction and two propagation
directions, have the same expression is shown.
