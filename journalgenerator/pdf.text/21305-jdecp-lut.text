Abstract. The article is devoted to the study of the inverse problem for a
high-order Sobolev type equation. Mathematical models based on such equa-
tions describe various problems of hydrodynamics and elasticity theory. The
main result of the article is to  nd su cient conditions for the existence and
uniqueness of a solution to the original problem. At  rst using the theory of
relatively bounded operators, the original problem is reduced to the equivalent
system of two problems, which are usually called regular and singular. Thus,
the solution to the original problem is represented as the sum of the solutions
of these two problems. Further, the regular problem is reduced to a  rst-order
equation. Then, by the method of successive approximations, the required
smoothness for the function q is achieved by obtaining su cient conditions for
the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the regular problem. To  nd a
solution of the singular problem, the phase space method and the results of the
study of the regular problem are used. The results obtained can be applied to
the study of various mathematical models, such as the model of sound waves
in smectics or the model of oscillation of a rotating viscous uid taking into
account the viscosity coe cient.
Keywords: Sobolev type equation, inverse problem, method of successive ap-
proximations, relative boundedness of operator.Differential Equations and Control Processes, N. 3, 2021
1 Introduction
LetU;F;Y be Banach spaces, operators L; M 2 L(U;F); C 2 L(U;Y),
ker L 6= f0g; given functions   : [0;T ] ! L(Y;F); f : [0;T ] ! F;
	 : [0;T ]!Y: Consider the following problem

Cv(t) = 	(t); (3)
where (1) is an incomplete, inhomogeneous high-order Sobolev type equation,
(2) is the Cauchy condition, and (3) is the overdetermination condition. The
problem of  nding a pair of functions v2 C
n
([0;T ];U) and q2 C
1
([0;T ];Y)
from relations (1) { (3) is called the inverse problem.
A large number of works is an devoted to the study of Sobolev type equa-
tions [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12]. The article [4] gives su cient conditions for the
existence of positive solutions to both the Showalter { Sidorov problem and the
Cauchy problem for an abstract linear equation of the  rst order (n = 1). The
Cauchy problem for a nonlinear Sobolev type differential equation in the space
of continuous functions was studied in [11]. The paper [12] is devoted to initial-
boundary value problems for a Sobolev type equation with a Gerasimov-Caputo
fractional derivative with a memory effect.
Sobolev type equations  nd their application in mathematical modeling
[3, 5, 6]. In [6], the su cient conditions for the solvability of a high-order
semilinear Sobolev type mathematical model were obtained. Consideration
of optimal equation problems for linear Sobolev type models with the initial
Cauchy condition is presented in [5].
Recently, a large number of works [3, 7, 8, 9, 10] are devoted to the study
of inverse problems in various aspects. The question of well-posedness of the
inverse problem of determining the source function for a second order quasilinear
parabolic system in Sobolev spaces was considered in [9]. The article [8] is
devoted to establishing the uniqueness of the solution to the coe cient inverse
problem of wave tomography in the non-overdetermined setting. The solvability
of the inverse problem for  rst-order partial differential equations was studied in
[10]. In [7] the solvability of several inverse problems belonging to the same class
of Sobolev type equations is studied. Work [3] establishes the unique solvability
of the inverse problem for a complete second-order Sobolev type equation.

2 Preliminary Information
To  nd a pair of functions v(t) and q(t) we use the results obtained in the
research of higher order Sobolev type equations [1].

and 
L

the operator M, respectively.
De nition 2 The operator-function ( L M)
 1
with domain  
L
(M) will be
called the L-resolvent of the operator M.
De nition 3 The operator M is called (L; )-bounded if

De nition 4 The point1 is called
(i) a removable singular point of the L-resolvent of operator M, if H O;
(ii) a pole of order p2 N of the L-resolvent of operator M, if H

(iii) an essentially singular point of the L-resolvent of operator M,
if H

Remark 1 If the operator M is (L; )-bounded, and1 is a pole of order
p2f0g[N of the L-resolvent of the operator M, then the operator M is called
(L;p)-bounded.
3 Reduction of the Initial Inverse Problem
Let the operator M be (L;p)-bounded, then v(t) can be represented as
v(t) = Pv(t) + (I P )v(t). Denote Pv(t) = u(t); (I P )v(t) = !(t). Sup-
pose thatU
